Kara Holsopple: Thank you for speaking with me, and congratulations on your Heinz Award.

Sacoby Wilson: Thank you. It’s great to be a winner of the 30th Heinz Awards. And it’s pretty overwhelming, quite humbling. Actually, when they called me, I literally cried, which I normally don’t do. But it is a huge deal. It is great when you’re honored for your work and with all the things that are happening in the country, the anti-environmental justice sentiment, this not just a recognition for me, but a recognition for the entire environmental justice movement. That we are on the right path, that we are doing God’s work, and that we’re having impact. So, it’s a great honor for me.

Kara Holsopple: Tell me a little bit about the work that T.H.E. EJ Lab does. What’s your mission?

Sacoby Wilson: Our mission is to do research that supports communities that are experiencing environmental justice issues. There are many communities around the country, populations due to their race or income, who tend to have a higher burden of environmental hazards, things like landfills, power plants.

What we do is provide scientific, technical assistance to those communities. One of my main buckets of work is really air quality monitoring. We build a lot of hyperlocal air quality monitor networks, and we do what we call community-based monitoring. Community members live in places with these stationary or mobile sources of pollution. They are the contextual experts. They have the lived experience; they know what’s going on. We want to make sure the monitoring is responsive to their needs and concerns.

We’ve done monitoring in Charleston, South Carolina, around the port expansion in North Charleston. We’ve done monitoring in Prince George’s County Schools, trying to educate young people about air pollution in their schools, to help empower them, educate them so they can do something about it. That’s one of our biggest areas of work is really helping communities get the tools and the data around air quality so they can translate to action.

[O]ne of our biggest areas of work is really helping communities get the tools and the data around air quality so they can translate to action.

Kara Holsopple: What’s your philosophy on engaging residents in your work, and what does that look like on the ground?

Sacoby Wilson: You know, early on in my career, usually community groups or residents would get to know us through a green group. They have this environmental problem or environmental health issue, and so initially they would contact the Sierra Club or a group like that. Then it would be like a referral process. But over time now people really got to know the EJ Lab and the work that we do. People contact us directly.

Most of the work that we do when it comes to engaging residents is in collaboration with a local grassroots organization. In many cases, they’re reacting to building a new facility. That’s usually what happens, or a facility is getting a permit. We built this network in the region where grassroots organizations are working together. Grassroots organizations are working with academic partners.

We also have community-university partnerships where communities are helping to build the study design. They develop the research questions, help drive the study, design, etc. So a lot of it is really ground-up research. They are working with partners like us, partners that they trust. And that trust has been built over years, in some cases decades of working together.

Kara Holsopple: President Trump and his administration are doing away with environmental justice funding, staffing and initiatives in the federal government. They are also targeting universities that work on racial and other disparities. What impact does or will that have on your work and others in the field?

Sacoby Wilson: It’s had a tremendous negative impact. We’ve had grants that I would say have been illegally terminated on the university side. I am, I was going to say was, but I am the co-director of the U.S. EPA Region 3 TCTAC. That’s the Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Center. The idea behind this center is to provide technical assistance for front-line, fence-line groups that are impacted by environmental and justice issues to build a capacity to apply for funding, including federal grants.

It’s been a huge negative impact of the administration when it comes to the illegal termination grants, and shutting down the programs like the Community Change Grant Program. I think the Community Change Grant Program, was a $2 billion fund, probably one of the EPA’s best programs in its history.

That program would have provided monies, in some cases, $20 million for collaborations to look at climate action strategies. So think about putting in EV charging stations, putting in solar, training folks in how to do HVAC, putting in green infrastructure, tracking reduction of greenhouse gases, and those important co-pollutants like particulate matter. Improving people’s lives and also providing jobs.

But guess what? The EJ movement is about people and what can be disassembled could be reassembled.

That would have had many co-benefits and dividends, so that $20 million investment could have led to $100 million of return of co-benefits because of reducing pollution, improving health outcomes, and providing jobs. So you’re saving lives, saving money, and creating opportunity. That was a beautiful program. I think that’s a loss for the country. Many of the grants that have been canceled also impacted rural, low-income, white residents, and impacted folks who already had a lack of access to good infrastructure in rural areas.

Also, the dismantling of the environmental justice infrastructure at the federal level. The hard work of folks in the Office of Environmental Justice. A small but mighty team in the EPA for years that was really not provided the support until the last [EPA] administrator, Administrator Regan. [He was] probably the administrator who did the most on environmental justice, who really led with his heart and really provided the infrastructure and leadership. So having that infrastructure dismantled is problematic.

But guess what? The EJ movement is about people and what can be disassembled could be reassembled. So the movement, it’s not over. The movement wasn’t ended. It’s just a delay. Yes, the money is a problem, but what is the statement? The revolution will not be televised, nor will it be funded. We went for years without having money in the EJ movement and getting things done. I think it’s going to make the movement stronger because we have more power together. Let’s move forward better together in this moment.

Kara Holsopple: You’ve been in the environmental justice field for a while now. What changes have you seen in how environmental justice work is perceived and the impact that it’s made in these communities?

Sacoby Wilson: I was on the EPA, am I still on it? I’m not sure, but I was on the EPA Science Advisory Board. And for the first time at the EPA Science Advisory Board, they started focusing on environmental justice. I was part of the Fifth National Climate Assessment, a very important annual climate assessment that talks about climate change and what we need to do. We had environmental justice in the Fifth National Climate Assessment in every chapter. That’s huge.

[There’s] lot of work at the state level as well when it comes to building programs, initiatives, and passing legislation and policies that really help to advance environmental justice and address environmental injustices.

You see academic institutions focusing more on environmental justice. You still don’t have a lot of degree programs yet, which I think is problematic. But you see more classes, more people doing research. And also, there are many more nonprofits out there doing environmental justice work.

You have a lot of alliances and networks around the country where folks have come together. You see more community-based groups focusing on environmental justice, and you’re seeing more networks, alliances, coalitions coming together to really push on environmental justice. That’s been a change. And then you also see more intersectional work with climate change, reproductive justice, others. I think people see what environmental justice is as a framework.

And also you’re seeing more policy change. Let me not forget that. We’ve seen legislation across the country trying to pass at the federal level the EJ For All Act, which hasn’t passed, but I know they will keep at it, just like we kept at the Civil Rights Act.

At the state level, all the actions, of course, in California, around environmental justice, climate justice. We just had Governor Westmore over a month ago sign an executive order of environmental justice for the state of Maryland. Even in many of our red states, where you haven’t seen as much progress, some states have EJ commissions. South Carolina had an EJ commission. So you’ve seen a lot of work, not just the federal level, but a lot of work at the state level as well when it comes to building programs, initiatives, and passing legislation and policies that really help to advance environmental justice and address environmental injustices.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilson_Sacoby.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 17:02:23.600237

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed course on their plans to delay air pollution compliance for coke oven plants, after Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit on behalf of a coalition of clean air and community public health advocacy groups.

In western Pennsylvania, northwest Indiana, Ohio, Alabama and other states, coke ovens – which burn coal to produce a hard deposit that facilities use to make steel – emit lead, mercury, benzene, and other hazardous, cancer-causing air pollutants. In 2024, EPA finalized updates to the emissions standards for these toxic facilities after years of delay, which required monitoring for benzene in nearby communities and set caps on previously unregulated emissions. But in July of this year, in a move that catered to corporate pressure, Trump’s EPA issued an interim final rule, delaying compliance until July 2027.

The group’s lawsuit challenged EPA’s interim final rule, as it deprived nearby residents and communities of protection against toxic air pollution. Rather than defend the interim final rule in litigation, EPA reversed course. In a brief filed with the D.C. Circuit, EPA now affirms its prior finding that coke ovens are fully capable of complying with the 2024 rule, thereby acknowledging that the delay of compliance dates was never needed.

“Given the harm coke ovens’ emissions cause to communities, we are gratified to see EPA acknowledge that these facilities can and should meet emissions standards now,” said Adrienne Lee, Earthjustice senior attorney. “We hope that EPA will reconsider its similarly unjustified action in delaying air standards at steel mills, many of which are located in the same communities as coke ovens.”

Quotes from our clients and partners

“It is good news that that the Trump EPA is abandoning its unlawful attempt to delay the compliance deadlines for recently updated air pollution control rules for steel industry coke ovens,” said Haley Lewis, attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project. “Communities living near these facilities waited many years for these rules to be finalized by EPA in 2024 and putting them into action now is vital for reducing hazardous air pollution and protecting people living near these plants.”

“We welcome EPA’s withdrawal of its proposal to weaken the Biden-era coke oven rule,” said Jilisa Milton, executive director of Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution. “For our communities living near Bluestone Coke and ABC Coke, keeping stronger protections in place is another important step toward safeguarding public health after years of experiencing the effects of toxic pollution.”

“We fought for years to get these national regulations passed so that our communities would be better protected from the toxic pollutants that spew from coke oven facilities,” said Abby Jones, vice president of legal and policy at PennFuture. “While we fought against the Trump Administration’s efforts to delay their implementation, we are pleased that EPA has reconsidered its actions in light of the massive public response opposing the delay and the fact that the companies can comply within the original deadline. Allowing the 2024 coke oven regulations to take effect as originally planned will save countless lives and will provide much needed protection for frontline communities in Pennsylvania.”

“For communities hosting these coke ovens, today sees the withdrawal of a misguided attempt to excuse these terrible polluting facilities from the duty to reduce their cancer-causing emissions,” said Jane Williams, chair of the Sierra Club National Clean Air Team. “These coke ovens emit benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and many other toxic air pollutants; it is long past time that they took every effort to reduce these emissions.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-10-03 17:02:11.732604

That's more than any other GM plant — though Oshawa won its most recent award in 2013.
The Oshawa plant has a highly skilled workforce that makes GM a highly profitable truck, Gray says.
Ideally, he says it would be great if GM were to retool the Oshawa plant to build EVs.","General Motors has employed workers in Oshawa for generations. So while its presence in the city has been declining for decades, GM still looms large culturally, as hundreds of workers are expected to be laid off in the plant in the new year.

GM began its Canadian operations in Oshawa back in 1918. The auto giant has said it's working on a plan to keep building in Oshawa for another 100 years.

But in the face of U.S. auto tariffs, what's the future of the plant? Here's what we've been hearing during our reporting on the looming layoffs.

GM will still build trucks

As first announced in 2023, GM is spending $280 million to build the next generation of Chevrolet Silverados in Oshawa.

The associated plant upgrades are currently underway, spokesperson Ariane Pereira said in an email.

WATCH | Some 2,000 workers will be laid off when GM cuts a shift in the new year:

How GM’s job cuts in Oshawa loom large over one worker

September 29Duration4:25Oshawa native Todd Forbes is one of some 2,000 workers who are set to be laid off in January when General Motors cuts the third shift at its Oshawa, Ont., plant. Some are considering moving elsewhere, amid high unemployment rates in the city and an auto industry under threat from U.S. tariffs.

The plant currently makes heavy and light-duty Chevy Silverados on the same line — the only GM plant to do so, according to the company's website.

You might think it seems contradictory that GM is committing to building new trucks in Oshawa despite cutting a shift next year. But the additional product mandate is a really good sign for the plant's future, says Dimitry Anastakis, the L.R. Wilson and R.J. Currie Chair in Canadian business history at the University of Toronto.

That's going to be a huge boost in confidence, he said.

Even if it does go down to two shifts, you've got a guarantee for the foreseeable future of significant production, which means significant employment, Anastakis said.

Chris Waugh, Unifor chairperson for the Oshawa plant, said he wouldn't comment on the impact of this production on workers.

Employment peaked in 1980s

CBC News has heard from some readers who say GM jobs are not important for Oshawa anymore. They've argued the city's auto industry has been in decline for decades, and the city has moved onto other industries, including health care and technology.

It's true the plant has dwindled in size over the past several decades, going from a peak of 23,000 employees in the 1980s to some 3,000 employees now.

Today, manufacturing industries only employ about three per cent of Oshawa's workforce, city data shows.

But the GM plant is still a major employer of well-paying jobs with benefits, says Jeff Gray, president of Unifor Local 222, which represents the workers.

Here's the autoworkers' case

Oshawa autoworkers also appear to be good at their jobs. The plant has won 9 J.D. Power Initial Quality Study awards, which study new vehicle quality. That's more than any other GM plant — though Oshawa won its most recent award in 2013.

It's also worth noting that pick up trucks — or as Anastakis puts it, big gas guzzling vehicles — continue to be in high demand in North America.

The Oshawa plant has a highly skilled workforce that makes GM a highly profitable truck, Gray says.

We make [GM] a lot of money, he says. We've been doing that for several decades.

Our business case is great, Gray says, and it's not just him trying to make this case. He says Lana Payne, Unifor's national president, is pressing the federal government to come to a trade agreement with the U.S. that would put Canadian auto workers back on a level playing field.

CBC News has also heard that representatives from all levels of government are in regular talks with GM.

Building military vehicles is on the table

One possibility for the Oshawa plant is it could begin building military vehicles — and there is some precedent for this.

In July 2024, the Canadian military awarded GM Defense Canada a $35.8-million contract to build 90 light tactical vehicles — although they were built in North Carolina, according to media reports.

GM says it cannot comment on future product planning in Oshawa for competitive reasons. Oshawa Mayor Dan Carter also declined to provide details on his meetings with GM and the provincial and federal government.

WATCH | GM is increasing production in Fort Wayne, Ind., as it cuts a shift in Oshawa:

GM increasing production in Indiana as it cuts hundreds of jobs in Oshawa

October 1Duration4:52General Motors has added 250 temporary jobs to its plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., as it prepares to cut hundreds of jobs in Oshawa in the new year. CBC's Christian D'Avino visited Fort Wayne to learn more about where these jobs are going.

But the mayor did say he thinks there is an opportunity for the Oshawa plant to make military vehicles, which it did during the Second World War.

We want to make a case that the workforce, the technology, the lines, the history is here, and we can meet whatever demands that they're looking for, Carter told CBC News.

Still, awarding a military contract would be less of a solution and more of a possible bone thrown to the plant, says Greg Layson, digital and mobile editor at Automotive News Canada.

You're never going to make 60,000 military vehicles a year the way you make 60,000 pick-ups per year, he says. But it's some work on some level at some factories in Ontario.

Could Oshawa become a hub for EVs?

The auto industry as a whole is transitioning toward electric vehicles (EVs), Anastakis says. Ideally, he says it would be great if GM were to retool the Oshawa plant to build EVs.

But, he says U.S. President Donald Trump's policies have hurt this transition towards EVs (new window), putting North American companies behind Chinese and European automakers. Chinese manufacturers are far and away the leaders in EVs, says Greig Mordue, an associate professor of engineering at McMaster University and former Toyota Canada executive.

The world is going electric, and Canada is at a hinge point, he says.

We can continue to coddle the Big Three [Ford, General Motors and Stellantis] that make about one vehicle in Canada for every two or three they sell, or we can embrace the new manufactures and take a more global outlook, Mordue says.

Canada placed a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles last year. The federal government has faced calls to lift these tariffs and is looking at the possibility of doing so (new window), despite concerns from Ontario Premier Doug Ford.

But Chinese EVs are more affordable than other EVs because most are made by state-backed automakers with cheap labour under questionable labour practices, Layson says.

Most of the factories are powered by coal fired power plants that generate electricity, he says.

Letting in Chinese-made EVs would also undercut the North American auto industry, as these automakers are trying to build out their own EV infrastructure and produce affordable EVs, Layson said.

You have to ask yourself if you are willing to cut the tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, at what cost? he said.

It's not just monetary. It's moral, it's ethical and it's environmental.","https://images.radio-canada.ca/q_auto,w_635/v1/ici-info/16x9/general-motors-third-shift-cut.png",N,,2025-10-03 17:02:33.230720

Now, the City Could Buy Out 'The Hole'",Samantha Maldonado,,,,,https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/10/03/flooding-homes-queens-brooklyn-buyout/,"With roads named for Amber, Sapphire, Ruby and Emerald, what some locals call the Jewel Streets area may be better known as The Hole.
Some homeowners like Julisa Rodriguez have been advocating for many years for the city to buy them out.
The environmental protection agency singled out the Jewel Streets area as one of 86 places in the city that need significant interventions because of stormwater flooding.
While the acquisition program is limited to the Jewel Streets area for now, it may expand to other flood-prone neighborhoods as funding becomes available.
The change is really happening for the Jewel Streets.”","For decades, residents of a neighborhood that straddles the border of Brooklyn and Queens have dealt with the unique effects of living in a basin: swampy flooding, bumpy streets, overgrown lots strewn with trash and leaky septic tanks — because homes are not connected to the city sewer system.

With roads named for Amber, Sapphire, Ruby and Emerald, what some locals call the Jewel Streets area may be better known as The Hole. It’s a neighborhood unlike any other.

And it is now unique in another way: It’s becoming the first place in the five boroughs where the New York City government will offer to buy flood-prone homes from homeowners — proactively, instead of in response to a disaster.

The Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice on Friday will begin collecting information from homeowners possibly interested in the city purchasing their property, including one- to four-unit homes and vacant lots.

For some locals, the possibility of selling their homes and no longer dealing with the conditions in the neighborhood comes as a relief.

“I’ve had enough,” said Bart Aclin, a retired Fire Department inspector who has owned his home there for nearly 25 years. “I’d rather just sell the property, if they give us fair market value, what they claim the property is worth. We’ll see.”

Under the shadow of leafy trees, Aclin’s home is at one of the lowest points in the neighborhood. He loves the quiet seclusion. He has an above-ground pool in the backyard, and he feeds four stray cats daily. But even on a dry autumn day this week, pumps continually moved water from his permanently soggy basement through a tangle of hoses into the overgrown lot next door.

“I don’t really want to leave, but it’s getting to that point,” Aclin said.

While homeowners can raise their hands for a possible offer from the city, there’s no guarantee it’ll come through. The city will consider if the property could fulfill a particular use in the context of new development and drainage upgrades in the neighborhood. For instance, the city could turn the land into park space or a community garden, put pumps or stormwater storage systems on it, or build new, flood-resilient housing.

The Resilient Acquisitions program, as the new effort is called, is intended to be “a resilience strategy that preserves as much housing as possible and ideally expands it by using properties that are acquired to defend other parts of their neighborhood,” said Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala.

Moving On

Acquiring property like the city is proposing in The Hole is a type of climate change adaptation known as managed retreat, where people, buildings and equipment move away from flood risks. But with the city’s housing crisis, taking places to live out of service is a thorny endeavor, and can have ripple effects throughout longstanding communities.

“We’ve designed a program that does really allow for us to have the targeted and necessary community conversation acquiring homes around flooding,” said Paul Lozito, deputy executive director of the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice.

After interested homeowners submit a form to the city, they can expect to get a call back in about two weeks’ time, he said. Then various agencies will talk to each other as well as to local individuals and community groups about uses for the land. Once the city decides what can be done with the property, homeowners can formally apply to sell their homes or lots.

Case managers will work with both property owners and tenants living in the buildings to help them move.

Making It Work

The Hole, sandwiched between East New York, Brooklyn, and Lindenwood, Queens, was built on top of marshland and has long dealt with neglect.

Even drizzles could cause standing puddles in the middle of streets, which attracted mosquitoes and made getting around difficult. Many homes aren’t hooked up to the city sewer system and rely on septic tanks, which also overflow when it rains. Floodwaters have at times seeped into or frozen gas lines, cutting off heat to homes.

Residents took matters into their own hands. They jerry-rigged a series of makeshift pumps to get water out of the street, and in some places, paved their own sidewalks. They invested tens of thousands of dollars in their homes to create protection from floods, and repair things when the water comes.

Some homeowners like Julisa Rodriguez have been advocating for many years for the city to buy them out. Now that that could happen, she’s both excited and a bit sad when she considers the uncertainty ahead.

“It’s a lot to think about. It’s really a lot,” she said. “I was surprised myself. I thought, ‘Aren’t you supposed to be happy, jumping through the roof?’”

Rodriguez said she’d have to figure out where to move, keeping in mind the schooling of her two kids, ages 5 and 10. On a recent sunny afternoon, they rode their bikes and played basketball in the front yard. Rodriguez called the area her oasis.

But she’s haunted by a memory from a decade ago of being pregnant with her son and the first floor flooding so badly she had to decamp to a hotel and then renovate. She said she recently got her house appraised and learned it was worth $1.3 million. How much the city can offer will determine her next steps, she said.

“I’m hoping that the city is fair and just. I think we do deserve it,” she said.

Floating Hope

The new program is designed to cope with not just coastal flooding — water comes from the ocean or bays during storms, which New York saw during Superstorm Sandy — but stormwater flooding, too, or what happens when the skies open up.

The environmental protection agency singled out the Jewel Streets area as one of 86 places in the city that need significant interventions because of stormwater flooding. And they came up with several ideas to fix it over the years.

The agency considered redoing the entire neighborhood’s sewer system, and connecting it to the rest of the city, but that would mean elevating streets up so high that they would bury the front doors of some homes. The city has also floated building a bluebelt — an engineered enhancement of a natural watershed to store and channel stormwaters — but would need more property to do so.

The city’s Housing Preservation and Development agency is working to create a neighborhood plan for the 12 blocks of the Jewel Streets area, as well as the surrounding, wider area that’s wedged between Conduit Avenue and Shore Parkway.

Along with other agencies — including the transportation and sanitation departments — the plan aims to better connect the streets, reduce flooding and develop new housing and open space. Already, agencies have cleaned up refuse that was dumped in some empty lots and began towing abandoned cars. The DEP in 2023 installed new storm sewers and catch basins, which residents said helped to cut down on the standing water.

While the acquisition program is limited to the Jewel Streets area for now, it may expand to other flood-prone neighborhoods as funding becomes available. The city will choose the areas based on where other strategies for preventing or protecting against flooding aren’t physically or financially feasible.

The Adams administration had proposed exploring an acquisition program for flood-prone properties in 2023 as part of the annual citywide sustainability report. That idea was built upon work from the de Blasio administration, which floated buying up properties soon after the floodwaters of 2021’s Hurricane Ida ravaged several low-lying neighborhoods. Some residents of repeatedly deluged homes in Hollis, Queens, asked the city for buyouts, but have never seen offers.

The government has bought out homes in flooded neighborhoods before, but all were done in response to Hurricane Sandy. And they were limited to certain coastal neighborhoods in Queens — including Edgemere on the Rockaway Peninsula — and in Staten Island, including in Midland Beach and Oakwood Beach.

That the Jewel Streets area would be the focus of the city’s first proactive buyout program was “awesome,” said Debra Ack, a member and co-founder of the East New York Community Land Trust, a community group that has been working with the residents since 2021 to push for improvements.

Ack was in a working group convened in 2023 to figure out how a buyout program could be part of the city’s strategy to become “rainproof,” and pushed for the neighborhood to be considered.

“This way you can condemn the land, make it undevelopable and put some nature back there,” Ack said. “It will still take time. At least we know it’s in the works, it’s doable now. The change is really happening for the Jewel Streets.”",https://www.thecity.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1E2A2371-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 16:02:06.681244

Ford and GM spokespeople confirmed the programs to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Ford Motor Co. and General Motors have developed a method through the IRS guidance to extend use of the electric vehicle tax credits, at least for leases, into the fourth quarter.

The Detroit automakers used their financing arms, called captive finance companies, to make down payments on EVs before finding customers, a move that allows those vehicles to qualify for the incentives beyond the Sept. 30 expiration.

Ford and GM spokespeople confirmed the programs to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Stellantis has not publicly announced a similar program. In a statement, the company said it “will continue to be aggressive in the marketplace to support our customers and future customers considering an electrified option.”

Tax credit eligibility applies to retail leases only, according to documents outlining Ford's program obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Electric vehicle purchases and fleet vehicles do not apply.

Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters at a media event Sept. 30 that the automaker worked to implement the program because he believes the EV owner base is important for the automaker's future.

“We don't want to have a hole in our owner base because we have a lot of customers that are driving our electric vehicles,” he said. “So I think there's a period of time when we'll have to transition consumers out of the government's support. But as far as how long we do that, and how deep we do it, you know, we'll see.”

GM's program is similarly structured to Ford's, according to a GM spokesman. When a customer leases an EV through the program, their payment reflects application of the tax credit and the finance company gets reimbursed.

Both Ford and GM offered dealers $1,000 per vehicle in dealer cash to participate, according to GM spokesman Jim Cain. The credit will be available as long as there is inventory covered by the program, the GM spokesman said.

In a statement, a Ford spokesperson said that through the program, the automaker “is working to provide Ford electric vehicle shoppers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31. “

President Donald Trump’s July legislation, called the Big Beautiful Bill, eliminated the President Joe Biden-era federal $7,500 tax credit on new EV sales and leases originating after Sept. 30.

The credit remained viable, the IRS said last month, if a vehicle is “placed in service” after Sept. 30, so long as a payment has been made on the vehicle.

“If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” per the guidance.

The IRS clarified a payment may include “a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in” and that the guidance applies to the federal commercial clean vehicle tax credit, which permitted automakers to pass on the $7,500 incentive to car buyers through a lease.

How it works:

Dealers opting in to the program received a $1,000 incentive per vehicle.

The automakers' financing arms selected vehicles with VIN numbers, meaning on participating dealer lots or in transit, and applied a payment toward them before the deadline. That payment is a percentage of the MSRP, but a spokesman would not provide specifics.

When the dealer actually writes the lease for the customer, the customer gets the value of the tax credit in the lease calculation.

The credit company gets paid back for its rebate, or down payment.

“The whole idea here is, it’s business as usual for the customer,” according to the GM spokesman. “Hypothetically, they can walk in on Oct. 1 or Oct. 31 and lease an EV and get the benefit of the credit if the dealer is participating in the program and still has inventory. It’s while supplies last.”

The GM spokesman also would not break out inventory, except to say, “We’ll be able to meet customer demand well into the fourth quarter.”

The move impacts some $550 million in already-approved grants for clean energy projects across the state of Colorado.

Today, U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper released the following statement after Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director and Project 2025 author Russell Vought announced the illegal cancellation of $8 billion of federal funding from the Department of Energy (DOE) to mostly Democrat-run states:

“The cancellation of this funding for political vengeance is blatantly illegal. Congress approved this funding to create jobs and to generate cleaner, cheaper power.

“Even if for some dark reason you are against cleaner energy, these projects are well underway. To abandon them now wastes the funds already invested, and needlessly cripples dozens of honest, hard-working small businesses that believed having a legal contract with our country meant something. The White House strategy during their shutdown is to punish Americans who dared to vote against them.”

The social media post by Office of Management and Budget’ (OMB) Manager Russell Vought was not just blunt, it was almost jubilant.

Calling development of clean energy initiatives a “green new scam funding the Left’s climate agenda,” Vought announced that his office had canceled grant funding across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Hawaii, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

Some 98 percent of the projects cancelled are in Democrat-run states. This is despite the fact that Republican-run states have secured over three-fourths of all BIL and IRA investments.

The funding illegally cancelled by Trump comes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and congressional appropriations. This funding has been contractually obligated, with contracts already signed between the Department of Energy and companies and universities, including in Colorado, for these projects.

According to industry data, good-paying, clean energy jobs are being created at three times the rate of job creation in other fields. Some 3.6 million Americans work in clean energy across 47 clean energy subsectors. So attacking it for what certainly appears to be ideological reasons does not make economic sense

Hickenlooper was pivotal in the negotiations and passage of both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a once-in-a-generation bipartisan investment in our nation’s infrastructure, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in climate rescue in the history of the world.

Clarifying his position regarding the republican moves to “punish’ Democratic-led states for their efforts to smash clean energy investment, Hickenlooper said he will always fight back against the Trump administration’s continued attacks on Congress’ power of the purse and investments for Colorado.",https://arkvalleyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4da610e2-6ed0-4481-a343-763d6b283762.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 16:01:53.914195

Trump Approves Intelligence Sharing with Ukraine

President Donald Trump approved the use of U.S. intelligence to help Ukraine carry out missile strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. According to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters, the move could extend to Kyiv’s request for long-range Tomahawk missiles. These weapons would target power stations, refineries, and pipelines—facilities that provide Moscow with revenue to fund its war.

Meta Builds AI Data Center in Rural Louisiana

In a Louisiana farming community of only 20,000 people, Meta is building a 4-million-square-foot artificial intelligence data center. While the project is expected to provide jobs and infrastructure investment, communities in Georgia have already reported water shortages linked to a similar facility that began construction in 2018. Locals now fear Louisiana could face the same environmental pressures.

Policy Changes: Wind, Coal, and Pipelines

The University of Maine canceled its annual floating offshore wind conference, citing changes in federal energy priorities.

New England’s last coal-burning plant, the Merrimack Station in New Hampshire, officially shut down after 65 years of operation, marking the end of coal in the region.

North Dakota’s attorney general stated the state cannot sue South Dakota over its eminent domain law for carbon pipeline projects.

A West Virginia fracking company is pushing Ohio regulators to allow drilling on 1,460 acres of state-protected wildlife area.

Global Energy Developments

The Israeli Navy intercepted the latest flotilla attempting to break the maritime blockade around the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and took Greta Thunberg and other activists into custody.

Footage from the scene on the Mediterranean shows the navy vessels intercepting the 47 boats that make up the Global Sumud Flotilla, which organizers say is carrying more than 500 activists, including climate advocate Thunberg.

Ukraine Strikes Push Russia Into Energy Crisis

Ukrainian drone and missile strikes on Russian refineries have crippled 16 of the country’s 38 refineries since August. The destruction has become so frequent that social media users have created “refinery bingo cards” to track the attacks. The strikes are creating a fuel crisis inside Russia.

Chernobyl and Nuclear Threats

Ukraine reported that its defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant lost power after shelling hit a nearby substation. Backup diesel generators are keeping the damaged reactor’s containment structure stable, according to the UN atomic watchdog.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned he could order strikes on Ukrainian nuclear facilities if Kyiv continues attacks on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhya plant.

Asian and European Energy Shifts

Taiwan imported $1.3 billion worth of Russian naphtha in the first half of 2025, despite sanctions and political opposition to Moscow’s war.

South Korea boosted nuclear generation by 8.7% in early 2025, nearly tripling its target growth.

France detained senior crew from a Russian “shadow fleet” oil tanker linked to sanctions violations and drone flights near Denmark.

The initiative from Schneider Electric includes firms like Microsoft, Zurich Resilience Solutions and Sunrock Distributed Generation. Now, along with Sustainability Partners, the groups are joining forces to support public and private sector organizations with innovative solutions and funding to strengthen energy systems that impact communities.

“Sustainability Partners is poised to play a crucial role in the success of Schneider Electric’s new Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative,” said Jason Hewitt, managing partner of infrastructure. “Our unique Infrastructure as a Service® model allows clean, reliable energy to be quickly and efficiently deployed to facilities as diverse as federal and state agencies, municipalities, airports, K-12 education facilities, police and fire stations, and hospitals.”

The objective of Schneider Electric’s Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative is to rapidly deploy resilient energy infrastructure for communities while federal incentives remain available. With the confluence of rising energy demand and aging infrastructure, along with extreme weather and potential cyber attacks, communities are facing unprecedented pressure to maintain power that is both affordable and reliable.

According to Schneider, the U.S. power grid could reach a critical inflection point in 2028, where peak electricity may no longer meet peak demand. Therefore, the Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative will reduce grid stress and energy costs by scaling distributed energy resources (DERs) like battery energy storage, solar panels and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. In this way, communities can reduce reliance on the centralized grid.

“With power outages costing the U.S. economy an estimated $150 billion each year, the need for resilient energy infrastructure has never been more urgent,” said Jana Gerber, North American president of microgrids for Schneider Electric. “This initiative brings together industry leaders to accelerate the deployment of local, future-ready energy solutions, helping communities reduce risk, control costs and ensure continuity of critical services.”

Sustainability Partners (SP) is a Public Benefit Company that facilitates funding, deployment, and ongoing care of essential infrastructure to help states, municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals meet their needs. SP can help solve any combination of funding, design, engineering, procurement, installation, and maintenance of essential infrastructure with no upfront costs.

Expanding our renewable-energy portfolio is more than an important step in securing a stronger Indiana; it’s a necessary one.","As someone who has spent much of my career working to bring opportunities to Indiana’s rural communities, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of renewable energy. The conversation about wind, solar and battery storage is more than sustainability and grid diversification. It’s about more than jobs, tax revenue and keeping Indiana competitive in a rapidly changing economy. The clean-energy conversation is about how we best serve our communities, our landowners and our people.

Here in Warren County, the Jordan Creek Wind Farm has been an incredible success for keeping our government well-funded so it can better serve our residents. The project put $6.7 million into the Jordan Creek fund over the last three years for our local government. This is increasing our local tax revenue, which is funding schools, road improvements and essential services without raising property taxes on residents. Warren County’s annual operating budget for 2025 is $12.2 million. It’s easy math to see the wind farm’s immediate impact, but it’s almost impossible to believe that an energy project could do so much for us.

Clean-energy projects start generating positive outcomes for their communities as soon as they start construction, and they continue to do so for years after they begin operation.

I look at the impact that the project is having on our local generational farm landowners. In today’s economy, a corn planter can cost more than a quarter of a million dollars, and an upgrade on that machine can cost almost $100,000. The confidence that comes from knowing that the annual payment from wind farms on a farmer’s property will help offset a significant portion of those costs is remarkable.

Clean energy has the power not only to keep farms viable but also to enable them to be more profitable and to survive the current depressed grain prices. The annual land lease payment income does more than just assist in affording farm equipment. Landowners don’t have to save for years just to take a trip to see their grandchildren. That’s all thanks to the checks coming in from energy projects on their land—checks that keep coming for years over the life of a lease agreement.

These projects mean new life for rural communities that have faced decades of population decline and shrinking tax bases. During construction, these projects create hundreds of jobs, from heavy equipment operators to electricians and engineers. The operations and maintenance roles they leave behind are well-paid, stable careers that don’t require leaving your hometown. In a state where too many young people feel they have had to move away to find good jobs, renewable energy is helping keep Hoosiers at home.

We all know farming isn’t for everyone, and these types of clean-energy careers offer new options, new opportunities and new futures for those who want to stay in Indiana but can’t find an alternative vocation that allows them to support their community.

The economic benefits extend far beyond the project site. Local restaurants feed construction crews, hardware stores see more sales, and hotels stay booked. Renewable-energy development has a ripple effect that touches nearly every corner of the community.

It is frustrating that despite all these benefits, Indiana’s ability to grow its renewable energy capacity is being held back by a patchwork of local siting rules that make it unnecessarily difficult to build. Every project must navigate a maze of differing ordinances, setbacks and permitting processes under rules that can vary widely from one county to the next.

This uncertainty drives up costs, delays construction and in some cases forces projects to break ground in other states. We need a smarter approach that respects local input but also establishes clear, consistent standards that make Indiana a welcoming place for renewable investment.

Expanding our renewable-energy portfolio is more than an important step in securing a stronger Indiana; it’s a necessary one. Indiana farmers have been supporting our communities, state and country for decades, and these wind and solar farms are now starting to return the favor. Energy development gives me hope that Indiana will be able to continue its agriculture heritage long into the future.•

“I’ve always been in energy because I think it’s just far and away the world’s most important industry,” Wright said at the forum, which included a panel discussion with business leaders and a fireside chat with MIT Professor Ernest Moniz, who was the U.S. secretary of energy from 2013 to 2017. Wright added: “Not only is it by far the world’s most important industry, because it enables all the others, but it’s also a booming time right now. … It is an awesomely exciting time to be in energy.”

Wright was greeted on campus by MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who also gave introductory remarks at the forum, held in MIT’s Samberg Center. While the Institute has added many research facilities and buildings since Wright was a student, Kornbluth observed, the core MIT ethos remains the same.

“MIT is still MIT,” Kornbluth said. “It’s a community that rewards merit, boldness, and scientific rigor. And it’s a magnet for people with a drive to solve hard problems that matter in the real world, an enthusiasm for working with industry, and an ethic of national service.”

When it comes to energy research, Kornbluth added, “MIT is developing transformational approaches to make American energy more secure, reliable, affordable, and clean — which in turn will strengthen both U.S. competitiveness and national security.”

At the event, Wright, the 17th U.S. secretary of energy, engaged in a fireside chat with Moniz, the 13th U.S. secretary of energy, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems Post-Tenure, a special advisor to the MIT president, and the founding director of the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI). Wright began his remarks by reflecting on Kornbluth’s description of the Institute.

“Merit, boldness, and scientific rigor,” Wright said. “That is MIT … to me. That hit me hard when I got here, and frankly, it’s a good part of the reason my life has gone the way it’s gone.”

On energy topics, Wright emphasized the need for continued innovation in energy across a range of technologies, including fusion, geothermal, and more, while advocating for the benefits of vigorous market-based progress. Before becoming secretary of energy, Wright most recently served as founder and CEO of Liberty Energy. He also was the founder of Pinnacle Technologies, among other enterprises. Wright was confirmed as secretary by the U.S. Senate in February.

Asked to name promising areas of technological development, Wright focused on three particular areas of interest. Citing artificial intelligence, he noted that the interest in it was “overwhelming,” with many possible applications. Regarding fusion energy, Wright said, “We are going to see meaningful breakthroughs.” And quantum computing, he added, was going to be a “game-changer” as well.

Wright also emphasized the value of federal support for fundamental research, including projects in the national laboratories the Department of Energy oversees.

“The 17 national labs we have in this country are absolute jewels. They are gems of this country,” Wright said. He later noted, “There are things, like this foundational research, that are just an essential part of our country and an essential part of our future.”

Moniz asked Wright a range of questions in the fireside chat, while adding his own perspective at times about the many issues connected to energy abundance globally.

“Climate, energy, security, equity, affordability, have to be recognized as one conversation, and not separate conversations,” Moniz said. “That’s what’s at stake in my view.”

Wright’s appearance was part of the Energy Freedom Tour developed by the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), in coordination with the Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University. Later stops are planned for Stanford University and Texas A&M University.

Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute, gave remarks at the forum as well, noting the importance of making students aware of the energy industry and helping to “get them excited about the impact this career can make.” She also praised MIT’s advances in the field, adding, “This is where so many ideas were born and executed that have allowed America to really thrive in this energy abundance in our country that we have [had] for so long.”

The forum also featured remarks from Roger Martella, chief corporate officer, chief sustainability officer, and head of government affairs at GE Vernova. In March, MIT and GE Vernova announced a new five-year joint program, the MIT-GE Vernova Energy and Climate Alliance, featuring research projects, education programs, and career opportunities for MIT students.

“That’s what we’re about, electrification as the lifeblood of prosperity,” Martella said, describing GE Vernova’s work. “When we’re here at MIT we feel like we’re living history every moment when we’re walking down the halls, because no institution has [contributed] to innovation and technology more, doing it every single day to advance prosperity for all people around the world.”

A panel discussion at the forum featured Wright speaking along with three MIT alumni who are active in the energy business: Carlos Araque ’01, SM ’02, CEO of Quaise Energy, a leading-edge firm in geothermal energy solutions; Bob Mumgaard SM ’15, PhD ’15, CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a leading fusion energy firm and an MIT spinout; and Milo Werner SM ’07, MBA ’07, a general partner at DCVC and expert in energy and climate investments. The panel was moderated by Chris Barnard, president of the ACC.

Mumgaard noted that Commonwealth Fusion Systems launched in 2018 with “an explicit mission, working with MIT still today, of putting fusion onto an industrial trajectory,” although there is “plenty left to do, still, at that intersection of science, technology, innovation, and business.”

Araque said he believes geothermal is “metric-by-metric” more powerful and profitable than many other forms of energy. “This is not a stop-gap,” he added. Quaise is currently developing its first power-plant-scale facility in the U.S.

Werner noted that the process of useful innovation only begins in the lab; making an advance commercially viable is the critical next step. The biggest impact “is not in the breakthrough,” she said. “It’s not in the discovery that you make in the lab. It’s actually once you’ve built a billion of them. That’s when you actually change the world.”

After the forum, Wright took a tour of multiple research centers on the MIT campus, including the MIT.nano facility, guided by Vladimir Bulović, faculty director of MIT.nano and the Fariborz Maseeh Chair in Emerging Technology.

At MIT.nano, Bulović showed Wright the Titan Krios G3i, a nearly room-size electron microscope that enables researchers to take a high-resolution look at the structure of tiny particles, with a variety of research applications. The tour also viewed one of MIT.nano’s cleanrooms, a shared fabrication facility used by both MIT researchers and users outside of MIT, including many in industry.

On a different note, in an MIT.nano hallway, Bulović showed Wright the One.MIT mosaics, which contain the names of all MIT students and employees past and present — well over 300,000 in all. First etched on a 6-inch wafer, the mosaics are a visual demonstration of the power of nanotechnology — and a searchable display, so Bulović located Wright’s name, which is printed near the chin of one of the figures on the MIT seal.

The tour ended in the basement of Building 10, in what is now the refurbished Grainger Energy Machine Facility, where Wright used to conduct research. After earning his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, Wright entered into graduate studies at MIT before leaving, as he recounted at the forum, to pursue business opportunities.

At the lab, Wright met with David Perreault, the Ford Foundation Professor of Engineering; and Steven Leeb, the Emanuel Landsman Professor, a specialist in power systems. A half-dozen MIT graduate students gave Wright demos of their research projects, all involving energy-generation innovations. Wright readily engaged with all the graduate students about the technologies and the parameters of the devices, and asked the students about their own careers.

Wright was accompanied on the lab tour by MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan, himself an expert in developing energy-efficient systems. Chandrakasan delivered closing remarks at the forum in the Samberg Center, noting MIT’s “strong partnership with the Department of Energy” and its “long and proud history of engaging industry.”

As such, Chandrakasan said, MIT has a “role as a resource in service of the nation, so please don’t hesitate to call on us.”",https://climate.mit.edu/sites/default/files/post-images/MIT-Energy%2520Secretary-01-press.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 16:03:50.221988

What Is The Market Telling Us

Vishay Intertechnology’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 1.7% on the news that the broader semiconductor sector rallied, lifted by growing optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and positive industry news. The positive mood was partly sparked by reports that Samsung Electronics passed Nvidia's qualification tests for its high-bandwidth memory chips, a key part for AI systems. This news helped boost the entire chip sector. The move was part of a larger trend where demand linked to AI has been lifting semiconductor stocks around the world, pushing several global stock indexes to new highs. Investors chased chipmaker stocks higher as the excitement around AI continued to build.

Not all vehicles are eligible for the discount, though, with the most notable absentee being the quad-motor version of the two EVs.

Besides the lease rebate, Rivian is also slashing $2,000 off the price of its All-Terrain package.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric cars is dead, but there are still some good deals to be had, as several automakers are coming up with ways to entice potential customers.

After Ford, General Motors and Hyundai, it’s Rivian’s turn to come up with something that could land it some additional buyers, albeit just by the end of this month. The American EV startup is offering a rebate of up to $6,500 for leases on certain models, but only if the customers take delivery of their new vehicles by October 31.

The biggest rebate of $6,500 applies to the 2025 R1S and R1T in three specific configurations: the tri-motor, the dual-motor with the Max battery pack and the Performance Upgrade, and the dual-motor with the Large battery and the Performance Upgrade. In other words, Rivian is trying to get rid of its inventory, but it’s worth noting that neither the entry-level Dual version with the Standard battery pack nor the top-spec Quad variant is eligible for any of these discounts.

That said, buyers can get $6,000 off the lease price of a 2026 R1S or R1T with the tri-motor configuration, while the 2026 R1S and R1T dual-motor with the Max battery and Performance Upgrade are eligible for a $5,000 lease bonus.

What’s more, Rivian is slashing $2,000 off the price of its All-Terrain Package if the customer takes delivery of a new 2025 R1S or R1T by October 31. The All-Terrain package is a paid optional extra that has a list price between $3,700 and $5,700. It comes with all-terrain tires, a spare tire, a reinforced underbody shield and extra driving modes.

To reiterate, these offers are only available for leases, not cash purchases, but it was the same story when the federal tax credit was still around. Due to their high price tags, the Rivian R1S and R1T were only eligible through leasing.

The most affordable model eligible for Rivian’s rebates is the Rivian R1T Dual with the Large battery and Performance Upgrade, which retails for $82,990 excluding the destination charge.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects.
Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state's hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES.
The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can't be justified.
Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican's short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.""

""I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state's hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project ""vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.""

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden's agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can't be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

""This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,'' said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, another environmental group, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also ""weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace'' for innovative energy technologies, he said.

When you apply BMW’s new $7,500 rebate, the offerings are enticing.","BMW is rolling out its own set of incentives just as the federal government recently pulled the plug on electric vehicle tax credits. For customers, it means the window to still secure significant savings on a new BMW EV hasn’t closed entirely. At the heart of the offer is a $7,500 rebate on BMW’s entire lineup of fully electric models. Buyers of the i4, iX, or i7 will see that amount taken directly off the MSRP, a figure that will feel familiar to anyone who followed the federal clean vehicle credit. In many ways, BMW is stepping in to replace what Washington has now taken away.

Things are more complicated for plug-in hybrids. The new 750e xDrive sedan qualifies for a $5,000 discount, but the deal doesn’t extend to the 550e or the X5 xDrive50e, both of which remain full-price despite their popularity.

How Does The Rebate Work

There are, of course, some strings attached. The rebate is only available on vehicles financed through BMW Financial Services, and customers who lease won’t see the benefit. Delivery also has to be completed by November 1, 2025, a deadline that puts added pressure on buyers to act quickly.

On top of the purchase rebates, BMW is also making financing more attractive. For October, the brand is offering 2.99% APR financing for up to 60 months on a selection of its electric models. The deal covers several versions of the i4, including the eDrive40, xDrive40, and the high-performance M50. It also extends to the i5 M60 and multiple trims of the i7, from the eDrive50 and eDrive60 to the flagship M70.

The timing is far from coincidental. For years, the federal government offered a tax credit of up to $7,500 for qualifying EV and plug-in hybrid purchases, though the rules were notoriously complex. Automakers lost eligibility after selling more than 200,000 qualifying units, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act added even more restrictions, tying eligibility to where a car was assembled, where its battery materials were sourced, and even placing caps on MSRP and buyer income. Those changes alone had already knocked some BMWs, like the German-built i4, off the list of eligible models. Then, in September 2025, the entire program was sunset altogether, leaving no new EVs or PHEVs eligible for the credit.

In that light, BMW’s new rebate isn’t just a discount—it’s a bridge. By offering the same $7,500 figure the federal government once provided, BMW is keeping its electric lineup competitive in a market where rivals are also scrambling to replace lost incentives with their own rebates and financing offers.

More Backing Behind EVs

It’s also a signal of where the company’s priorities lie. With the Neue Klasse EVs set to debut in 2026, BMW needs to maintain momentum and customer interest in its current generation of electric cars. Extending a lifeline to EV buyers helps soften the landing from the loss of federal support.

When you apply BMW’s new $7,500 rebate, the offerings are enticing. The i4 eDrive40, for instance, effectively drops to around $50,400 and the i5 eDrive40 to $67,100.",https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bmw-ix-charging-00.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:11.876434

Darling Ingredients Investment Narrative Recap

Shareholders in Darling Ingredients are typically focused on the company’s role as a key supplier to the renewable fuels and specialty ingredients markets, where policy change and demand trends are crucial drivers. The announced sale of US$125 million in production tax credits is a factor in Darling’s efforts to support near-term cash generation and debt reduction, but has minimal direct impact on the immediate regulatory risks and industry margin pressures that currently overshadow the biggest near-term catalysts.

Among the recent company updates, the agreement to sell production tax credits generated from the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture stands out, as it directly addresses Darling Ingredients’ high leverage. While proceeds from this deal could allow greater financial flexibility, near-term earnings and cash generation remain tied to broader regulatory developments and market pricing for renewable fuels.

However, with the volatility driven by regulatory and policy uncertainty around renewable fuel obligations, investors should be aware that…

Darling Ingredients' outlook anticipates $6.5 billion in revenue and $673.1 million in earnings by 2028. This scenario assumes 4.3% annual revenue growth and a $567.7 million increase in earnings from the current $105.4 million level.

, a 47% upside to its current price.

She put that on the table.” Hall was unconcerned about the possibility of a legal challenge to the tax increase.
The Department of Education will see a slight cut with $164.7 million ($62.5 million General Fund), a $228,400 cut from current year ($1.4 million General Fund).

In total, the state’s courts will see $383.6 million ($276 million General Fund), a 2.7% increase from this year.","The 2025-26 fiscal year budget was finally put to bed after midnight days after the official start of the fiscal year and months after a statutory deadline earlier this summer as legislative leaders worked mostly behind the scenes for much of the week.

Thursday’s session unfolded in the same way much of this week has, with lawmakers mostly waiting to take votes. At around 9:45 p.m. the House passed the general omnibus budget, HB 4706, but more action wasn’t taken until after 1 a.m.

Unfortunately, the invocation given in the Senate when the upper chamber gaveled back in after midnight on Friday – “Dear lord, please help us pass this budget; amen” – didn’t make a specific plea to a higher power for expediency. The Senate would eventually act on the budget bills a little after 1 a.m.

Although the Senate took action on HB 4706 and passed SB 166, the education omnibus budget, after 1 a.m., it didn’t take up the marijuana wholesale tax increase or the road funding bills until after 3 a.m.

When the amended road funding bills arrived in the House shortly after 4 a.m., carried by Senate Assistant Secretary Margaret O’Brian, the chamber erupted into applause. House members been waiting to take concurrence votes.

The snag which caught the Senate was approving budget implementation bills, particularly HB 4951, the 24% wholesale tax on marijuana. Around 2:30 a.m. House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, and Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, were both on the Senate floor whipping votes for the legislation. The Senate eventually passed the legislation as part of a long-term road funding plan (see separate story).

The House voted 101-8 on the general omnibus and 104-5 on the education budget. Both budgets cleared the Senate 31-5.

The bills are headed to the desk of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who remained mostly sequestered in her office between the House and Senate chambers throughout the night, periodically pulling groups of lawmakers in for meetings.

Whitmer thanked the legislative leaders and mentioned her signature campaign issue to “fix the damn roads,” is addressed through bills passed Thursday.

“I ran for office in large part because I wanted to fix the damn roads. Over the past seven years, we’ve made historic progress, fixing 24,500 lane miles and 1,900 bridges,” Whitmer said in a statement. “With this budget, we’re locking in a significant, bipartisan investment to fix state and local roads for decades to come, creating and protecting thousands of jobs in the process. I’m proud to deliver on my promise and look forward to driving on safer, smoother roads long after my time as governor.”

Farhat said that although the budget process was ugly, in the end, the Legislature got both the appropriations bills and their implementation bills across the finish line.

“What’s important is that we’re able to put aside partisan differences when we’re coming together in good faith,” he said. “There were many moments throughout this process it looked like … getting a budget that made sense for Michigan was out of reach, but I’m really proud that we were able to come together and get that done.”

Senate Democrats praised the spending proposals that moved through the Legislature Thursday. Details of both bills were revealed later Thursday before being unanimously adopted by conference committees.

“This budget shows that we can work together across party lines and deliver for the people of Michigan,” Sen. Sarah Anthony, D-Lansing, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. “This budget keeps people front and center by protecting health care access, investing in our schools, and making everyday life more affordable. It also proves that we can come together, even when it’s tough, to deliver a responsible, balanced plan that meets today’s needs and keeps our state moving forward.”

Hall said that much of the grind to get the budget across the finish line was due to negotiations over transparency on legislative earmarks.

“The reason the government shut down is because the Democrats didn’t want to do this,” he said. “We took it all the way up to the brink, and then they did it, and we’re going to make it a permanent law change.”

Passing transparency legislation will solve the problems the Legislature encountered in this year’s 10-month long budget process, Hall said.

“We’re going to disclose the pork spending,” he said. “Once…this stuff is disclosed earlier in the process, I think it’ll be a lot easier, because hopefully we won’t see as much opposition and obstruction to the transparency. That was the hardest part.”

Farhat, however, said the process was delayed because House Republicans didn’t introduce their budget proposal until the end of August.

“That is an issue when you’re trying to negotiate – not knowing the positions of the people on the other side of the table,” he said. “But when the moment it happened, we saw serious conversations ignited right away.”

Farhat said that the budget needed to be a less partisan process.

“We focus more on the issues that the working families and residents are asking us to focus on and less on political games,” he said. “I hope everyone has learned a couple very important lesson from this process and that we use those to prevent being where we are right now. Uncertainty isn’t good for Michigan.”

Hall said that the budget process showed that lawmakers should be having more conversations about what’s being spent rather than just what cuts to make.

“It’s just what are we cutting versus what was budgeted last year,” he said. “What I want to do next year is really dig into the actual spend numbers and make sure we’re cutting even deeper into those.”

The bill funding the state’s departments and agencies moved through the House easily around 9:45 p.m.

It includes $51.8 billion in gross funding for the state’s departments and agencies. Of that, $12.5 billion is General Fund.

It passed 101-8. Rep. Gregory Alexander, R; Carsonville; Rep. Timmy Beson, R-Bay City; Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers; Rep. Jim DeSana, R-Carleton; Rep. Phil Green, R-Watertown Township; Rep. Jaime Greene, R-Richmond; Rep. Brad Paquette, R-Niles; and Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City voted against the omnibus.

About four hours later and after passing several budget implementation bills from the Senate, the House passed SB 166, the bill authorizing funding for Michigan’s K-12 schools, community colleges, and higher education.

The bill passed 104-5. Carra, DeSana, Paquette, Wegela and Rep. Regina Weiss, D-Oak Park, voted no.

On the Senate side, Republicans Sen. Thomas Albert of Lowell, Sen. Joe Bellino of Monroe, Sen. Jonathan Lindsey of Coldwater, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township and Sen. Jim Runestad of White Lake voted no on both bills.

Hall said using School Aid Fund for community colleges and universities was important to sustaining higher education, though Democrats were uncomfortable with the shift.

“While we increase per pupil funding to a record high of $10,050, that number remains well below the national average of $17,700, and at the same time this budget shift hundreds of millions of dollars to higher ed dollars that could be allocated to do even more for our K-12 students,” Rep. Carol Glanville, D-Walker, said during a floor speech prior to the passage of SB 166.

The budget for universities relies on $850 million from the School Aid Fund, up from $461 million in the current year. Community colleges received $493 million from the School Aid Fund, which is in line with recent years.

Still, Glanville said the School Aid Fund budget provided funding for important priorities, such as universal school meals, the special education foundation allowance, increased funding for English language learners and transportation in rural districts.

“We’re giving our schools the flexibility they need at the local level to ensure that each individual child has the unique support they need to succeed,” she said. “We’ve landed on a student focused agreement that we can all be proud of.”

Rep. Tim Kelly, R-Saginaw Township touted the additional funding for school safety and mental health included in the School Aid Fund budget.

“These are real, tangible improvements for families,” he said during a floor speech.

Both chambers also passed several budget implementation bills during the marathon session.

Among them were HB 4180, HB 4181, HB 4182, and HB 4183, which make changes to the state’s fuel tax and redirect the funding to roads. The House concurred with the amendments made by the Senate early Friday morning.

The House passed bills modifying state fees and disbursement of funds including SB 579, SB 577, SB 574, and SB 578.

SB 579, the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, passed the House 104-5. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene, and Paquette voted no.

SB 577, water fees, passed 103-6. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene, Rep. Peter Herzberg, D-Westland, and Paquette voted no.

SB 574, tobacco settlement revenue, and SB 578, the Moveable Bridge Fund, passed 104-5. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene and Paquette voted no.

The House also passed SB 273, which would amend yearly fees pesticide distributors and fertilizer manufacturers and distributors pay the state. It passed 107-2, Carra and DeSana voted no.

Finally, the House passed SB 565, which amends the Michigan Trust Fund Act to lapse money in the Local Government Reimbursement Fund at the end of the fiscal year back into the General Fund. It passed 102-7. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene, Herzberg, and Rep. Veronica Paiz, D-Harper Woods; and Paquette voted no.

Lawmakers completed work early Friday morning on passing a slate of budget implementation bills that will set up a long-term state road funding plan, including the enactment of a controversial wholesale tax on cannabis products.

Senators voted 19-17 to pass HB 4951 which will enact a 24% wholesale tax on cannabis. The vote came after leadership spent much of Thursday and overnight into Friday morning working to round up the votes needed to get the key component of the road funding plan across the finish line.

The marijuana proposal drew sharp backlash from those in the cannabis industry, who showed up to the Capitol by the hundreds this week demanding lawmakers oppose the tax over concerns that it could upend the industry in Michigan and result in job losses.

Members also voted 22-14 for HB 49161, which will enable the state to “decouple” state and federal business taxes as well as HB 4968, which is an attempt to preserve some form of insurance provider tax.

Work on the road funding plan was completed with the passage of substitute versions of HB 4180, HB 4181, HB 4182, and HB 4183, which will implement a fuel tax swap.

Substitutes were adopted for HB 4180, HB 4181, HB 4182, and HB 4183 prior to final passage changing the start date for the gas tax swap to Jan. 1, 2026.

Exemptions for aviation fuel are removed under HB 4180 and HB 4182. Language providing a backfill for revenue lost to the School Aid Fund is included in HB 4180. All four bills were also tie-barred to SB 578, which deals with the Movable Bridge Fund.

The Senate voted 30-6 on HB 4180, 31-5 on HB 4181, and HB 4182, and 24-12 on HB 4183. The House later concurred in the Senate substitutes on all four bills, voting 102-7, 102-7, 101-8, and 98-11, respectively.

Three Republicans sided with the Democrats to pass HB 4961 and HB 4968: Sen. Mark Huizenga of Walker, Sen. Ed McBroom of Vulcan, and Sen. Michael Webber of Rochester Hills.

It was a bipartisan vote in support of HB 4951, with 15 Democrats being joined by four Republicans.

Democrats voting for HB 4951 were Sen. Sarah Anthony of Lansing; Sen. Rosemary Bayer of West Bloomfield; Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks of Grand Rapids; Sen. Darrin Camilleri of Trenton; Sen. Mary Cavangh of Redford Township; Sen. Stephanie Chang of Detroit; Sen. John Cherry of Flint; Sen. Erika Geiss of Taylor; Sen. Veronica Klinefelt of Eastpointe; Sen. Sean McCann of Kalamazoo; Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak; Sen. Jeremy Moss of Bloomfield Township; Sen. Dayna Polehanki of Livonia; Sen. Sam Singh of East Lansing and Sen. Paul Wojno of Warren.

Republicans supporting the bill were Sen. Kevin Daley of Lum, Sen. Dan Lauwers of Brockway, Sen. Ed McBroom of Vulcan and Sen. Roger Victory of Georgetown Township.

With this budget, Michigan will finally have a long-term road funding plan, House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, said.

“Republicans have been trying to do this sales tax swap since Jase Bolger, and we’re finally getting it done,” he said. “To dedicate all of the money collected at the pump to the roads, that’s a big deal. People understand that … that’s an important tax policy change.”

The 24% wholesale tax on marijuana was essential to the deal struck between the House, Senate, and the governor’s office for a budget deal and road funding, Hall said, and any of the heartburn the Senate had about voting for the increase was their own fault.

“Brinks provided options that she could do,” Hall said. “Democrats should have passed a roads plan, that would have made this a lot easier. By not doing that, they empowered Winnie Brinks to decide behind closed doors which revenue they could back. She put that on the table.”

Hall was unconcerned about the possibility of a legal challenge to the tax increase.

Cannabis was legalized in Michigan by a ballot proposal, and under Michigan law, a three-fourths majority is needed to amend an initiated act passed by voters. HB 4951, the bill implementing the tax and creating the Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act, fell short of that margin by five votes.

“When Brinks and the governor put this on the table, they did a legal review, and they came to the conclusion that you could do it this way,” he said.

In addition to road funding, House Democrats also touted record funding for transit.

“We’ve heard that for a long time now, that we need to fix the damn roads, and we did a great job of our state lines and our trunk lines, but we’re finally going to see money going straight to our neighborhood roads,” Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, said.

Rep. Jason Morgan, D-Ann Arbor, said the funding included for transit in the budget was a major win for Democrats.

The Transportation Funding Package agreed to for the final budget provides money for state trunkline roads and bridges, makes changes to the distribution formula in Act 51 for cities, villages and counties, provides money for rail grade separation, and local bus operations.

“This is going to be the largest investment in public transit, probably in my lifetime,” Morgan said. “This budget will include about $160 million a year for public transportation throughout our state … this is going to be transformational for Michigan.”

The debate over HB 4951 was more divisive.

Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, called the cannabis tax a terrible idea that will drive people to the black market and derail the marijuana industry in Michigan.

“This Legislature is trying to do an end-run around the will of the people and massively increase the tax on cannabis,” Irwin said. “This is going to drive Michigan customers out of the legal market. This is telling customers from other states ‘stop bringing your money to Michigan.’”

He said voters wanted the revenue from marijuana taxes to go not just to roads but to schools and local communities, adding the bill cuts out schools and communities.

McBroom spoke in support of the bill, saying he has seen communities in his district that have been swamped with marijuana businesses and a rise in crime.

“Where are the benefits?” McBroom said. “We have an industry that is out of control. It’s too large and it’s failing to deliver to the promises they gave to us when they said they come to our state.”

McBroom said he believed the tax may “do some right-sizing” of the marijuana industry.

Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, R-Coldwater, was also opposed to the proposal. He pointed to the effect it could have on small businesses and workers in the industry.

“I can understand the arguments about the practicality of the state believes that it needs more money, so we’ve got to tax something, and this seems like an easy target,” Lindsey said, adding he was disappointed in hearing comments this week from people wanting to hurt the industry.

Lindsey said he believed the bill would not accomplish its purpose to raise significant revenue for road funding.

Irwin was also opposed to the fuel tax swap package, saying it is not revenue neutral for those who drive electric vehicles and hybrids, spiking fees for both.

The bills would increase the fee for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to increase from $30 to $80, and for electric vehicles from $60 to $160.

“There is a huge problem in this package of legislation for K-12 schools and for our local governments,” Irwin added.

Irwin said local governments have raised concerns about the possibility of losing constitutional revenue sharing and not receiving the full funding that is lost from the Legislature.

Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township, said for years roughly $1 billion in revenue generated at the pump has gone to uses other than roads and that needs to end.

“It’s about time we take that promise to make sure every dime that hard-working taxpayers pay at the pump actually goes to fix our roads,” Nesbitt said.

Lawmakers unveiled the 2025-26 fiscal year budget and passed the proposal that balanced the House Republican priority that it include spending cuts and still provide key initiatives to keep the Democratic majority on board.

SB 166 and HB 4706 cleared both chambers on Thursday in votes that went into Friday morning after a protracted budget process that required a continuation spending bill to keep state government operating.

Boilerplate across the budget requires agencies to prioritize in-person work, but the Republican effort to prohibit diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives did not make the final version.

In total, the budget is about $75.9 billion with an additional $5 billion being held in contingency funds so not counted in the total. The General Fund is about $14 billion.

The education budget includes $24.12 billion ($1.56 billion General Fund) for K-12 schools, community colleges, and higher education.

“House Democrats have been clear from the beginning that our priorities in this budget were collective wins that would benefit all Michiganders, from students to patients to working families, and everyone in between,” House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri, D-Canton, said in a statement. “We delivered on those priorities tonight, and we’re going to keep delivering the wins that the people of this state need to thrive.”

The K-12 portion is $21.29 billion ($73.15 million General Fund), a 2.5% increase from the current year (7.2% General Fund). Per pupil funding will rise by 4.6% to $10.61 billion, or $10,050 per pupil.

Overall, the K-12 budget maintains the traditional structure outside of the per pupil grant with several categorical programs supplementing those funds for specific purposes. House Republicans had proposed rolling most of the funds together and boosting the per pupil grant much higher, though school districts opposed that concept.

“I’m proud that Senate Democrats held the line and worked across the aisle to successfully deliver another historic education budget that puts the real needs of students front and center,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said in a statement. “By securing the highest ever per-pupil funding, continuing the widely successful universal school meals program, and boosting literacy programs and at-risk funding, this bipartisan budget illustrates our unwavering commitment to Michigan students, educators, and schools.”

There are 25% increases for at-risk students and English language learners. There are 4.6% funding increases for intermediate school districts, career, and technical education and isolated districts.

Michigan Virtual University also gets a $1.8 million bump to $9.8 million.

The bill also includes a $100 million reduction in reimbursement to school districts for the Michigan Public School Employees Retirement System.

Education groups, however, noted the budget passed after the start of their fiscal years on July 1.

“No lawmaker should be celebrating or expecting gratitude for a budget passed more than three months beyond their legal obligation to get it done and with zero transparency to allow it to be reviewed until shortly before it was passed,” K-12 Alliance of Michigan Executive Director Robert McCann said in a statement.

For community colleges, there’s an overall 6.8% increase. The budget contains a 3% increase – labeled one-time only – for college operations using the performance funding formula. The overall operational increase is 2.1%. That translates to increases ranging from 1.5% to 3.2% among the 28 colleges. The rest of the increase comes from MPSERS related costs.

Total community college funding would be $493 million, all from the School Aid Fund. That is in line with recent history of School Aid paying for some or all of the community colleges budget.

Higher education will see a 0.5% increase, with a gross total of $2.34 billion ($1.48 billion General Fund). All of the state’s public universities will see increases to their state operational funding, but Michigan State University and the University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor flagship will see comparatively smaller increases of 2.1% each than their peers around the state.

The higher education budget relies on $850 million from the School Aid Fund, up from $461 million in the current year.

The large increases to some universities and large cuts to Michigan State University and the University of Michigan’s main campus in Ann Arbor that passed the House were scrapped.

A road funding proposal that included a marijuana tax increase and the removal of sales tax on fuel purchases was the key component to a nearly 16% increase in funding for the Department of Transportation.

Total fiscal year 2025-26 funding for MDOT will be $7.89 billion, an increase of 15.8% over the last fiscal year. Under the road funding package of $1.14 billion, counties will be allocated $456.7 million, cities and villages will see $246.1 million, and the remaining $179.7 million will be placed in the State Trunkline Fund.

Revenue sharing saw a $70 million pot for public safety for cities, villages, townships, and counties. Traditional revenue sharing was reduced or remained flat.

Constitutional revenue sharing under the new budget is set at $1.01 billion, a reduction of $63.6 million from the previous fiscal year.

Revenue sharing to cities, villages and townships would remain at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ($333.5 million), as would revenue sharing to counties ($291.1 million).

The conference also included $50 million in public safety revenue sharing grants and an additional $20 million in one-time grants for public safety.

House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, touted the cuts made the cuts made to the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, specifically around the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Strategic Outreach Attraction and Reserve Fund.

“We eliminated a lot of waste, fraud and abuse in the budget,” he said. “No new money for SOAR. … The wasteful grant programs, you saw cuts to the MEDC, and then what was important is we capped a lot of these one-time spends.”

LEO indeed faced some steep cuts, with a $690 million cut from the previous year. The budget topline stands at just over $1.7 billion for the coming fiscal year compared to last year’s $2.4 billion.

The incentives for business investment in the state received major cuts in the Business Attraction and Community Revitalization line item, with the conference calling for a $40.7 million reduction, removing all general fund funding, leaving the 21st Century Jobs Trust Fund with $59.3 million.

The Revitalization and Placemaking Program, which provided access for gap financing for infrastructure development and real estate rehabilitation, was removed in the sunset of the program’s funding source under a $50 million earmark from Corporate Income Tax revenue authorized first in 2022.

The Going Pro fund, used for employers to assist in training in the trades, also cut around $22.9 million of general fund dollars and shifted the remaining $22.3 million from ongoing to one-time. The House had originally called for removing all funds.

The budget also cut 53 of the 60 one-time programs from last year’s fiscal year, resulting in $633 million.

Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, said the Legislature should pivot its focus to economic development issues once the budget is wrapped up.

“I think that’s a very serious issue that we’ll look at later,” Farhat said.

The Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s budget shrinks by 6.9% to a total of $967.7 million ($170 million General Fund).

Major increases made were a $13.4 million one-time appropriation for lead service line removal and replacement and $34 million in one-time funding for grants and loans to support local government water infrastructure projects.

The conference also agreed to include a boilerplate item requiring EGLE to report the number of permit application appeals filed each fiscal year, as well as the number of applications approved within 30, 60, and 90 days, 6 months, and one year after an application is determined administratively complete.

The Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources will see a 7% decrease, with a total of $145.8 million gross ($77.5 million General Fund) to be spent. Significant decreases contributing to that 7% include an $800,000 decrease to emergency management baseline funding with no change in FTEs and a $500,000 reduction to ongoing funding for emerging contaminates in food and agriculture, a smaller reduction than the $1.6 million initially proposed by House Republicans.

The Department of Education will see a slight cut with $164.7 million ($62.5 million General Fund), a $228,400 cut from current year ($1.4 million General Fund).

Among the changes in the conference report, the bill would eliminate the $100,000 for the state poet laureate.

The Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential will see a 2.8% increase. The $662.2 million ($201.6 million General Fund) is $18.2 million higher than last year ($65.1 million General Fund). Much of the increase is due to Child Development and Care caseload costs.

The Department of Military and Veterans Affairs also would see an increase with $290.2 million ($128.2 million General Fund), which is $14.3 million higher than last year ($10.5 million General Fund).

Key in the Military budget is the $26 million for infrastructure upgrades at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base.

The Department of Insurance and Financial Services will see $79.4 million, a $785,000 increase. The department receives no General Fund dollars.

The final budget does provide funding toward the statewide management system being developed by the state’s judiciary. In total, the state’s courts will see $383.6 million ($276 million General Fund), a 2.7% increase from this year.

The statewide management system will see $1.8 million ongoing and $2 million one-time with no additional full-time equivalent positions.

The Department of Attorney General is taking a 2.6% cut overall, losing around $3 million. The overall budget stands at over $126 million. The House’s proposal sported a 30% deduction. There is a significant swapping out of General Fund money in exchange for restricted funds.

The Department of Civil Rights is looking at a $28 million budget with a $723,800 deduction from last year. One major cut was $1.5 million in general funds for museum support across the state, but the department did see an increase in information technology demands with an increase in $767,800.

The Executive Office received an increase of $272,100 with a $9.6 million budget. The increase was in economic adjustments for negotiated salary and wage increases for employees.

The Legislature also saw an increase of $172,500 with an overall budget of $200.8 million. The jump came from legislature operations.

The Legislative Auditor General received an overall budget of $31.7 million with an increase of $468,600 in general operations money.

The Department of Corrections budget totals $2.16 billion ($2.12 billion General Fund). That represents a 0.8% increase from last year’s budget.

Michigan’s congressional Democrats said during a press call Wednesday that the ongoing federal government shutdown could end if health care costs are addressed.

This is the 15th federal government shutdown since 1981, but the federal government has not faced a shutdown in the past seven years.

After not being able to vote on a budget deal Tuesday night, the U.S. Senate Democrats also blocked a Republican proposal to keep the government at existing funding levels through late November. The bill did not hit the 60-vote threshold with only 55 affirmative votes.

In a press call with the delegation on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, said this is a “Republican shutdown,” and the holdouts are about making things affordable for their constituents, focusing on the health care.

The White House released a statement Wednesday calling it a “Democrat Shutdown,” calling the hold out from Democrats “unserious” and “shameful political gamesmanship.”

One of the major hold outs is for the health care tax credit that expires at the end of December, which could substantially increase health care costs, according to Dingell.

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Bay City, said that until there is some relief on premiums doubling and rising costs in general, she is “a solid no vote.”

McDonald Rivet said that she hears Republicans saying they want to restore the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act tax credits and want to put it on the floor.

“If they actually believe that, if they actually want that, put it on the floor and we open the government tomorrow,” she said.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, said the delegation always feels like they’re in the “emergency department,” having to triage when federal funding is threatened.

“We all know right now there is a health care crisis, and I think people don’t realize that we have to move with the urgency,” Tlaib said. “We don’t have time when folks try to push that deadline. But we know for weeks Trump has refused to negotiate on the issues around health care.”

Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, said one couple in her district making $82,000 a year would face a 200% increase in premium costs from $700 to $1,700, which she said is “untenable” with housing and food costs. But she said, with the federal budget bill, there can be $700 per day tax handouts to the top 1%.

Some of the criticism from Republicans on the health care negotiations is that Democrats want to give health care through Medicaid to those living in the country illegally. Dingell said this is strictly a diversion from real budget talks and Tlaib said they been unable to share evidence to support their claims.

When it comes to weighing the implications of the shutdown versus the decision to not vote on the budget, Dingell said they are talking to the government workers affected by this, and while it was not a decision they took lightly, the delegation goes home every weekend and hears issues of affordability and health care, needing ultimately to protect that over delaying a shutdown.

Looking at the budget crises across D.C. and their home state, Dingell said one of the overlaps between the budgets is looking to support WIC and other food programs that may not have large allocations in the state budget, wanting to find federal funding for the increased demand on programs that are seeing fewer resources.

Dingell said 42% of the state budget is made up of federal dollars, and they have close working relationships with the state legislators in their district, knowing that the cuts are all connected, federal decisions impacting what will be in the state budget, creating more uncertainty.

Rep. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, directed the House’s chief administrative officer ahead of the shutdown that the House of Representatives withhold his pay if there was a lapse in appropriations.

“Members of Congress shouldn’t get paid while our federal employees and troops on the front lines go without,” Barrett said in a statement. “If Democrats shut down the government tonight, I’ll be withholding my pay until we get it back open for the American people. I voted with conviction to keep the government open. It’s time for Senate Democrats to put people before politics and do the same.”

The Michigan Strategic Fund Board approved projects Tuesday to bring an international automotive company’s regional headquarters to Wixom, provide millions for upgrades in water infrastructure and build housing development in Bay City.

Astemo Americas, Inc., a supplier of automotive systems, received a $2 million grant to bring a capital investment of $95 million to Wixom, combining their U.S. headquarters in Kentucky and technical center in Farmington Hills.

The company employs 320 employees in Michigan now, and this project would create 200 new jobs with more than 150 engineering and research and development positions, according to John Nunneley, senior vice president, design engineering and program management and general manager at Hitachi Astemo Americas.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer visited Astemo on her trip to Japan this past month. The project was announced by the company on Sept. 3 before approval.

Michelle Grinnell, chief communications and attraction officer for the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, told reporters before the meeting that while it is not their “typical timeline” for projects, there is some flexibility when the governor has investment missions before the board has finalized the project.

“There are just these unique moments occasionally that come up where we want to take advantage of having Michigan leadership and company leadership in a room together in market to be able to talk about why we are working together and why these investments are coming to Michigan,” Grinnell said.

A deal with JR Automation, an automated manufacturing company, was also announced earlier this month with Hitachi before board approval at the Tuesday meeting. JR Automation will receive a $1.6 million grant for consolidation of West Michigan operations in Zeeland, which will lead to a $72.8 million investment with 150 new jobs.

The company had been considering consolidation in South Carolina instead but decided to land in Michigan due to its existing workforce and the incentive assistance, according to the project brief.

The company also received a local property tax abatement of around $9.5 million and a State Education Tax Abatement around $2.3 million.

“This project will unify three of the company’s existing facilities in Western Michigan into a single global headquarters facility in Zeeland with space for headquarters functions, manufacturing and enough room to grow and even double its footprint in the future, if needed,” Amanda Eisbrenner, business development advisor at the MEDC, said. “Moreover, the company views the project as a talent attraction and customer acquisition tool, as it plans to develop a world-class facility with a showroom for robots, AI, cobot demos and more.”

American Rheinmetall, a defense manufacturer with headquarters in Sterling Heights, was approved for a $7.52 million grant as well as an expansion with a relocation to Auburn Hills, consolidating other metro Detroit facilities as it upscales its engineering capability to sign more U.S. Department of Defense contracts.

This would also create 450 new jobs across four facilities including Lapeer, Lansing, and Plymouth with $31.75 million in capital investment. The positions would pay on average $25 to $56 an hour.

The company received a grant before for expanding its Sterling Heights facility in 2022 but changed course in its consolidation effort. The MEDC disbursed some $980,000 of the $1.5 million grant and are in good standing as of July 2025.

“This project helps position us as really, a true national leader in the defense sector and continues to help us diversify into new forms of advanced mobility, R&D, and engineering, which is what our greatest capability is here across the Detroit region,” Justin Robinson, senior vice president of business development at the Detroit Regional Partnership said. “Additionally, these high-paying jobs help us continue to retain that skilled workforce that’s here, right? Our core industry of automotive is going through transition. These defense sector jobs present very similar opportunities based on their skills to retain and attract those folks that are being laid off.”

Outside of the business, the board also approved nearly $22 million water infrastructure grant funding for 12 communities including Albion, Allegan, Benton Township, Big Rapids, Evart, Grayling, Hartford, Houghton, Ironwood, Olivet, village of Baraga, and the village of Hillman.

The funding can go toward projects such as sanitary and storm sewer lines, water lines, wastewater treatment plants, and related activities around treatment plants. Bay City will also see a new housing development with an economic assistance loan for Riverview Apartments on the north end of downtown. The building will include 90 housing units and two commercial storefronts.

Shellene Thurston, economic development marketing manager for Bay City, said these apartments will be transformative.

“Not only does this revitalize our downtown by creating walkable community, but also supports this attainable workforce housing, all of which are included in our local master plan, which has just been recently updated to include a significant emphasis on housing,” Thurston said. “This activates a key site in a gateway to the northern section of our downtown and turns contaminated property into a productive community asset.”

NextEra Energy Capital Holdings Inc. received a bond in an amount not exceeding $175 million for funding a renewable natural gas facility in New Boston to convert landfill gas into clean natural gas. Jay Frazier, senior attorney at NextEra Energy, said the company is established and is expected to make its returns.

Construction on the facility is set to begin in June 2026 and begin commercial operation in June 2027. Internally, the MEDC requested an extension of the memorandum of understanding for seeking reimbursement for administrative expenses. This year, the MEDC just requested the specification of responsibilities in administering the 21st Century Jobs Trust Fund initiative and other programs.

Usually, the MEDC requests allocation of funds for this, but did not this year because of budget uncertainty. Matthew Casby, chief board relations officer and MSF fund manager, said once there is a budget, the MEDC will request allocation.

Other approvals included an extension for the deadline for funds to Side Door Michigan, a venture capital investment fund, which has been approved twice in the past, and a state tax capture for Bay Valley Resort.

Whitmer championed the investments and housing development.

“Michigan’s economy is open for business and on the move,” Whitmer said in a statement. “We’re revitalizing our communities, investing in our workforce, and building affordable housing. I’ll continue going everywhere and competing with anyone to tell Michigan’s story and show more individuals, families, and businesses how they can ‘make it’ in Michigan. Let’s keep growing our economy, unleashing our innovators, and making our state the best place to live, work and play.”

MEDC Chief Executive Officer Quentin Messer Jr. said in a statement that the MSF was committed to “executing the state’s ‘Make it in Michigan’ economic development strategy.”

“We continue to be grateful to have the legislatively appropriated funds to provide solutions for Michigan’s most-pressing barriers to growth and prosperity so that our 10 million+ friends, families, and future neighbors will have more reasons to realize their employment, entrepreneurial and housing dreams here in Michigan,” Messer said.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MI-capitol-flag.png,N,,2025-10-03 16:02:24.303352

EDF and EPE Cut the Ribbon on Solar+Storage Project Elsewhere in the southwest, EDF Power Solutions North America and El Paso Electric (EPE) recently announced the start of operations at the Milagro Solar+Storage project with a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
“Our state is blessed with abundant sunshine, making solar energy a natural fit for our economy and environment.
“The start of commercial operations at the Milagro Solar+Storage project marks a significant step for our region,” shared Dave Hawkins, Vice President of System Planning and Operations Support for El Paso Electric.
“This project is such a great example of the many ways energy storage strengthens the communities we partner with.","In what is either an all-timer of a coincidence or President Trump directing the U.S. government to harm his perceived enemies (again), the Department of Energy is pulling $7.6 billion in grants supporting 223 clean energy projects in 16 states – all of which voted for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in last year’s election.

According to the DOE, a review determined the projects did not “adequately advance the nation’s energy needs” or were not economically viable. We don’t know what is being cut yet, but the Natural Resources Defense Council anticipates losing some battery plants, hydrogen projects, carbon-capture endeavors, and perhaps most importantly, upgrades to the electric grid.

People living in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, assuredly already coping with rising electricity bills, will now be further harmed at the hand of a President who is out of touch with the modern energy paradigm and the place of renewables within it. The numbers don’t lie – despite all the roadblocks put up by the administration, solar and wind make up 90% of all new electricity capacity so far in 2025.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, moonlighting as the Grim Reaper in a bizarre AI-produced video pushed by Trump himself—a twisted homage to Blue Öyster Cult, seemingly celebrating the clawing back of federal funds—made no attempt to explain how the DOE came up with the list of targeted states.

ArcLight Announces $1B CPP Investment in AlphaGen

On Thursday, infrastructure investor ArcLight announced that Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) has entered into a definitive agreement to invest $1 billion for a strategic minority position in AlphaGen. AlphaGen boasts one of the largest independent power portfolios in the U.S., with more than 11 gigawatts (GW) of critical power assets located in strategic markets.

ArcLight and the AlphaGen portfolio are well-positioned to help deploy critical infrastructure that can provide capacity, reliability, and “time to power” this need in fast-growing markets like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other parts of the PJM Interconnection market. The investment is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

“As demand for electricity accelerates, these assets will play a vital role in balancing renewable growth with the need for reliable supply,” assessed Bill Rogers, Head of Sustainable Energies, CPP Investments. “Partnering with ArcLight, a highly experienced investor in power markets, positions us well to support AlphaGen’s strong operational performance to deliver sustainable, long-term value for the CPP Fund.”

Ampacity opens Distribution Center in Iowa to Support Power InFrastructure Projects

End-to-end structural and electrical solutions company Ampacity has announced that its new 300,000-square-foot distribution facility in Des Moines, Iowa, is fully operational. The warehouse is tailored to support construction firms, developers, and utilities building solar, wind, battery storage, and data center infrastructure projects across the United States.

It will serve as an operational hub, handling stocking, fulfillment, logistics, kitting, prefabrication, and material storage functions that keep large, complex projects running smoothly.

“It’s only been two years since we opened our Kentucky warehouse, and that facility is now running at full capacity. The industry is asking for more from us, and this new distribution center is a key part of our response,” explained Eben Russell, founder and President of Ampacity.

In addition to expanded handling and distribution capacity for Ampacity’s longstanding single-axis solar tracker business line, the Des Moines site houses the company’s largest-ever investments in handling and processing machinery for electrical goods. The warehouse features a three-to-one wire spooling line that simplifies cable installation by combining multiple reels into a single run. The team at the facility also performs custom cutting of medium-voltage cables and assembles modular kits that are pre-configured for specific phases of construction, helping reduce manual labor, limit installation errors, and enable customers to keep their projects moving with greater consistency and efficiency.

“We’ve gotten this facility off the ground fast. In this market, time is of the essence, and we’re already stocked with the wire and cable, termination kits, sectionalizing cabinets, and single-axis tracker material that our customers need to keep moving,” said Jeremy Haugen, Ampacity’s director of operations in Des Moines. “At this point, our focus is on scaling up the prefabrication and kitting work that we perform in the warehouse. Ampacity has a tradition of trusting people with years of experience in the field to create better ways of delivering goods. We’re bringing that spirit to Des Moines.”

CPS ENERGY Starts Operations on 2-hour Duration BESS

CPS Energy, the nation’s largest municipally owned electric and natural gas utility, has started operations at Padua 1, a 50-megawatt (MW), 2-hour duration battery energy storage system (BESS) in Bexar County, Texas.

Padua 1, owned and operated by Eolian, was part of an RFP seeking 50 MW of battery storage that the utility launched in 2020. CPS Energy entered into a storage capacity agreement for Padua 1 with Eolian in 2023. This project advances the utility’s Vision 2027 strategy, which emphasizes delivering reliable, resilient, and cleaner energy solutions to meet the needs of San Antonio’s growing population.

Padua 1 connects directly to the CPS Energy grid and is designed to charge during periods of excess electricity supply to provide capacity that would be readily available to deploy during the hours of highest system cost and needs. This added flexibility to both absorb and discharge electricity within seconds helps strengthen grid reliability, improves system operations during peak usage, and supports the integration of cleaner energy resources, especially during extreme weather and high energy demand days.

“Padua 1 is a major step forward for our utility and our community,” said Rudy D. Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy. “It’s the first energy storage project as part of our diverse generation plan to come online, and it sets the tone for what’s ahead. Battery storage strengthens our ability to continue to serve our customers reliably now and in the future.”

Once completed in early 2026, the Padua Grid battery energy storage complex, which will total 400 MW and nearly 2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) when completed in early 2026, will be the largest battery energy storage deployment in Texas when completed.

“Padua Grid was sited years ago at a critical substation adjacent to the JK Spruce and retiring Braunig power plants and was specifically designed to reduce overloads on key transmission lines serving San Antonio,” recalled Aaron Zubaty, CEO of Eolian. “Battery energy storage projects of this scale enable the efficient utilization of existing transmission resources and are the lowest-cost and fastest solution to meeting the nation’s strategic need to grow electricity production by allowing baseload power plants to operate better.”

The completion of Padua 1 follows CPS Energy’s 2024 announcement of agreements for an additional 350 MW of battery energy storage capacity, which includes Padua 2, a 150 MW 4-hour system, and Ferdinand, a 200 MW 4-hour system; both projects were also developed by Eolian. Padua 2, also located in Bexar County, is expected to be completed in Spring 2026.

EDF and EPE Cut the Ribbon on Solar+Storage Project

Elsewhere in the southwest, EDF Power Solutions North America and El Paso Electric (EPE) recently announced the start of operations at the Milagro Solar+Storage project with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The 150 MWdc solar photovoltaic project, combined with a 75 MWac/4-hour BESS, will supply electricity to EPE under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

Situated on private land in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, New Mexico, the Milagro Solar+Storage project enables EPE to manage evening energy ramps, mitigate curtailment, and stabilize its grid. The project created approximately 200 jobs during its peak construction phase, with 100 positions filled by New Mexico residents. Over Milagro’s operating lifespan, it is expected to generate around $18 million in tax revenue for Doña Ana County.

“For New Mexico, this project is especially meaningful,” said United States Senator Ben Ray Luján. “Our state is blessed with abundant sunshine, making solar energy a natural fit for our economy and environment. By pairing solar generation with advanced storage, you’re helping southern New Mexico communities gain more reliable access to power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and supporting our state’s climate goals.”

“Launching our first solar and storage project in New Mexico is an exciting milestone, and we look forward to supporting EPE as this project delivers long-term price stability, stimulates economic growth, and reduces emissions,” added Kate O’Hair, Senior Vice President of US Development for EDF Power Solutions.

“The start of commercial operations at the Milagro Solar+Storage project marks a significant step for our region,” shared Dave Hawkins, Vice President of System Planning and Operations Support for El Paso Electric. “It reflects our shared commitment to a cleaner, more resilient energy future – strengthening grid reliability and ensuring dependable service for our customers, even as energy demands evolve. We extend our sincere thanks to EDF Power Solutions for their leadership and partnership in bringing this transformative project to life.”

Lightshift Energy Microgrid Keeping Massachusetts Schools Powered During Outages

Virginia-based utility-scale battery energy storage provider Lightshift Energy, alongside the Wakefield Municipal Gas and Light Department (WMGLD) and the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company (MMWEC), recently celebrated the commercial operation of a 5 MW BESS that will power two Wakefield high schools and operate as a resilient, grid-connected microgrid.

Developed as part of WMGLD’s Energy Park Project, the battery system is designed primarily to reduce peak demand on the grid, which is expected to save local customers $20 million over the project’s lifetime. It will also provide backup power to Wakefield Memorial High School and Northeast Metropolitan Regional Vocational High School during outages.

The battery displaces the need for diesel backup generators and uses peak shaving revenue to support full electrification of both buildings, enabling clean and reliable heating and cooling year-round.

“Energy storage was our first choice when identifying a more cost-effective and renewable solution to power the schools, compared to diesel backup generators that would have cost $1.2 million per generator,” said Peter Dion, WMGLD’s General Manager. “We are incredibly grateful to have the entire town’s support to deploy the Lightshift battery that will provide cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable electricity to our schools.”

This is the third project in a broader Lightshift-MMWEC partnership to bring energy storage systems to many of the joint action agency’s member utilities. The MMWEC program is estimated to provide more than $200 million in energy savings for residents across Massachusetts. MMWEC is the Commonwealth’s designated joint action agency for municipal utilities in Massachusetts.

“This project is such a great example of the many ways energy storage strengthens the communities we partner with. We are bringing clean backup power to schools and supporting their electrification while also providing WMGLD customers with major, risk-free savings,” said Rory Jones, co-founder and Managing Partner of Lightshift Energy.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FT-Template-28.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:24.460707

That's why we're breaking down what a government shutdown means, how it could affect our families, why this matters in our fight to protect our environment, and what we can do now.
The Trump Shutdown is going to impact all of us.
From day one, Donald Trump has worked to dismantle the very protections for our air, water, and our public lands.
They are responsible for the harms this shutdown will cause our communities.","At midnight on Wednesday, October 1, Congress failed to reach a spending deal resulting in our federal government shutting down.

This shutdown is confusing and stressful to many of us. We rely on the federal government and the services it provides for our families, communities, businesses. That's why we're breaking down what a government shutdown means, how it could affect our families, why this matters in our fight to protect our environment, and what we can do now.

🤔 Why is this happening?

Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. Their gross mismanagement has led us here, with all of us suffering the consequences. Since day one, Trump has unraveled protections for clean air and safe drinking water, cut funding for clean energy initiatives that lower utility rates and costs for families, and fired or forced out hundreds of thousands of federal workers and civil servants.

In short, he has handed the keys to our government over to corrupt politicians, fossil fuel companies, and corporate polluters who paid to get him elected. Sadly, this shutdown is just the next illogical step in Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to dismantle our federal government.

Our democracy is very much at risk.

🤷🏽‍♀️ What does this mean for me?

The Trump Shutdown is going to impact all of us. Government workers deemed ""essential"" will be forced to work unpaid while others will get sent home. This will cause:

Social Security and other health and safety programs like nutritional assistance for families could see delays.

Air travel may become even more chaotic, dysfunctional, and potentially dangerous.

The FDA will likely reduce food inspections, while the EPA will suspend enforcement at hazardous waste sites, drinking water and chemical facilities that are breaking clean air and water laws.

Thousands of disaster relief workers, like those at FEMA, will face significant challenges due to funding shortages and delays in aid; many are expected to be furloughed.

🚨 What is at stake?

Because of Trump and Republicans, Americans are already paying through the roof for everyday necessities. Utility bills alone have gone up 10 percent in a matter of months. This shutdown will send prices for electricity, groceries, health care and more even higher.

National parks and other public lands are being forced to remain open, but with skeleton staffing, which will seriously harm these lands, wildlife, and nearby communities. What's more, federal disaster relief and aid programs, which are critical to protect and assist our communities even during ""normal"" circumstances, will be stretched by Trump's government shutdown, affecting long-term rebuilding efforts and leaving communities vulnerable if a major emergency occurs.

From day one, Donald Trump has worked to dismantle the very protections for our air, water, and our public lands. He’s gutted federal agencies, like the Department of the Interior, with layoffs and hiring freezes, leaving rangers and staff stretched thin.

Now, Trump and Republicans in Congress are holding our government hostage because they want to raise energy and healthcare costs to benefit their billionaire friends.

✋ How does it end?

Every day, Sierra Club works to protect people and the planet. To do that, we need a functioning democracy. Each Trump attack—from firing agency staff, to threatening local governments, to shutting down our government—pushes us further into an authoritarian future that I'm sure none of us want.

Right now, Democrats are working to protect our healthcare and lower costs, while Republicans are choosing to shut down the government. Trump and Congressional Republicans control every branch of the federal government. They are responsible for the harms this shutdown will cause our communities.

Trump and Republicans need to come to the table and negotiate with Democrats for a deal that doesn't escalate our healthcare emergency and other crises.

We all want this shutdown to be over as soon as possible, and we can't back down and trade our health, democracy, and future for their authoritarian demands.

🫵 What can we do?

Right now, the most important thing is to make sure the people in our communities understand what is at stake and who is to blame for this shutdown.

Trump is actively using illegal actions to punish his enemies, curtail freedom of speech and the media, and consolidate power. The overreach of the administration and ignoring the rule of law places all Americans at risk and makes it more difficult to fight for our environment and future.

We need a functioning democracy to secure protections for the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the climate we rely on. We have real power right now.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members wrote.

According to Sen. Young, in June, the EPA proposed record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in its Set 2 proposal and included a 50% reduction in RINs for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks. He says this is the import RIN reduction.

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA’s policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

In addition to Senator Young, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin signed the letter. Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives, including Representatives Erin Houchin and Mark Messmer, also signed the letter. Other Tri-State representatives who signed it include Rep. James Comer and Rep. Mike Bost.

The news came from UAW Local 14 President Tony Totty, who confirmed that the decision was made last week and said no jobs will be affected.

“General Motors previously revised production plans at Toledo Propulsion to support additional capacity of ICE propulsion units in alignment with current market demand and manufacturing flexibility,” GM told WTOL in a statement.

The original plan was for Toledo Propulsion Systems, previously called Toledo Transmission, to be retooled to produce electric drive units for EVs. Back in 2022, GM announced a $760 million investment in the Toledo facility for this purpose, which would’ve made it the first GM U.S. powertrain facility retooled specifically for EV components. However, despite the hefty investment, no EV drive units have been produced for retail vehicles at the site.

The “previously revised production plans” the GM spokesperson mentioned refer to the automaker’s decision earlier this year to increase transmission production at the Toledo plant. The Toledo facility plays a critical role in supporting GM’s light-duty truck production, including vehicles assembled in Fort Wayne, Indiana. With tariffs motivating General Motors to build more trucks in the U.S., those trucks need domestically built transmissions, and Toledo is building them.

The Toledo Propulsion Systems facility will also likely be a source of powertrain components for the Lake Orion assembly plant, which will soon be retooled to produce full-size trucks and SUVs. Lake Orion is another example of GM reversing course on its original EV plans.

The terminated awards were issued by six offices, including those for clean energy demonstrations, energy efficiency and renewable energy, grid deployment, manufacturing and energy supply chains, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and fossil energy.

Recently, DOE planned to return more than $13 billion that had been approved under the Biden administration to incentivize the development of renewable energy projects.

The DOE stated that the decision follows a detailed, individualized financial review to assess the economic and strategic value of projects funded through its various offices.

It added that the canceled projects did not adequately advance national energy needs, were not economically viable, and failed to demonstrate a positive return on investment.

Of the 321 awards, 26% were issued between November 6, 2024 (Election Day), and January 20, 2025 (Inauguration Day), a period DOE noted was marked by a rush of funding approvals. These awards alone were valued at more than $3.1 billion.

Chris Wright, the Secretary of Energy, stated that one of the department’s priorities was to review billions of dollars in financial awards, many of which were issued during the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation.

Wright said the cancellations reflect the current president, Donald Trump’s, directive to protect taxpayer resources while ensuring the expansion of affordable, reliable, and secure energy supplies in the U.S.

In May this year, Wright issued a memorandum titled “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance,” which established new guidelines for evaluating financial awards across the department.

The policy requires program offices to conduct case-by-case reviews of awards, request additional information from awardees when necessary, and assess projects against standards of economic viability, national security, and energy security. The new policy also prioritizes the safeguarding of taxpayer dollars while “advancing the administration’s commitment to affordable and reliable domestic energy.”

The DOE confirmed that, based on this evaluation framework, each of the 321 terminated awards was found to be inconsistent with its revised standards. As part of the process, award recipients have been granted 30 days to appeal the termination decision. The department noted that some of the affected projects have already initiated appeals.

In July, Trump signed an executive order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to terminate the clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities and implement the enhanced foreign entity of concern restrictions identified in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Act.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-10-03T161714.723.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 17:01:54.834244

The assessment claims to analyze the environmental impacts of the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s amendment request to change the route, pipe diameter and capacity of the project.
Indeed, FERC’s Environmental Analysis today concluded that the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project proposed by Transco could technically, practically and economically eliminate the need for the proposed Southgate project.
With the release of the assessment, FERC has announced a 30-day comment period, closing on Nov. 3, with no public hearings for residents along the route.
“Southgate necessitates a full application, not an insufficient amendment request and environmental assessment,“ said Jessica Sims, Virginia Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released an Environmental Assessment for the methane gas pipeline Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate, proposed for Virginia and North Carolina. The assessment claims to analyze the environmental impacts of the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s amendment request to change the route, pipe diameter and capacity of the project. Southgate would extend the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline from Pittsylvania County, Virginia, into Rockingham, North Carolina, and has faced significant opposition since it was originally proposed in 2018.

Project opponents contend a new application should be required, instead of an amendment, because the route, size and impact of this version of the project are different from the project for which FERC issued the original 2020 Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.

Adding to the significant concern about Southgate, the Williams Companies’ expansion of their Transco pipelines, called the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, is undergoing a simultaneous permitting process, with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality undergoing a Clean Water 401 permit review through Nov. 10, and FERC expected to release an Environmental Assessment of the project in early November. The pipelines companies have bickered publicly about their access to the area and the need for both pipelines. Indeed, FERC’s Environmental Analysis today concluded that the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project proposed by Transco could technically, practically and economically eliminate the need for the proposed Southgate project. The co-location of two high-pressure, large diameter pipelines is of significant concern for local residents.

With the release of the assessment, FERC has announced a 30-day comment period, closing on Nov. 3, with no public hearings for residents along the route. The lack of hearings and the limited comment period hinder meaningful public participation from those along the impacted route.

“Southgate necessitates a full application, not an insufficient amendment request and environmental assessment,“ said Jessica Sims, Virginia Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices. “Southgate’s developers inflicted harm on all communities within the path of their violation-riddled Mountain Valley Pipeline mainline, and should not be granted more permission to extend that harm into North Carolina.”

“During MVP Mainline construction, the pipeline’s developers were charged millions in fines for hundreds of violations,” said Dr. Crystal Cavalier-Keck, Co-Founder of 7 Directions of Service. “MVP's proposed extension of its pipeline into North Carolina — MVP Southgate — is now within half a mile of another dangerous proposed pipeline, Transco SSEP, and the burden on our communities will only be compounded. We deserve to be heard: FERC should extend the public comment period and reject MVP Southgate once and for all.”

“North Carolinians have never wanted Southgate,” said Caroline Hansley, Campaign Organizing Strategist with the Sierra Club. “The only ones who are pushing for this pipeline are the MVP developers who will make billions from polluting our communities’ air and water while harming our health. FERC must deny this amendment and protect our communities.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-03 14:02:49.033735

President Donald Trump, shortly after taking office in January, rescinded Biden’s memorandum withdrawing those waters from leasing and has since reopened the eastern Gulf of Mexico and other coastal waters to fossil fuels development. Cain in May ruled the case wasn’t moot despite Trump reversing Biden’s withdrawals.

Cain ruled Thursday that Biden, and President Barack Obama before him, exceeded presidential authority when they withdrew large swaths of Outer Continental Shelf lands without an expiration date.

Higher natural gas generation drove the slight increase in CO2 emissions, and a 3% increase in total nitrogen oxides (NOx). Total sulfur dioxide (SO2) decreased by 8%, according to the 2024 ISO New England Electric Generator Air Emissions Report.

The analysis, which draws information from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) databases and other sources, found that New England’s current power system emissions are well below those observed in the early 2000s and 2010s. Carbon dioxide emissions declined 20% between 2015 and 2024.

Report takeaways

Similar seasonal patterns between 2023 and 2024 kept year-over-year changes in carbon emissions relatively small.

Both 2023 and 2024 were characterized by mild winters and summers with few periods of tight system conditions. New England wholesale electricity demand was just 2% higher in 2024 than the historically low demand of the previous year. The region often relies on higher-emitting oil- and coal-fired generation to meet increased demand for cooling on very hot days, or to make up for natural gas pipeline constraints that can occur in very cold weather. These resources typically drive emissions higher.

Drought and extended nuclear outages in Canada contributed to a reduction in imports.

Ongoing drought in Québec, affecting hydropower, and an extended outage of nuclear resources in New Brunswick from April to December 2024 drove an overall reduction in Canadian imports. This contributed to an 8% increase in natural gas production year over year.

Increase in renewables continues, while nuclear returned to more normal operations.

Over the last 10 years, wind and solar generation in the region has more than doubled, making up 7% of the total energy generated in 2024. Wind and solar generation have now effectively replaced most coal and oil generation. Coal and oil generated just 0.5% of the total energy in 2024, compared to 3.6% in 2015. Nuclear, another key non-emitting resource type, returned to normal operations in 2024 after multiple planned refueling outages in 2023.

Emission rates for CO2, SO2, and NOx, which describe how many pounds of each pollutant are given off for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced, have seen double-digit declines over the past decade, dropping 20%, 82%, and 42% respectively. Emission rates were flat or down from 2023 to 2024.

By the numbers

The table below summarizes annual average emissions and emission rates for 2024, as well as the year-over-year changes from 2023. The table includes figures for emissions from New England generation, as well as data on emissions associated with New England generation plus electricity imported from other regions. More detailed results can be found in the report’s appendix.

About the data

Town Board members will now take the deep dive into reviews for Terra-Gen’s proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion battery energy storage system on 12 of the 15 acres at the 430 Hurley Ave. site of the former John A. Coleman Catholic High School, which is across the road from the recently updated Central Hudson substation, and 337 feet from the Kingston city line and 0.32 miles from the town of Hurley.

The Town Board extended the public comment period during a Thursday, Oct. 2, meeting that included a promise by a Terra-Gen attorney that the positive declaration would not be met with a lawsuit.

“If the board decides to issue a positive declaration, we support that decision,” Terra-Gen attorney Robert Panasci said.

“We are confident in our application and confident that the comprehensive environmental studies that we’ve provided and the additional studies and information we can provide will lead to a full environmental review.”

Board members made the approval conditional on getting a letter with the promise that a state Environmental Quality Review Act positive declaration, which says the project is likely to have detrimental impacts, would not result in a court challenge. That requirement was met before the meeting was completed.

“Please be advised that (Terra-Gen subsidiary) Alcazar ESS, LLC will not commence litigation due to the fact that the Town Board is issuing a positive declaration under SEQRA,” Panasci wrote.

Under the now-expanded environmental review, there will be an information gathering period that will take in every concern that can be generated by the public in all potentially affected areas. Those concerns will go to the developer for responses, with the board then able to either draft a scoping document for action that is needed to be in a draft environmental impact statement, or declare that the response was incomplete because the developer did not provide enough information.

Among immediate concerns cited by the Town Board based on the application are:

• Potential impacts on threatened and endangered species, including proximity to a known northern long-eared bat hibernaculum within 3.5 miles of the site. That would require the developer to adjust its tree-clearing schedule.

• Possible historic and cultural impacts due to the former John A. Coleman Catholic High School being over 50 years old.

• Having a large-scale industrial energy facility immediately adjacent to residential neighborhoods.

• Potential visual, noise, and stormwater impacts that include grading, drainage and operational noise.

• Concern over public safety and emergency response capabilities to handle fire suppression and hazardous materials.

Town officials expect to meet with planning consultants to develop a timeline for when public sessions will be conducted and the period which comments can be submitted.",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DFN-L-052225-coleman-06-rotated.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-10-03 16:03:44.123336

The U.S. Supreme Court will be deciding a number of cases during the new nine-month session that begins Monday. These include issues like presidential powers, trade tariffs, transgender sportspeople, guns, race laws, campaign finance laws, gay ""conversion therapies"", religious rights, and capital punishment. The following are some of the cases that will be heard during the upcoming court term. Separately, the court has also acted in emergency cases involving challenges against President Donald Trump's policy. TRUMP TARIFFS A court has agreed that it will decide on the legality Trump's global tariffs. This is a major test for one of Trump's most bold assertions of executive authority, which has been at the heart of his economic and trading agenda. The Justice Department appealed the lower court ruling that Trump had overstepped his power in imposing his tariffs, which were imposed under a federal emergency law. This case could result in trillions of dollars worth of customs duties within the next decade. The lower court ruled Trump had overreached by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act in order to impose tariffs. This ruling was made in response to challenges from five small businesses as well as 12 U.S. States. A toy manufacturer will also be bringing a separate case. Arguments will be held on November 5. TRUMP'S FIRE OF FED OFFICIAL Justices will hear arguments about Trump's bid to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This is the first time a president has attempted to fire a Fed Official, as he questions the independence of the central bank. The court refused to decide immediately on a Justice Department's request to put a judge’s order temporarily blocking Trump from removing Cook. Congress created the Fed in 1913 and passed the Federal Reserve Act, which included provisions that shielded the central bank against political interference. The law required governors to only be removed ""for cause"" by the president, though it did not define this term or establish procedures for removal. The arguments are set for January but the exact date is not yet known. FIRE OF THE FEDERAL COMMISSION The Justices will hear arguments about Trump's firing a Democratic member from the Federal Trade Commission. This is a significant test of presidential authority over government agencies that Congress intended to be independent. The court allowed Trump to remove Rebecca Slaughter while the case is still pending. Slaughter filed a lawsuit after she was dismissed from the Consumer Protection and Antitrust Agency before her term expired in 2029. This case offers the court the chance to overrule an important precedent that dates back 90 years, upholding job-protection measures put in place by Congress for federal agency heads to have some independence from the presidential control. The judge rejected the argument of the administration that tenure protections illegally infringe on presidential powers. The arguments are set for December but the exact date is not yet known. TRANSGENDER SPORTS PARTICIPATION The court will hear Idaho and West Virginia's bid to enforce state laws that ban transgender athletes in female sports teams within public schools. This is another civil rights challenge against Republican-backed restrictions for transgender individuals. Idaho and West Virginia appealed lower court decisions siding with transgender plaintiffs. Plaintiffs argued the laws discriminate based upon sex or transgender status, in violation of U.S. Constitution 14th Amendment equal protection guarantee and Title IX civil right statute which prohibits sex discrimination in schools. The arguments have not been scheduled. The Justices agreed to hear the challenge of a Christian counselor on free speech grounds against a Democratic-backed Colorado Law banning ""conversion therapies"" that are intended to change a child's sexual orientation. The counselor appealed the lower court's ruling that rejected her claim that a 2019 Colorado statute violated the First Amendment by censoring her communications with her clients. The state claims it regulates professional conduct and not speech. According to court documents, the counselor is a Christian who believes that people ""flourish when they live in accordance with God's plan, including their biological gender."" Arguments will be held on October 7. HAWAII GUNS LAW The court took up the challenge of a Hawaii gun law that restricts the carrying handguns in public places, such as businesses. This gave the court the opportunity to expand gun rights. Three Hawaii residents who hold concealed carry licenses, and a gun rights group based in Honolulu appealed the lower court's ruling that Hawaii's measure is likely to comply with the U.S. Constitution Second Amendment right of keep and bear arms. Hawaii's concealed carry law requires that licensees obtain the owner's permission before bringing their handguns onto public property. The arguments have not been scheduled. CAMPAIGN FUNDING The court agreed to hear the Republican-led challenge, on free speech grounds, to a federal campaign finance provision that limits spending by parties in coordination and cooperation with candidates for office. This case involved Vice President JDVance. Vance and two Republican committees, both of whom were running for U.S. Senate at the time the litigation started, appealed the ruling by a lower court that limited the amount of money political parties could spend on campaigns, with the input of candidates they supported. The question is whether the federal restrictions on coordinated campaign expenditures violate First Amendment protections against government abridgment. The arguments have not been scheduled. LOUISIANA ELECTORAL DISTRECTS The court will again hear arguments in a dispute involving a Louisiana election map that increased the number of U.S. Congress districts with a majority of Black people in the state. The court will be assessing the legality a key element of the 1965 Voting Right Act that was meant to prevent racial bias in voting. Justices heard arguments on March 24, but ordered on June 27 that the matter be debated again. State officials and civil right groups appealed an earlier court ruling which found that the map of Louisiana's six U.S. House of Representatives district - now with two Black majority districts instead of one - was in violation of the Constitution's equal protection promise. Arguments will be held on October 15. CRISIS PREGNANCY COUNTER The court will examine whether to revive a New Jersey operator of a crisis pregnancy center's attempt to stop the Democratic-led attorney general's investigation into whether the Christian faith based organization misled women into thinking it offered abortions. First Choice Women's Resource Centers has appealed the ruling of a lower court that said the organization had to contest the attorney general's summons in state court first before filing a federal suit. The crisis pregnancy centers offer services to pregnant woman with the aim of preventing abortions. They do not promote their anti-abortion views. First Choice argues that it has the right to take its case to federal court, because it alleges a violation of First Amendment rights for free speech and freedom of association. The arguments have not been scheduled. EXXON CLAIMS CUBA COMPENSATION Justices will hear ExxonMobil’s bid to get compensation from Cuban state owned firms for oil assets seized by Cuban communists in 1960. The law allows Americans to sue foreign companies or individuals over confiscated property. Exxon appealed the ruling of a lower court that undermined its legal efforts to obtain compensation from Cuban companies who allegedly profited by stolen property. The lawsuit invoked a 1996 U.S. Law called Helms-Burton Act. The court also heard a similar request by a Delaware registered company that had built port facilities at Havana that were seized by Cuba in 1960. It wanted to reinstate $440 million of judgments against Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, and two other cruise companies that used the terminal. The arguments have not been scheduled. RASTAFARIAN INMATES The justices heard a Rastafarian's case to sue Louisiana prison officials for shaven him bald and holding him down in violation of religious beliefs. Damon Landor's religion dictates that he let his hair grow. He appealed the lower court decision to dismiss his lawsuit filed under a U.S. statute protecting against religious infringements by local and state governments. Landor was not allowed to sue officials individually for damages under this law, according to the lower court. The law in question protects religious rights for people who are confined in institutions like prisons and jails. The arguments are scheduled for 10 November. DEATH ROW INMATES The court will hear the appeal of Alabama officials against a ruling that an intellectually-disabled man who was convicted of murder in 1997, but spared from death penalty. They are pressing ahead with their bid to execute the Republican-governed State. According to the lower court's analysis of Joseph Clifton Smith's IQ scores and expert testimony, he was deemed intellectually disabled. According to a Supreme Court decision from 2002, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unjust punishment is violated by executing a person with intellectual disabilities. The arguments are scheduled for 4 November. COX COMMUNICATIONS PIRACY VERDICT Justices heard a dispute over copyright between Cox Communications, a music label group and the court after a judge threw out an $1 billion jury verdict that had been pronounced against Cox Communications for alleged music piracy by Cox's customers. Cox Communications appealed the lower court decision that it would still be liable for any copyright violations by its customers despite the ruling overturning the verdict. Sony Music, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group are among the labels. The arguments have not been scheduled. CHEVRON AND XXON COASTAL POLLLUTION The court agreed to hear an application by Chevron and Exxon Mobil, as well as other oil and gas firms to move lawsuits filed by two Louisiana municipalities accusing them of damaging the state's coastline over a decade-long period to federal court. The companies appealed the lower court's decision rejecting their claim that the lawsuits should be heard in federal court, because the parishes Plaquemines & Cameron were suing for oil production undertaken during World War Two to fulfill U.S. Government refinery contracts. Federal court is regarded as a more friendly venue for such litigation. Arguments have not been scheduled.

Hotels are a major factor in countries' decision to skip the COP30 climate conference

Hundreds of hotel rooms are in short supply, and prices have risen to hundreds of dollars a night. Two European nations have said that they are considering not attending Belem at all. The organisers of COP30 are racing to convert cruise ships, love motels and churches into accommodations for the 45,000 expected delegates. Brazil held the climate talks in Belem because it has an average of 18,000 hotel rooms available. It hoped that its location at the edge the Amazon rainforest, would draw attention to the threats climate change poses to the ecosystem and its role as a sink for climate warming emissions. LATVIA SAYS THAT ROOMS ARE EXPENSIVE The Latvian climate minister said that the country had asked its negotiators if they could dial in via video call. Melnis stated, ""We've already decided that it is too expensive for us."" It's the very first time that it is so expensive. ""We have a duty to the budget of our country."" Lithuania, a second country in eastern Europe, has also indicated that it will not be staying after receiving quotes for prices exceeding $500 per person, per night. A Lithuanian energy minister spokesperson, who covers climate issues, stated that the quality and legitimacy of negotiations would be affected if governments were unable to attend due to the cost. According to a spokesperson for Brazil's COP30 Presidency, the decision is up to each country. COP30 HOTEL PRICE LEAVES DELEGATES OUT OF POCKET The website displayed rates ranging from $360 to 4,400 per night, just days after Brazil launched a booking platform at the beginning of August. The platform displayed prices starting at $150 per night this week. The host country rejected calls to move the summit, saying it would provide 15 hotel rooms at a price of less than $220 per night for each delegation from a developing country and below $600 per night for any wealthy delegation. The United Nations also increased their subsidy for low-income countries to attend. According to Brazil's Presidency of COP30, less than six weeks before COP30, there are still 81 countries in negotiations about hotel rooms, while 87 have already reserved accommodation. Evans Njewa is the chair of the Least Developed Countries Group, which represents the poorest countries in the U.N. Climate Talks. He said that the group was still assessing the attendance plans. Njewa said: ""We receive a large volume of concerns... and many requests for assistance."" ""Unfortunately, our capacity is restricted, which could affect the size and composition of delegations."" CLIMATE ACTION UNDER THREATEN The COP summit this year takes place as the U.S. president Donald Trump seeks to shift America's focus away from climate change and Europe's priorities are changing due to its struggling economies. Ilana Seid said that the lack of affordable housing placed her members at ""a severe disadvantage"". The small island states have taken advantage of previous COPs in order to get more funding for climate change adaptation. Seid stated that smaller delegations would not allow island nations to ""participate effectively in the negotiations that decide our future"" because they lack the expertise required.

Exxon's compensation claim to Cuban entities will be heard by the US Supreme Court

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear ExxonMobil’s request for compensation from Cuban state owned firms. These assets were seized by Cuban government-owned companies in 1960. This was done under a federal statute that allows Americans to sue foreign individuals and companies over confiscated property. The Justices heard Exxon's appeal against a lower-court ruling that undermined its legal efforts to obtain compensation from Cuban companies who allegedly profited by stealing property. The court also heard a similar request by a Delaware registered company that had built port facilities in Havana that were seized by Cuba in 1960. It sought to reinstate $440 million of judgments against Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, and two other cruise companies that used the terminal. On Monday, the Supreme Court will begin its new nine-month session. Exxon's dispute is about the former Cuban leader Fidel Cuba's confiscation all its oil and natural gas assets in Cuba. This loss, valued at over $700 million now, was caused by Castro. Cuba has not paid Exxon any compensation, but the Helms-Burton Act gives the oil company the opportunity to sue in a U.S. Court for damages. Helms-Burton Act gives U.S. citizens who own property in Cuba the right to sue any person who ""traffics property that was confiscated by Cuban government on or after 1 January 1959."" The Helms-Burton Act also allows the U.S. President to suspend this provision if it is deemed necessary to ""protect the national interest of the United States."" Exxon sued three Cuban state owned companies in 2019 for compensation, claiming that they continue to profit from their stolen property. These Cuban state-owned firms are Corporacion Cimex S.A., S.A., (Cuba), Corporacion Cimex S.A., (Panama), and Union Cuba-Petroleo. The litigation lasted for years, focusing on jurisdictional issues rather than liability. The U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, concluded that plaintiffs bringing Helms-Burton Act cases must satisfy an exemption under a separate U.S. law: the Foreign Sovereign immunity Act. This act shields foreign governments against lawsuits in the United States unless there is an exception. Havana Docks Corporation, in the cruise line dispute, sued four cruise lines in Florida federal court in 2019. Havana Docks constructed piers in the port before the Cuban Revolution, which took place in the 1950s. It is now seeking compensation from cruise operators for using the property between 2016 and 2019. Fidel Castro, Cuba's leader, nationalized and expropriated U.S. property shortly after he came to power in 1959. This included Havana Docks which held a concession granted by Cuba in 1934 for a 99-year period of construction and operation at the Havana port. Cuba has not paid compensation to Havana Docks. However, the Helms-Burton Act gives the company the opportunity to sue in U.S. courts for damages. A federal judge ruled the cruise lines were guilty of trafficking for docking their ships at the terminal. Each of the four companies was fined more than $100,000,000. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Atlanta, threw out these judgments last year. It found that Havana Docks did not have a viable claim because its concession would have expired in 2004, well before the cruise lines used the facilities. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Atlanta, threw these judgments out last year. It found that Havana Docks had no claim since its concession expired in 2004, long before cruise ships used the facilities. Both parties of the U.S. presidency chose to suspend the law. This meant that private lawsuits were not allowed to proceed. In 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, he lifted the suspension. This triggered a new wave of lawsuits in U.S. courtrooms against Cuban state owned entities and some American companies accused of trafficking confiscated property.",https://energynews.oedigital.com/img/energy-news-sqr.svg,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:14.487324

The Energy Department announced late Wednesday it was cutting awards that funded 223 projects, axing about $7.56 billion in spending.

In a social media post ahead of the announcement, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the funding cuts would take place for projects in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought, in his post, categorized the projects as “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

All of those states went for former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s election, and most of them have Democratic governors.

However, a breakdown released by congressional Democrats indicates some of the canceled funds are for projects located in states that did not vote for Harris: Tennessee, South Carolina, North Dakota, Iowa and Florida.

The funding being canceled was slated to go to a variety of recipients. One particularly notable award is up to $1.2 billion that would go to advance hydrogen energy in California.

That money was awarded as one of several regional “hubs” funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to promote energy that comes from hydrogen atoms.

“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned. Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), a likely 2028 presidential candidate, in a written statement. A press release from his office said the move threatens 200,000 jobs.

A major $1 billion in funding for hydrogen power in the Pacific Northwest was also canceled, but other hydrogen hubs in states including West Virginia and Pennsylvania appear to be untouched.

The cancellations come amid a government shutdown in which partisan tensions are particularly high. The Trump administration has been seeking to pressure Democrats to pass a bill to fund the government, including by threatening to fire federal workers. Meanwhile, Democrats are insisting on passing legislation aimed at bringing down healthcare costs along with any funding bill.

Among the companies losing funding are utilities such as Commonwealth Edison, Xcel Energy, Exelon, General Electric and Pacific Gas and Electric. Also losing out are companies that produce solar energy, electric vehicles and hydrogen power — among others.

In addition, funding is being canceled for the Gas Technology Institute, which has said it received significant government funding with the aim of reducing methane emissions from oil and gas production.

Sen. Martin Heinrich (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called the Trump moves “nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful” in a written statement.

“These are projects that Congress already approved and funded — projects that create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward. Instead of working to help our families and communities, the Trump Administration is tearing these projects down, driving up energy bills for families, and putting hardworking people in New Mexico and across the country out of work,” Heinrich said.

The Energy Department said in its press release that the 321 awards which would have gone to the 223 projects were being canceled after a “thorough, individualized financial review.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Congress in May that previously-funded projects were being reviewed on a variety of criteria, including whether they align with the Trump administration’s agenda.

Now, Wright said in a written statement that the cancellations came as part of an effort to “protect taxpayer dollars.”

The department said that 26 percent of the awards it was cancelling were issued by the Biden administration between the election and President Trump’s inauguration – and that these awards alone were worth more than $3.1 billion.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks.

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA’s policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

Raising the alarm is Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, who didn’t mince words: without that financial cushion, EV demand could plunge and sales may even be cut in half. Words are not soft this time, they shouldn’t be. In other words, the much-celebrated “electric boom” may fizzle into a dull pop.

Speaking at Ford’s “Pro Accelerate” event in Detroit, Farley painted a scenario that feels more like a rewind than progress: electric vehicles could represent just 5% of the US car market, the same level seen back in 2022. That’s a sharp contrast to the optimistic 10–12% market share forecasted for this month.

The message is blunt. The sector may not just slow down but actually shrink, becoming “smaller, much smaller,” as Farley put it. The reasons? Not only the disappearance of the credit but also shifting emissions policies that make long-term planning a logistical headache.

For Ford, this translates into a giant question mark. How do you make use of factories and battery plants built for a demand that’s suddenly shaky?

This is what environmental justice — the idea that all people, regardless of race, gender, or income, have the right to the same environmental protections — aims to rectify.
“This is the first time that we've had a policy that we're going to put in place for environmental justice,” said Liat Meitzenheimer, the president of Fresh Air Vallejo.
“The people need to be informed [about environmental justice] to be able to make good decisions,” Diaz said.","VALLEJO – Vallejo is one step closer to incorporating environmental justice into its general plan — a comprehensive, long-term blueprint that guides how the city will grow and develop until 2040.

The new effort was announced Wednesday evening at an event hosted by the environmental justice organization Fresh Air Vallejo at the Norman C. King South Vallejo Community Center. The project, dubbed “EJ4Vallejo,” is a partnership with the city that will involve scheduling community meetings, brainstorming solutions, and collecting stories and data so that the needs of the community are reflected in any future land use projects and climate resiliency strategies.

The project will run until winter 2026. “The ultimate impact, we hope, is a more empowered community that’s capable of influencing city planning,” said Lorene Allio, a member of Fresh Air Vallejo.

This is all part of the city falling into compliance with California Senate Bill 1000, which went into effect in 2018. SB 1000 requires that local governments engage with the community to identify “disadvantaged communities,” which are areas that experience compounding health risks due to pollution exposure and issues like food insecurity, unsafe homes, and inequitable access to resources. The law also requires that local governments promote civic engagement so that these affected communities have input into future policy decisions.

The California Environmental Protection Agency has a tool that maps out these areas. The data shows that people of color, particularly Latino and Black people, disproportionately bear the burden of living in high pollution areas. The most impacted neighborhoods are 91% people of color, while the least impacted neighborhoods are 67% white.

The disparity is a result of decades of redlining and systemic racism, with communities of color often pushed to live by freeways or refineries. This is what environmental justice — the idea that all people, regardless of race, gender, or income, have the right to the same environmental protections — aims to rectify.

“This is the first time that we've had a policy that we're going to put in place for environmental justice,” said Liat Meitzenheimer, the president of Fresh Air Vallejo. “We want the city to improve, but we want all of the city to improve, not just certain locations.”

Meitzenheimer pointed out that the meeting was held in South Vallejo, which has inordinately high rates of asthma. According to the data agency the Population Reference Bureau, Solano County has the highest rate of childhood asthma in the state. And South Vallejo had nearly triple the rate of asthma emergency room visits compared to the state average in 2023, per the California Department of Public Health.

“You can't be in school and learn if you can't breathe,” Meitzenheimer said. “So it's important for us to identify the areas of the city and look ahead into the future and plan so we can mitigate some of these problems and make the quality of life better for all citizens.”

Louis Michael, the project coordinator for Fresh Air Vallejo and a public health student at Touro University, said these issues hit home for him because his wife grew up in South Vallejo and she has asthma, and now he has two kids here.

“Real people are being impacted by these issues,” Michael said. “It really is something I care about a lot because I want to create a community and a city that is addressing these issues so that in the future, my kids, and their kids, and my great grandkids, don't have to worry about going outside because the air that they're breathing is polluted.”

The event was attended by Councilmember Helen-Marie “Cookie” Gordon, as well as city long-range planning manager Hector Rojas. There were also several local organizations in attendance that have partnered with Fresh Air Vallejo to engage and inform the community.

One of those organizations was Diaz & Loera Centro Latino, founded by former City Councilmember Mina Diaz. As a longtime activist, Diaz was immediately interested in the initiative, and said it’s important to include the voices of immigrant and Latino communities, as well as youth. To that end, she advocated for having two Spanish translators at the event for the main presentation; the slides also had both English and Spanish text.

“The people need to be informed [about environmental justice] to be able to make good decisions,” Diaz said. “We need to have this information out in different languages because if a child gets sick, it doesn't discriminate by what race they are.”

Ken Szutu, the founder of the Vallejo Citizen Air Monitoring Network, was there to showcase one of their outdoor sensors, which measures how much particulate matter is in the air, like dust and smoke. Szutu said there are more than 25 sensors positioned around Vallejo, and they connect to the PurpleAir app, which residents can then use to check air quality.

There was also the NAACP Vallejo chapter in attendance. Patricia Hunter, the president of the Vallejo branch, explained that their organization will also be hosting meetings in partnership with this initiative.

Hunter said it’s important to have “trusted messengers” within the community to share information about issues like environmental justice. She said it’s especially important to educate the youth about these issues.

“That’s what we’re here to do, educate and advocate,” Hunter said.

That ethos was echoed by the Center for Urban Excellence, which empowers systems-impacted youth through art, wellness, and workforce development programs. Their organization is not only involved with getting youth engaged in conversations around environmental justice, but also in helping them see the possibility for a greener future.

“We know that green energy jobs, and jobs that focus on sustainability, are the future of not only Solano County and Vallejo, but really the nation,” said Reina Robinson, the CEO of the Center for Urban Excellence. “So we have shifted a lot of our career pathways and our focus is on helping people find those kinds of forward thinking careers.”

Robinson added that the “EJ4Vallejo” project resonates because she grew up with asthma as well. She said there were many times that she fell asleep as a kid and woke up in the hospital because her mom said she couldn’t breathe. “That happened more times than I could count,” she said.

She said that many of the families they serve often feel “voiceless” when it comes to issues as simple as asking their landlords to change out the air filters in the apartment so that they can breathe better.

“The messed up part of it is that as people of color, as poor people, we often know we’re going to get the worst of it because we don't have that political power,” Robinson said.

The “EJ4Vallejo” project is hoping to change that. “For the community to be healthy, we have to have both clear information and clear policy that really reflects the community experience and the community voice,” Allio said. “That's the basics.”",https://www.vallejosun.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/environmentaljusticemap_ejvallejo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:02:08.231262

Attorneys general in Wyoming, Montana and 14 other conservative states are alleging big-name tech companies are misleading consumers about their support for green energy.

In a letter to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft dated Sept. 24, the attorneys general accused them of using “environmental accounting gimmicks” to say they’re powered by renewables.

“These claims appear deceptive given the increasing electricity demands of those companies and the realities of the U.S. electrical grid,” the letter says, before requesting the companies answer a series of questions about their energy use, policies and claims.

The state officials specifically criticize how the tech companies buy clean energy.

“The attorney generals are questioning the longstanding way we’ve done things,” said John Rogers, associate director of energy analytics at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Rogers said companies don’t always have control over where utilities get power. So, they may buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) from solar or wind farms to be more green and offset their energy use.

The attorneys general said companies don’t actually use that energy, and this doesn’t make them “powered by” renewables. A spokesperson from Amazon said this reliance on RECs is temporary.

“Amazon purchases RECs as a temporary bridging mechanism while we wait for renewable energy projects to come online,” the spokesperson wrote via email.

Rogers said buying RECs fuels more demand for renewables.

“You can be forcing action elsewhere in the market,” he explained.

The attorneys general also claim the tech companies are pushing utilities toward “harmful net-zero goals,” and this has led to coal and gas plants shutting their doors.

“These utility commitments have helped contribute to the phenomenon of early retirement of coal and natural gas plants, which is raising state concerns and threatening the integrity of the electric grid,” the letter reads.

The attorneys general also say that this threatens President Donald Trump’s efforts to “unleash American energy.”

Rogers said these points may suggest the state officials have ulterior motives.

“Their interest may not be entirely about ensuring the integrity of renewable energy markets and more about propping up fossil fuels,” he said.

The letter asks companies to respond to Montana’s Officer of Consumer Protection by Oct. 27.

The spokesperson from Amazon said the company has received the letter and is reviewing it. A representative for Microsoft said no comment. Google and Meta did not respond by deadline.

INDIANAPOLIS — Attorney General Todd Rokita and Indiana Department of Environmental Management Commissioner Clint Woods are championing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to repeal climate regulations for cars and trucks that they say hurt Hoosiers and the economy. The regulations, which cost Americans $54 billion annually, rest on the Obama EPA’s 2009 decision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Rokita said the regulations restrict Hoosiers’ ability to access affordable, reliable vehicles and hurt Indiana’s small businesses in the manufacturing and industrial industries.

“These rules are a bureaucratic power grab that burdens hardworking Hoosiers and families with unaffordable regulations,” Rokita said. “By scrapping it, the EPA would be restoring common sense, the rule of law and American energy independence. We fully support the rollback to restore polices that put our country back on the path to prosperity and protect Hoosier workers.”

The letter, submitted last week, argues the Obama EPA misused a statute that Congress designed in the 1960s and 1970s to tackle local problems like smog, not global warming. Recent Supreme Court decisions have been that EPA cannot regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases based on “speculative concerns about their indirect effects on the environment,” the news release said.

Rokita said the rule’s science is shaky, relying on outdated predictions that overstate CO2’s impact.

As Indiana’s lead environmental regulator, Woods emphasized IDEM’s success in balancing air quality gains with economic growth.

“The U.S. EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding and its resulting greenhouse gas regulations exceed the agency’s limited authority under the Clean Air Act and suffer from significant scientific, procedural and legal defects,” said Woods. “Given Indiana’s primary responsibility for air pollution control, its proven track record of improving air quality, and its bottom-up success in reducing greenhouse gases without federal overreach, IDEM strongly supports reconsidering these heavy-handed standards that impose costs on Hoosiers without delivering measurable environmental benefits.”

""That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here,"" he added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.

McNeill said the same thing would happen in the US, given how popular EVs have become in the country. Motor Intelligence, an auto data firm, said in January that EV and hybrid vehicles made up 20% of new car and truck sales in the US last year.

""The market's established, and we're probably ready to have a market that can grow without subsidies,"" McNeill said on Thursday.

""We are offering lower-priced EVs, which is definitely having a positive impact on this market growing,"" he added.

McNeill did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

In July, Congress passed President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which eliminated federal EV incentives. This included a $7,500 consumer tax credit for new EVs and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for used EVs. Both schemes expired on September 30.

The ruling does not, however, insulate the Agency from future challenges, particularly if it denies or delays petitions seeking new biosolids regulations.","Overview

On September 29, 2025, the US District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a lawsuit brought by Texas farmers, multi-state environmental organizations, and Johnson County, Texas that alleged the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA or the Agency) failure to regulate polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in sewage sludge used as fertilizer (biosolids) violates federal law, leaving communities vulnerable to ""forever chemicals"" in agricultural products and water supplies. The case, Farmer v. EPA, was originally filed in 2024 after farmers claimed their property, livestock, and health were harmed when PFAS-laden biosolids from neighboring fields migrated onto their land. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief compelling EPA to identify specific PFAS in biosolids as pollutants and regulate them under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

The Complaint

The plaintiffs alleged that EPA had shirked non-discretionary duties under the CWA by failing to identify 18 PFAS chemicals (Table 1 PFAS) as pollutants in its most recent biennial biosolids review and by failing to regulate 11 PFAS previously identified in earlier reports (Table 2 PFAS). Table 1 lists eighteen specific PFAS that plaintiffs allege EPA failed to identify in its most recent Biosolids Biennial Report No. 9, despite available scientific evidence showing their presence in concentrations that may affect public health or the environment due to their toxicity, persistence, concentration, mobility, or potential for exposure. Table 2 of the complaint lists PFAS that, according to the plaintiffs, EPA identified as present in sewage sludge as early as its 2012-2013 Biennial Review (No. 5), but for which EPA has also failed to promulgate required regulations despite sufficient evidence of risk. They argued that the Agency’s omissions violate the CWA’s requirement that EPA review sewage sludge regulations at least every two years “for the purpose of identifying additional toxic pollutants” and were arbitrary and capricious under the APA.

The Court’s Reasoning

The court rejected those arguments, emphasizing the distinction between EPA’s biennial duty to review existing biosolids regulations and any subsequent obligation to identify or regulate additional pollutants. The statutory language, the court held, imposes a clear duty only to perform the review itself, not to identify or regulate new contaminants. Because Congress did not set a “date-certain deadline” for regulation, plaintiffs could not invoke the CWA’s citizen-suit provision to compel EPA action.

With respect to the APA, the court determined that neither EPA’s biennial report nor the Agency’s failure to include certain PFAS in that report constituted “final Agency action.” The report, the court noted, is informational in nature, expressly disclaiming any binding effect on regulated entities. A decision not to list a pollutant in the report does not amount to a refusal to regulate and carries no independent legal consequences. Plaintiffs therefore failed to establish the kind of finality required for APA review. Ultimately, the court dismissed the CWA claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the APA claims for failure to state a claim, and the plaintiffs’ “unreasonable delay” claims after plaintiffs themselves conceded dismissal was appropriate.

Broader Implications

EPA has identified PFAS in sewage sludge in past reviews but has not promulgated regulations specific to these substances and, in fact, has not identified new pollutants since 1993. While EPA has issued nine biennial biosolids reviews since 2005, identifying hundreds of chemicals, including 11 PFAS, it has not moved forward with new regulatory standards. The court’s ruling reinforces EPA’s discretion in the timing and scope of regulation, and also signals to stakeholders that meaningful legal challenges may only become viable after EPA denies a formal rulemaking petition.

The dismissal also leaves in place a regulatory gap concerning PFAS in biosolids, which some states have recently moved to close. Maine and Connecticut have banned the land application of biosolids, while Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Vermont have promulgated regulations that require sampling of biosolids and/or establish specific PFAS limits for land application.

Conclusion

The decision provides clarity for regulated entities that courts will not compel EPA to accelerate PFAS regulation through litigation premised on the biennial review requirement. The ruling does not, however, insulate the Agency from future challenges, particularly if it denies or delays petitions seeking new biosolids regulations. Moreover, EPA’s draft biosolids risk assessment, issued by the Biden Administration on January 14, demonstrated risks exceeding EPA’s acceptable thresholds for every human exposure pathway. If the draft risk assessment is finalized, which is certainly not guaranteed because of numerous criticisms concerning the draft’s modeling assumptions, it may require regulatory action. That, however, could be years away. For industries involved in biosolids management, agriculture, and wastewater treatment, the case highlights both the complexity of PFAS regulation and the importance of monitoring evolving state-level initiatives, as state biosolids regulation is likely to be driven by states for the foreseeable future.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16215_5618.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:02:12.364896

U.S. firms need $70 oil to increase the search for new wells.
Firms are already laying off employees.
Chevron, ConocoPhillips and BP will cut thousands of jobs creating billions in savings.
That proved to be the low in oil prices.","I attended a presentation by Roe Patterson this week. He created the private equity firm, Marauder Capital. The firm owns three energy service firms. Why Marauder owns them given what he said is a puzzle to me. Here is his take on U.S. energy.

Drill baby drill is not going to happen at these prices. U.S. firms need $70 oil to increase the search for new wells. In fact, the rig count continues to decline. Firms are already laying off employees. If Trump gets $50 oil, there will be massive layoffs. It will take years to rebuild the employee base. (We have seen this time and again in the Permian Basin).

Solar and wind are unreliable. The sun does not shine at night and the wind does not always blow. Nuclear will take years to build. This means plentiful natural gas is the viable solution. He also noted the very large contracts for export of LNG.

Persuading countries to avoid buying Russian oil will not work. The Russian lifting cost is so low they can still make money at lower prices.

OPEC does not have the extra capacity to increase production by what they claim Patterson was particularly critical of OPEC for falsifying just about everything they say.

ExxonMobil is slashing 2,000 jobs worldwide. This accounts for 3% of its workforce. Since 2014, ExxonMobil has shed 19% or 61,000 jobs. Exxon says their workforce was created decades ago under very different conditions. Chevron, ConocoPhillips and BP will cut thousands of jobs creating billions in savings.

This Thursday, West Texas crude dropped to $60.79. This is the lowest price since August. I have mentioned the overall trend is down. The low for the year was $55 in May. Crude oil is at a crossroads. The Commitment of Traders report has commercials at their lowest net short position since 2010. That proved to be the low in oil prices. There is no guarantee this will repeat. Should the oil price begin to rise, the FED will have to re-think interest rate cuts.

September 23 the DOW closed at 46,714.20. Today’s action Friday morning has the index at 46,841. This is near my upper range of 46,881. An adage has it that the market can remain irrational longer than one can remain solvent betting against it. Social mood market wise remains strong. Until we get a significant pullback, the trend remains up.

The ten-year yield hovers above 4%. Breaking below 3.88% will suggest lower yields. Yields are up a smidge this morning but not enough to reverse the down trend. As with stocks the trend in yield is down.

The monitor shows high levels of an air pollutant known as PM2.5, an extremely tiny particle that can lodge itself deep within the lungs.

Rebekah Ward, climate an environment reporter for the Houston Chronicle, spoke to Texas Standard about how the air effects the residents of Settegast. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So I understand PM2.5, some kind of particulate pollutant, is much smaller than a grain of sand, but can you give us a sense of how the size may factor into just how harmful this pollutant might be for residents?

Rebekah Ward: Absolutely. So PM2.5, sometimes just known as soot, is essentially very small particles of solid or liquid that are so small that they can penetrate deep into the airways. And because they can penetrate deep into your body, they can cause a lot more severe health effects than larger particles that you might more easily be able to see.

The components of smoke that are more visible might not be able to penetrate as deeply, whereas the ones that are so tiny you can’t even see them are actually able to penetrate more deeply and can therefore cause a lot more cardiac problems, lung problems.

Yeah, I was going to ask you about the health effects, because Settegast residents have been living under poor air quality conditions for years. Can you say more about what this means for those living in this neighborhood?

So it’s actually… It’s interesting because Settegast, it is an old neighborhood in Houston and it is the neighborhood with the lowest life expectancy in Harris County.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that that low life expectancy is because of this pollution. However, a lot of the things that people are dying from, including things like cancer, are worsened or made more probable when you breathe in large amounts of PM2.5.

The state has yet to have any answers for Settegast residents because of, as I understand it, some sort of technicality. Can you say more about that technicality and what it would take to improve the air quality for this community?

So many individual, small industrial facilities do need to seek permits from our state environmental agency. And that state environmental agency, when a county does have sort of an overage above the federal standard of the levels of PM2.5 that that county is emitting, they can take specific actions to control that.

That can include, you know, limitations on some of the producers of PM2.5, the industrial producers in neighborhoods like Settegast. But in the case of Harris County, because the monitor in Settegast is actually quite recent – it was only installed a little over three years ago, and it takes three years of continuous data to even determine if you’re out of compliance with the federal standard and then another potentially six years before they have to start implementing any plan to make it better…

That’s a long time for people to live with pollution after they realize how bad it is.

I understand, historically, Houston residents have had to deal with another air pollutant that causes health issues. Can you say more about what you were reported on, what this may mean for a solution for Settegast residents?

Another pollutant that Houston residents have long had to deal with high ozone levels. And ozone is a pollutant that forms in the atmosphere. So some of the same polluters contribute to both PM2.5 and ozone, such as car exhaust has both particulate matter and it has the [volatile organic compounds] VOCs that contribute to ozone pollution.

But the fact that for years, Harris County has been out of compliance with the federal ozone standard and has not yet since it fell out of compliance, been able to bring those levels back down, does not necessarily bode well for its ability to bring us under the threshold for PM2.5.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SettegastHoustonTXSign-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:11:00.519720

Place matters for ambition: South Yorkshire is a critical hub for the UK’s energy ambitions.","Leaders from government, industry and cutting-edge research gathered in South Yorkshire for a landmark summit showcasing the region's pivotal role in the nation’s journey to becoming a clean energy superpower.

Hundreds of delegates from across South Yorkshire and beyond joined the UK Clean Energy Summit 2025, hosted by the University of Sheffield and its Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), at the Magna Science Adventure Centre in Rotherham on 12 September.

With the Summit focussed on accelerating the journey to net-zero while capitalising on clean energy’s potential to boost the economy, create jobs and attract investment, Secretary of State for Energy, Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband set the tone with a special video message:

“My single most important message is that I accept your invitation to work with you to seize the huge opportunities clean energy presents in South Yorkshire, and indeed our country as a whole,” he said.

“Our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower is about delivering energy security, lower bills and the good jobs and growth that we know people want, and protecting our home for our children and grandchildren.”

With opening addresses from University of Sheffield Vice-Chancellor Professor Koen Lamberts and South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard, the summit delved into key challenges and opportunities in the clean energy sector.

Professor Lamberts said: “The government has a clear mission: to cement our country’s position as a global clean energy superpower. But this isn't just about hitting a net-zero target. It is about seizing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to turbocharge national and regional growth. To create high-value jobs, build thriving businesses and attract significant investment.

“Everyone in this room has a role to play in achieving that, and that is the focus of today. How can we maximise the power of collaboration to overcome challenges and turn our ambitions into reality?

“South Yorkshire may have powered the first industrial revolution with steel and coal, but it is now home to the largest clean-tech cluster in the UK. As a region, we stand ready to play our part in powering our country’s future growth and prosperity. And it is a role we take seriously at the University of Sheffield.”

Professor Lamberts also highlighted the many clean energy initiatives the University is leading or partnered in, which are already creating jobs and driving economic growth in the region and beyond. These projects span a range of areas, including sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and small modular reactors.

Ben Morgan, interim CEO at the AMRC, said: “When we set out to organise the UK Clean Energy Summit, our focus was on leveraging this once-in-a-lifetime clean energy mission to deliver tangible impact: more and better jobs, greater investment and a more prosperous future for the next generation.

“The summit has proven that the North has the assets, the skilled workforce and the ambition to be the engine of this new green industrial revolution.

“This is not the time for business-as-usual approaches but rather an extraordinary collaborative effort to translate that ambition into action, ensuring our supply chains are prepared, our skill pathways are robust and our communities can capture the full economic benefits of this moment.”

South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard praised the University and its AMRC for working “hand-in-hand” with industry to help develop and build the future of clean energy, while reiterating the importance of the sense of dignity and purpose that good jobs and a thriving economy can bring.

“Today, as we gather to shape the next chapter of the UK's clean energy journey, I just want to leave you with this: now is the time to be bold for places like South Yorkshire, to once again forge and power a new industrial revolution,” said Mr Coppard.

“We'll only do that by doing it together, and rooting that work in place. And I want to ensure that the clean energy transition is not just a national ambition but wherever you are in the country, a local success.”

Lively and informative panel discussions followed, focussing on building a globally-oriented UK nuclear energy and small modular reactor (SMR) supply chain, harnessing hydrogen technology and capitalising on the significant economic benefits of clean energy.

Steve Bagshaw CBE, Chair, High Value Manufacturing Catapult, said: “The clean energy transition presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform our manufacturing landscape, in South Yorkshire and the whole of the UK. To capitalise, we must harness innovation and collaboration across our supply chains so we can ramp up productivity and global competitiveness.

""With the ambition set out in the government's modern industrial strategy, alongside the support of Innovate UK, we can position UK manufacturers at the forefront of the global net zero revolution, driving economic growth, creating skilled jobs and reinforcing our role as a world leader in sustainable energy solutions, from nuclear SMRs to offshore wind and hydrogen.""

Key takeaways

Demand is global:

The conference emphasised a fundamental reframing of the UK's clean energy goals. Instead of focusing solely on meeting domestic needs, the primary ambition should be to become a global leader. This means aiming to capture a significant share of the worldwide demand to build a scalable, sustainable and export-led industry.

From projects to production:

To seize this global opportunity, the UK's industrial culture must evolve. This means a crucial shift from a project-based mindset centred on building bespoke, one-off solutions, to a production-based one that establishes repeatable, large-scale manufacturing processes needed to compete internationally.

The supply chain bottleneck:

Demand for clean energy technologies will soon outstrip supply. This is a direct call for the UK's industrial base to get ready now. It's about practical scale-up, capacity and modernisation to overcome inevitable bottlenecks and lean into the challenges despite competition for resources.

Place matters for ambition:

South Yorkshire is a critical hub for the UK’s energy ambitions. With over 250 companies in the region to supply into global markets and the presence of world-class institutions like the AMRC and University of Sheffield, the region has enormous capabilities to drive innovation in clean energy technologies.

As articulated by South Yorkshire Mayor, Oliver Coppard, this is about more than just a national imperative; it's about harnessing a regional ecosystem to drive the UK's broader greener, fairer, more secure vision. The political will is strong, both nationally and locally, and the time for delivery is now.",https://www.amrc.co.uk/files/img_cache/4922/1200_630_1759482647_CESlead.jpg?1759482734,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:20.747775

A new tool from a nonprofit climate coalition spearheaded by former Vice President Al Gore aims to help Louisiana residents see how the invisible threat travels — and who’s most at risk.

Introduced at New York Climate Week in late September, Climate TRACE is a new website that aims to show an inventory of emissions. The tool models the spread of particulate matter, tiny particles that can lead to heart and lung problems as well as premature death when inhaled.

On a given day, the map uses thousands of dots to show how the pollutants disperse into the air from facilities and into nearby communities. The tool also shows how much the same facilities contribute to human-caused climate change, as both the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels.

“The connection between the climate crisis and the public health crisis driven by particulate pollution from the burning of fossil fuels to make petrochemicals, power transportation or generate power has not often received adequate attention,” Gore said in an interview.

Gore teased the release of the tool at an August event in St. James Parish. His group first developed it to depict how pollution travels in Louisiana’s 85-mile-long petrochemical corridor along the Mississippi River, nicknamed “Cancer Alley.” After working with groups in the region, Gore said he was shocked by how severe health problems had become for local residents. Then, his group decided to expand the project.

“When we succeeded in visualizing the particulate pollution in Cancer Alley, it became apparent that this was something we should do all over the country and the world,” Gore said.

He said he hoped the new data and modeling will help community groups make their case to local officials and hold companies accountable.

“There could be some companies that want to swap out their supply chains so that they are not contributing to the disease burden in communities like the River Parishes,” Gore said.

Climate TRACE is already working with some subnational governments, business leaders and other organizations to choose suppliers with lower emissions, Gore said.

The tool itself was developed by Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab, combining pollution and weather datasets to model the plumes of particulate matter as the prevailing wind changes. It also uses satellite data and remote sensing to more accurately track greenhouse gas emissions.

Amy Gottsegen with the CREATE lab said Climate TRACE is a much larger, global version of plume modeling her lab creates for the Pittsburgh area each day to help people reduce their exposure to bad air quality.

She noted the tool is limited by the data available. For example, facilities don’t report how much particulate matter they emit each day, so the team uses monthly data to create a daily average.

They’ve also estimated what pollution plumes look like on days with the greatest emissions. The visualization can’t be used to precisely say how much pollution a community is exposed to, but the denser concentrations of particles indicate where more pollution was modeled to be at ground level.

Eventually, Gore hopes this global plume modeling tool — which currently depicts pollution across 9,500 urban areas — will mimic CREATE Lab’s Pittsburgh model, providing new plume modeling as close to real-time as possible. The timeline for such a roll out would likely take years, though, Gore said.

When he announced the tool in St. James, Gore noted that this tool alone won’t help reduce pollution, but communities empowered with information could.

“The information doesn’t do anything by itself unless you turn it into action,” he said. “If you’ve got neighbors and friends to whom you’ve been talking about this, and you have not been able to strike a spark, show them this … Maybe it’ll make it easier to see clearly.”

Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

By the numbers

$7.6 billion

The amount of clean energy project funding canceled by the U.S. Department of Energy this week. The targeted awards were for 223 clean energy projects — all in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

$625 million

How much the DOE says it will make available for “beautiful, clean coal.” The funding, cast as an “investment,” is intended to retrofit and recommission coal plants, but the agency has not given details about the structure or source of the money.

$16.6 billion

The increase in revenue driven by data center load from PJM’s last two capacity auctions, according to a Monitoring Analytics, the grid operator’s market monitor. The number accounts for more than half of the total revenue, and the monitor called data centers the “primary reason” for high capacity prices.

40 MW

The decrease in total U.S. coal capacity from January to July, despite modest new additions and delayed retirements, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s latest monthly infrastructure report. Solar continues to account for most of the new generation capacity.

4.9 GW/15 GWh

The Three Mile Island nuclear power plant on the outskirts of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is the site of the worst commercial nuclear accident in U.S. history. The 1979 calamity, which released radioactive material into the environment, cast nuclear energy as a dangerous endeavor that few organizations pursued. Now, after years of plants shutting down, nuclear energy is experiencing a renaissance.

Three Mile Island will be restarted in 2027 as the Crane Clean Energy Center, in part to power data centers after a power purchase agreement with Microsoft. Meta also saved a nuclear plant in Illinois that was in danger of closing after signing a 1.1 GW deal. These two major deals signal a growing trend of hyperscalers embracing nuclear power and driving forward expansive new growth.

While nuclear offers stable power with low-carbon emissions, the potential for it to truly reshape the energy market and fulfill the promise of a renaissance requires overcoming complex operational, financial and workforce challenges.

Data centers driving the demand

Recent policy support from the Trump administration has accelerated nuclear development at a new speed, but the increased investment has been on the horizon for years. In 2023, under the Biden administration, the U.S. joined more than 20 other countries in a pledge to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 to reach climate goals. Countries have been trying to figure out how to feed a surging demand for energy across the world without hurting the environment, and they’ve turned to nuclear power to fulfill that need.

But what’s different about the surge we’re seeing now is the sheer pace at which companies want to get these plants up and running again. They’re trying to keep up with demand to power the data centers needed to support the explosive growth in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. According to Goldman Sachs, AI alone will drive a 165% increase in power demand for data centers in the next five years.

The demand for this power has created a unique dynamic where tech companies are willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrading nuclear facilities that have been offline for years in exchange for long-term power purchase agreements. Unlike traditional utility customers, these companies can sign decades-long contracts that justify the substantial upfront investments required to bring aging nuclear infrastructure back online.

The realities of bringing plants back online

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

There are 94 operating nuclear reactors in the United States and 18 reactors that are retired or are in the process of retiring. Almost half of the retired/retiring reactors are currently undergoing Nuclear Regulatory Commission evaluation to restart. The rest are older and would be too costly to touch. But even so, the ones that could be restarted have been mothballed for years and require hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades and a lengthy project timeline to be powered up again.

Think about any building that has been boarded up for at least five years. No matter the condition, repairs, upgrades, and inspections are needed. That need is exacerbated at a highly specialized and sensitive building like a nuclear power plant. Decommissioned facilities need to restore operating licenses, meet regulatory compliance standards, and fix a major vulnerability: the lack of modern cybersecurity standards.

The environment we’re in now of sophisticated cyber threats is a whole new world compared to when some of these older plants last operated. Cyberattacks on U.S. utilities reportedly jumped 70% last year. Major upgrades need to be put in place so the plants aren’t left vulnerable to bad actors.

Another bottleneck is the supply chain. The capacity to produce uranium rods was scaled back during nuclear’s decline, and rebuilding this manufacturing infrastructure will take time. These are not components that can be quickly sourced from existing inventory; they require specialized facilities and rigorous quality controls.

An equally daunting challenge is human capital. Most experienced nuclear power plant operators retired when facilities shut down over the past decade, taking all of that institutional knowledge with them. Training new operators won’t happen overnight. These are highly specialized positions requiring extensive certification and experience with complex safety protocols. The situation is further complicated by competition from other sectors offering better incentives for nuclear engineers, making it difficult for utilities to attract and retain talent.

Why a broader energy mix still matters

Once the industry gets past these obstacles, even the most optimistic nuclear scenarios cannot eliminate the need for a diverse energy portfolio. Though some natural gas and renewable power projects back off during this time, we’ve also seen continued growth. In Texas, the state’s energy fund just approved its first loan to fund a 122-megawatt natural gas power plant that is projected to begin operations by 2027.

A surge of investment in nuclear power does not mean that it will take over all other resources. Different technologies serve different purposes for grid operations. Nuclear provides excellent baseload power, but grids also need flexible generation that can ramp up and down quickly to match demand fluctuations. Solar and wind, despite their intermittency challenges, remain cost-effective for many applications and will continue to play essential roles in the energy mix.

Even where nuclear development is feasible, the long lead time for a plant to become operational means that other technologies must fill the gap during the years-long transition period. Energy security requires multiple sources operating in concert rather than betting everything on a single technology.

Reshaping the energy market and future financing

Read More in Generation

Data centers have handed nuclear something it’s rarely had: customers willing to pay upfront for guaranteed power over the long haul. Instead of hoping subsidies stick around, companies are putting money behind their need for reliable electricity. It creates a financing model built on genuine market demand. If this proves successful, it could shape the future financing of projects from industries beyond tech companies.

With this demand bolstering the industry, the major concern is that projects to restart nuclear plants will be sped up to keep pace. But they cannot be rushed. Success will require policy support, sustained investment in workforce development, reinforcing the supply chain, and patience to deal with inevitable delays and cost overruns that characterize major infrastructure projects.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hIdsAudTEAQ30lovdVYmOOsNwxVlhWu7zfHQLuo6vbY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNTY3MTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-03 13:02:30.243510

The majority of the EV defectors surveyed — 60 percent — would need an incentive of at least $5,000 to consider an EV, and nearly 30 percent would reconsider an EV with an incentive ranging from $2,500 to $4,999. Eleven percent would settle for an incentive of less than $2,500.

The tax credits have been a driving force in the EV market, contributing to a boost in sales in recent years. The loss of the credits propelled an EV sales surge in the third quarter, but analysts warned that demand would decline after Sept. 30.

The results of the Harris Poll’s survey are based on responses from 2,095 adults in the U.S., 1,675 of whom said they plan to buy or lease a new or used vehicle in the future. Of those respondents, 485 said they were extremely or somewhat likely to purchase an EV. The survey was Sept. 23-25.

Incentives are important to EV adoption because affordability remains a top concern among buyers, said Greg Paratore, senior consultant at the Harris Poll. Affordability is the top concern for 64 percentof EV buyers, according to an August study by the Harris Poll and Urban Science.

The loss of the tax credits presents an opportunity for automakers to build consumer trust by sharing the cost burden of an EV transition, Paratore said.

“They can preserve momentum if they step in with credible value,” he said.

Some automakers are trying to support customers with the loss of the credits, with General Motors and Ford both putting lease programs into place to extend the EV tax credit for new vehicles through the fourth quarter.

Hyundai is cutting the price of the 2026 Ioniq 5, its top-selling EV, up to $9,800 depending on the trim. The brand is also extending a $7,500 cash incentive on remaining 2025 Ioniq 5 inventory through October.

A new poll shows Americans are still open to EVs if discounts are available. The good news: Carmakers are already stepping up with price cuts and incentives.

30%: Americans May Continue Buying EVs: Poll

Photo by: InsideEVs

Analysts have projected that EV sales may decline significantly with the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit. Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has estimated that the EV market will be significantly smaller, possibly accounting for only about 5% of the overall car market, compared to 11% in the third quarter.

But a new Harris Poll published by Automotive News suggests Americans aren’t ready to give up on EVs just yet. The vast majority of the 2,000+ respondents surveyed in late September said they’d still consider an EV—if the price was right.

Here is more from the outlet:

The majority of the EV defectors surveyed—60%—would need an incentive of at least $5,000 to consider an EV, and nearly 30 percent would reconsider an EV with an incentive ranging from $2,500 to $4,999. Eleven percent would settle for an incentive of less than $2,500.

Incentives are important to EV adoption because affordability remains a top concern among buyers, said Greg Paratore, senior consultant at the Harris Poll. Affordability is the top concern for 64% of EV buyers, according to an August study by the Harris Poll and Urban Science.

Sept. 30 has come and gone, but the discounts still exist. Sales growth may not be as robust as it was before, but if automakers continue to offer technologically superior vehicles at competitive prices, buyers will not run away.

General Motors and Ford have extended the use of the federal tax credit by having their financing arms purchase EVs on dealer lots with initial down payments, which would qualify those models for the tax credit. It’s a creative arrangement that will lower purchase price or monthly lease payments.

The 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 5 now gets an average price cut of over $9,000. That means the starting price of the Ioniq 5 is now $35,000 before destination. That’s on par with the Chevy Equinox EV and Toyota bZ, which are both competitive but not as advanced as the Ioniq 5, which gets rides on an 800-volt architecture with some of the fastest-charging speeds in the U.S. Hyundai will also continue offering $7,500 cash incentives on model year 2025 Ioniq 5s, which are on dealer lots through October.

Rivian’s lease deals have not vanished either. The EV start-up is offering a $6,500 rebate on select R1T and R1S models to customers who take delivery of their vehicles before October 31.

Also note that several affordable models are imminent. The all-new Nissan Leaf with over 300 miles of range and a $30,000 starting price is now on sale. The next-generation Chevy Bolt EV is around the corner, and it’s already leaked. Additionally, Tesla has a more affordable Model Y (or whatever it will be called) in the pipeline. The timing is ripe for these affordable EVs, and they might help the industry continue moving forward despite the broad attack on clean energy from the White House.

At the same time, the plan to continue growing the EV market share comes at the expense of automakers' bottom lines more than ever, right when they're getting slammed by tariff costs. That could end up being a toxic cocktail. As before, get the deals while they last.

60%: Some Tesla Investors To Vote Against Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Compensation

Photo by: YouTube

Some Tesla inventors aren’t thrilled about the prospect of CEO Elon Musk becoming the world’s first trillionaire. He already became the first half-trillionaire this week. This group comprises the SOC Investment Group and state treasurers from Nevada, New Mexico, and Connecticut.

Here’s more from Reuters:

The group cited what it called the board's ""relentless pursuit"" of retaining Musk, saying it has delayed progress on key goals set at the last annual meeting, and pointed to declining operational and financial performance and a ""failure to provide meaningful real-time oversight of management.""

The news comes as Tesla investors shrugged off record Q3 deliveries of nearly half a million EV sales globally. Tesla’s share price dropped by 3% as of Thursday afternoon, indicating that the company’s market value is closely tied to developments in AI and robotics, rather than vehicle sales.

90%: After Years Of Rapid Growth, BYD Sales Decline In China

Photo by: Kevin Williams/InsideEVs

BYD has experienced explosive growth in China over the past five years, as the automaker ceased production of gas cars and focused solely on battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. But its sales declined for the first time in half a decade amid rising competition and government intervention to prevent predatory pricing.

Here’s more from Nikkei:

Since March 2025, year-on-year growth has slowed with each passing month. In August, sales rose just 0.1%, and they fell 6% in September to 396,270 units. Passenger cars, which account for over 90% of sales, were down 6% to 393,060 units.

Rivals Geely, Leapmotor, and Xiaomi have been rapidly growing in China, offering cutting-edge EVs at competitive rates. Additionally, the Chinese government intervened amid the price war, which was hurting smaller suppliers who were receiving delayed payments from car companies, sometimes as long as 200 days in some cases.

A regulatory change in June now forces companies like BYD to pay suppliers within 60 days of component delivery. Now BYD is seeking to make up for the slowdown in China by expanding in Europe, with a new plant under construction in Hungary. And it showcased several new models at the IAA Mobility 2025 motor show in Munich last month.

100%: Which Brand Will Win The Affordable EV Battle?

Photo by: Motor1.com

The $35,000 Chevy Equinox EV shot to the top of GM’s sales charts when it went on sale last year, proving that buyers will jump at an EV with decent range and a reasonable price tag. But the Equinox EV now faces serious competition. Hyundai is rolling out a similarly priced 2026 Ioniq 5. Nissan has opened orders for its new Leaf. And Tesla’s long-rumored affordable Model Y-based crossover is lurking just around the corner.

So who do you think is best positioned to win? Buyers want low prices, but also quick charging stops and the ability to occasionally take long-distance road trips. Will it be Tesla, Hyundai, or GM? Or could Nissan, Ford, or even Toyota stage a surprise comeback?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/4047AJ/s1/cm-nissan-leaf-8-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:08:44.686979

DETROIT – Tesla and General Motors are leading the U.S. automotive industry this year in record domestic sales of all-electric vehicles, as consumers hurried to buy EVs before up to $7,500 in federal incentives for each purchase ended in September.

New data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence shows U.S. sales of EVs, excluding hybrids, topped 1 million units through the first nine months of the year and set a new quarterly record of more than 438,000 units sold during the third quarter — achieving market share of 10.5% for the period.

That record market share is up from 7.4% during the second quarter and 7.6% during the first three months of the year, according to Motor Intelligence. Sales of all-electric models were estimated to be 1.3 million in 2024, with a roughly 8% market share.

U.S. EV industry leader Tesla, which does not report sales by region, is estimated to have retained its leadership position with a 43.1% market share through September, according to the data. That's down from 49% to end last year, as competitors continue to release new EVs.

Stock Chart IconStock chart icon

GM, which offers the most EV models in the U.S., has made significant gains this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September.

The sales data comes two days after GM estimated it leads the U.S. industry in EV market share growth so far in 2025, with the lowest incentives of any major automaker. It sold 144,668 EVs through September, which still only represented 6.8% of its total U.S. sales.

""No one is in a stronger position for a changing U.S. market than GM,"" Duncan Aldred, GM president of North America, said in a release. ""We have the best lineup of ICE [internal combustion engine] and EV vehicles we've ever had. Our brands have grown market share with consistently strong pricing, and low incentives and inventory.""

Following Tesla, GM and Hyundai, Motor Intelligence data shows Ford Motor's EV market share was 6.6% through the third quarter, followed by Volkswagen at 5.4%; Honda Motor at 4.6%; and BMW at 3.6%.

Michael Wayland | CNBC

Despite sales increasing each quarter of this year, EV startups Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group continue to have a relatively small EV market share. Lucid remains under 1%, while Rivian was at 3% through September.

Major automakers reported third-quarter results this week that were led by EV sales. The rush to buy electric cars came ahead of the federal incentives for those vehicles ending as a result of the Trump administration's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

Industry analysts and executives believe the incentives ending will create a boom-and-bust cycle for the sale of EVs in the U.S.

Ford CEO Jim Farley on Tuesday said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if sales of EVs fell from an industry market share of around 10% to 12% in September to 5% after the incentive program ends.

The end of EV credits for the U.S. comes as the country continues to trail other major automakers in the adoption of zero-emission vehicles. The International Energy Agency reports China continued to lead EV adoption globally last year, with sales of 6.4 million all-electric vehicles, not counting hybrids, followed by Europe at 2.2 million units.

The Public Utility Commission of Texas on Thursday selected a route and authorized Entergy to develop the Southeast Texas Area Reliability Project, or SETEX, which includes a 145-mile, 500-kV transmission line and other associated equipment.

Entergy Texas operates outside of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid that serves most of the Lone Star State. The SETEX project aims to boost reliability in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator footprint.

The PUCT also on Thursday selected six projects to receive about $381 million in support from the Texas Energy Fund’s Outside ERCOT Grant Program. Of the grants, Entergy could receive about $200 million.

Dive Insight:

Texas regulators have approved about $4 billion in Entergy investments in the last month. The utility serves approximately 524,000 customers.

In September, the commission approved a pair of new Entergy gas plants with a $2.4 billion price tag. And the SETEX project will reportedly cost an estimated $1.4 billion.

“Growth in Southeast Texas is creating incredible opportunities for the communities we serve, and it’s our responsibility to ensure we build a resilient power grid that supports long-term economic expansion and future energy needs,” Entergy Texas CEO Eliecer Viamontes said in a statement.

The SETEX project includes two new stations: the Babel Switching Station in Newton County and Running Bear Substation in Montgomery County, the company said. The transmission line will pass through Jasper, Montgomery, Newton, Polk, San Jacinto, Trinity, Tyler and Walker counties.

The route approved by regulators at Thursday’s open meeting will cross Lake Livingston, which had been a key point of debate.

MISO identified the SETEX project through its long-range planning process as critical to ensuring compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corp. baseline standards and the provision of reliable and cost-effective service as demand continues to grow, according to Entergy.

The selected route “affects the fewest number of habitable structures, has the lowest estimated cost of the focus routes, and was identified by Entergy as best meeting the criteria the Commission must consider,” PUCT Chairman Thomas Gleeson wrote in a memo ahead of the vote.

The PUCT also tapped six projects outside ERCOT to receive grants from the Texas Energy Fund. While the fund is best known for providing low-cost loans to support gas generation in ERCOT, it has multiple programs and the Outside ERCOT Grant Program provides funding for transmission and distribution infrastructure or electric generating facilities not in the organized Texas market.

The outside-ERCOT program “maybe didn’t get as much attention as the inside-ERCOT piece, but it is just as important,” Gleeson said.

Commissioner Kathleen Jackson noted that the grants are not final, and the PUCT and utilities must still reach execution agreements.

Just last month, Rep. Gabe Evans (R-Colo.) toured United Power’s Mountain Peak natural gas peaking plant. It’s part of a move away from coal.

“This investment will help provide more reliable, safe, and affordable energy for #CO08,” Evans wrote on social media in September.

The Department of Energy canceled a $6 million grant for the rural electric cooperative Wednesday.

His office, along with numerous other Republican offices contacted for this story, did not respond to requests for comment.

DOE’s termination Wednesday of 321 financial awards worth roughly $7.56 billion was touted by White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as retribution against Democrats for the government shutdown and a chance to dismantle the “Green New Scam” — the Republican pejorative for Democratic legislation passed during the Biden era.

But according to details sent to Congress and compiled by Hill Democrats, the award cancellations include dozens of job-creating projects in congressional districts controlled by Republicans.

“This was obviously designed as a political attack by the White House targeting Democrats. But the sad reality is that Americans — the middle class, working class, and vulnerable — who voted for both Democrats and Republicans will be hurt by this,” said House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).

Still, at least one Republican said he was OK with the cuts, even if they affected his district. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), a conservative with libertarian sensibilities, shrugged at the loss of three projects in his district totaling $110 million.

“Call me old fashioned, but I think that companies should make their money by pleasing their customers and not by using government to take money away from families that they have earned,” he said in a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News.

The three projects include a glass container plant, an electronics recycling operation and a biofuels power plant.

McClintock went on to cite a free-market French economist from the 1800s, Frédéric Bastiat, as backup for his stance.

“In the 19th Century, Bastiat called this ‘plunder,’ and it still is today,” he added. “I strongly support the DOE decision for all the reasons I outlined in my ‘just say no to subsidies‘ speech last year.”

Previous GOP support

In all, at least 28 GOP lawmakers would see spending tied to their districts canceled, while 108 Democrats’ districts would be hit.

Democrats raged against the cuts Thursday. Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) called the administration’s actions “nakedly political, unhinged and unlawful.” He said his state lost $135.2 million in funding, with projects ranging from a carbon storage hub effort to a battery storage system.

The cancellations with the highest dollar amount were related to DOE’s hydrogen hub program, an effort made possible by the bipartisan infrastructure law. It was designed to create a national network of hydrogen fuel producers. DOE canceled funding for both the ARCHES hub in California and another hub in the Pacific Northwest.

The $1 billion Pacific Northwest project was slated to rope in three states: Washington, Oregon and Republican-led Montana. Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte had heralded the Pacific Northwest project’s job-creating impact at the time of its announcement in 2023.

“Through its investment in St. Regis, the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub will create more good-paying Montana jobs and ramp up American-made energy in the Treasure State,” Gianforte said.

Four California House Republicans — Reps. Vince Fong, David Valadao, Jay Obernolte and Young Kim — had previously signed a letter urging DOE not to cancel funding for the ARCHES hydrogen hub.

The bipartisan letter sent to Energy Secretary Chris Wright in April asserted the project was a “strategic investment in American energy innovation,” that was part of “an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and energy independence and competitiveness.”

“[W]e respectfully request that you continue supporting ARCHES and provide time for the California hub and its member organizations to further justify their vital role in meeting the energy goals of the administration,” they wrote.

‘What took so long?’

Other projects appear to be targeted at companies in Democratic states but have spill-over impacts in red districts.

For example, Moment Energy, based in Delaware, had a $20 million award canceled for a manufacturing facility creating grid-scale batteries. That factory, however, was slated to be constructed in Texas — specifically in the district of Republican Rep. John Carter — and is expected to create more than 50 manufacturing jobs and 200 permanent positions.

Conservatives have been eager to see the Trump administration slash government funding for clean energy projects across the country. Trump ordered agencies to “terminate the Green New Deal” on his first day back in office.

Many on the right welcomed this week’s news, but at least one had a lingering question.

“What took so long?” asked Tom Pyle, president of the conservative and fossil-fuel-funded Institute for Energy Research.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/39/ef/fb10b8884d3cabf9af73dc9b25c4/u-s-congress-07624.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:11:17.292443

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

As it turns out, the Fort Wayne data center is not an exception: Approximately 44% of all data centers proposed in Indiana are in counties that have restricted or banned new renewable energy projects.
“The primary challenges are the size of the data center and the amount of space it takes to build renewables,” he said.
“They are moving from 20 megawatt or 40 megawatt data centers to 100, 200, 300 megawatt data centers.
In the end, it really does seem like data centers are being sited in places with renewable energy restrictions.","Data centers are being built in places that restrict renewable energy. There are significant implications for our future energy grid – but it’s unclear if this behavior will lead to tech companies eschewing renewables or finding novel ways to still meet their clean energy commitments.

In the previous edition of The Fight, I began chronicling the data center boom and a nascent backlash to it by talking about Google and what would’ve been its second data center in southern Indianapolis, if the city had not rejected it last Monday. As I learned about Google’s practices in Indiana, I focused on the company’s first project – a $2 billion facility in Fort Wayne, because it is being built in a county where officials have instituted a cumbersome restrictive ordinance on large-scale solar energy. The county commission recently voted to make the ordinance more restrictive, unanimously agreeing to institute a 1,000-foot setback to take effect in early November, pending final approval from the county’s planning commission.

As it turns out, the Fort Wayne data center is not an exception: Approximately 44% of all data centers proposed in Indiana are in counties that have restricted or banned new renewable energy projects. This is according to a review of Heatmap Pro data in which we cross-referenced the county bans and ordinances we track against a list of proposed data centers prepared by an Indiana energy advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana.

This doesn’t necessarily mean the power going to these data centers is consistently fossil. Data centers can take years to construct and often rely on power fed to them from a distributed regional energy grid. But this does mean it would be exceptionally costly for any of these projects to build renewable generation on site, as a rising number of projects choose to do – not to mention that on a macro level, data centers may increasingly run up against the same cultural dynamics that are leading to solar and wind project denials. (See: this local news article about the Fort Wayne data center campus).

Chrissy Moy, a Google spokesperson, told me the Fort Wayne facility will get its power off of the PJM grid, and sent me links to solar projects and hydroelectric facilities in other states on the PJM it has power purchase agreements with. I’d note the company claims it “already matches” all of its global annual electricity demand with “renewable energy purchases.” What this means is that if Google can’t generate renewable energy for a data center directly, it will try to procure renewable energy at the same time from the same grid, even if it can’t literally use that clean power at that data center. And if that's not possible, it will search farther afield or at different times. (Google is one of the more aggressive big tech companies in this regard, as my colleague Emily Pontecorvo details.) Google has also boasted that it will provide an undisclosed amount of excess clean electricity through rights transfers to Indiana Michigan Power when the tech company’s load is low and demand on the broader grid is peaking, as part of Google’s broader commitment to grid flexibility.

I reached out to Tom Wilson, an energy systems technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, an industry-focused organization that studies modern power and works with tech companies on flexible data center energy use, including Google. Wilson told me that in Indiana, many of the siting decisions for data centers were made before counties enacted moratoria against renewable energy and that tech companies may not always be knowingly siting projects in places where significant solar or wind generation would be impractical or even impossible. (We would just note that Fort Wayne, Indiana, has an opposition risk score of 84 in Heatmap Pro, meaning it would have been a very risky place to build a renewable energy project even without that restrictive ordinance.) It also indicates some areas may be laying down renewables restrictions after seeing data center development, which is in line with a potential land use techlash.

Wilson told me that two thirds of data centers rely on power from the existing energy grid whereas surveys indicate about a third choose to have at least some electricity generation on site. In at least the latter case, land use constraints and permitting problems really can be a hurdle for building renewable energy close to where data is processed. This is a problem exacerbated when centers are developed near population centers, which Wilson said is frequently the case because companies want to reduce “latency” for customers. In other words, they want to “reduce the time it takes to get answers to people” via artificial intelligence or other data products.

“The primary challenges are the size of the data center and the amount of space it takes to build renewables,” he said. “They are moving from 20 megawatt or 40 megawatt data centers to 100, 200, 300 megawatt data centers. It’s really hard to locate that much renewable [energy] right near a population center. So that requires transmission, and unfortunately right now in the U.S. and in many other countries, transmission takes a significant amount of time to build.”

The majority of data centers are served by regional power grids, Wilson told me. Companies like Google, Meta, and others continue to invest in renewable energy procurement while building facilities in areas that have restricted new solar or wind power infrastructure. In some cases, companies may feel they’re forced to seek these places out because the land is just plain cheap and has existing fiber optic cable networks.

At the same time, there are large data centers getting energy generated on site, and how they each approach their energy sources varies. It’s also not always consistent.

For instance, Meta’s new Prometheus supercluster complex in New Albany, Ohio — potentially the world’s first 1 gigawatt data center — will reportedly have a significant amount of new gas power generation constructed at the facility, even though the company also struck a deal with Invenergy over the summer to procure at least 400 megawatts of solar from two projects in Ohio that already have their permits. One is in Clinton County and was fully permitted but resulted in a years-long fight before the Ohio Power Siting Board and included conservative media backlash. The other is in Franklin County and got its permits in 2021, before a recent wave of opposition against solar projects. Prometheus itself will be sited on the Licking County side of New Albany, where solar has been extremely difficult to build, even though most of this Columbus suburb is in solar-supporting Franklin.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s xAI data center notoriously relies on a polluting gas plant in Memphis, Tennessee. The surrounding Shelby County had a solar moratorium until mere months ago that residents want to bring back. An affiliate company of xAI used for the project’s real estate is subleasing land near the data center for a solar farm, but it is unclear right now if it’ll power the data center.

In the end, it really does seem like data centers are being sited in places with renewable energy restrictions. What the data center developers plan to do about it — if anything — is still an open question.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY3MDUwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzM0OTIwNH0.R2bL8NHbYY3cBJ872x8jlNQIb-iWXY9o7upuQnet07U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-03 12:12:39.262211

What are the Major Government Initiatives and Policies for Electric Vehicle Batteries?

Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme in India

India's PLI scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage aims to boost domestic battery manufacturing by allocating INR 181 billion (approximately USD 2.2 billion). The program targets a cumulative 50 GWh of domestic manufacturing capacity by 2025, with incentives tied to sales and domestic value addition.

Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) 2024 in India

The Indian government extended the EMPS 2024 until September 30, 2024, increasing its funding to INR 778 crore (USD 94 million). The scheme supports the adoption of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, with incentives focused on commercial and corporate use, promoting domestic manufacturing and job creation.

Green Deal Industrial Plan in the European Union

The EU's Green Deal Industrial Plan, introduced in 2023, includes provisions for faster permitting of battery production facilities and financial support for net-zero projects. The plan also proposes a Critical Raw Materials Act to ensure secure supply chains for essential minerals used in EV batteries.

Incentives for Local EV Production in South Africa

South Africa announced a 1-billion-rand (USD 54 million) investment to support local EV and battery production, aiming to transition the automotive industry by 2035. The initiative includes attracting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and implementing a regional critical minerals strategy.

Battery Passport Initiative by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

The U.S. NIST is developing an EV Battery Passport to enhance transparency and traceability in the battery supply chain. The initiative aims to improve recycling, reduce environmental impact, and ensure the ethical sourcing of materials.

Key Market Trends

Declining Battery Costs: The global average price of EV batteries has decreased from $153 per kWh in 2022 to $149 per kWh in 2023, with projections suggesting a further drop to $80 per kWh by 2026. This reduction is driven by advancements in manufacturing processes and economies of scale, making EVs more affordable and accelerating adoption.

Shift Towards Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Batteries: LFP batteries, which are less expensive and safer than traditional nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries, are gaining popularity. In 2024, LFP batteries accounted for nearly half of the global EV battery market, with China leading this shift. However, adoption in the U.S. remains below 10%, partly due to existing tariffs on Chinese imports.

Advancements in Solid-State Battery Technology: Solid-state batteries, utilizing a solid electrolyte instead of a liquid one, offer higher energy densities, faster charging times, and enhanced safety. Companies like Toyota, BMW, and Volkswagen are actively developing this technology, aiming for commercialization by 2025.

Increased Demand for Battery Metals: The surge in EV production has led to a significant rise in the demand for critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. In 2023, battery demand for these metals reached approximately 140 kt for lithium, 150 kt for cobalt, and nearly 370 kt for nickel, accounting for substantial portions of global demand.

Integration of EV Batteries into Energy Storage Systems: EV batteries are increasingly being utilized in stationary energy storage applications, such as home and industrial battery storage systems. In Germany, for instance, the market for home storage systems grew by 52% in 2022, highlighting the expanding role of EV batteries beyond transportation.

GM’s Q3 EV sales record of 66,501 units helped boost the automaker’s quarterly sales 8% YoY.
US EV market leader Tesla reported 7% growth in quarterly deliveries.
The brand’s EV sales grew 100% while hybrids were up 48%.
Kondrat offered a counterpoint to the gloom, pointing to California’s EV market maintaining stable sales rates after doing away with state incentives.","Time’s up.

A federal tax incentive that offered up to $7,500 off the price of EVs is officially dead thanks to President Trump’s tax and budget bill, a development that has prompted predictions of cratering demand from US auto executives.

“It’s a game-changer,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said at an event in Detroit this week. “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5% of our industry, from, probably, this month, 10% [or] 12%.”

Smashing records: With the clock ticking down to the Sept. 30 expiration date, Q3 saw a surge in EV demand. Cox Automotive forecast a record 410,000 sales, up 21.1% YoY and 30% over Q2. The EV boom lifted the entire new-vehicle market in Q3, according to industry analysts.

“The biggest driver of September’s strong sales pace is temporarily inflated demand for electric vehicles,” Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at JD Power, said in a statement. The firm’s data showed EVs reaching 12.2% market share in September, up 2.6 percentage points from a year ago, translating to a 27.5% increase in EV sales.

GM’s Q3 EV sales record of 66,501 units helped boost the automaker’s quarterly sales 8% YoY. “No one is in a stronger position for a changing US market than GM,” Duncan Aldred, GM senior VP and president of North America, said in a statement.

Ford’s 8.2% YoY sales gain got a lift from the automaker’s record electrified vehicle sales. Ford reported new sales records for both hybrids and battery-electric vehicles, with BEVs up 30.2%.

US EV market leader Tesla reported 7% growth in quarterly deliveries.

Hyundai had its best-ever Q3, with sales up 13% YoY. The brand’s EV sales grew 100% while hybrids were up 48%.

Sister brand Kia also reported a record quarterly performance, and said that its electrified vehicle sales grew 26% through September.

American Honda’s sales fell 2% YoY in Q3, but the automaker said that “record sales of electrified models” helped it navigate “challenging market conditions.”

Toyota reported a nearly 16% YoY sales gain and a 10.5% leap in electrified vehicle sales.

BEVs even outsold the popular hybrid segment in September, Tom Kondrat, global lead of advanced analytics for Urban Science, told Tech Brew.

Extended savings: Numerous automakers have made moves to extend EV deals past the credits’ expiration date.

GM and Ford introduced programs to effectively extend the $7,500 credit on EV leases, Reuters reported this week. And Hyundai announced Wednesday that it’s slashing prices across its 2026 Ioniq 6 lineup by up to $9,800, and maintaining $7,500 cash incentives for 2025 model year EVs.

“While the $7,500 EV credit has expired, our electrification strategy has always extended beyond incentives,” Randy Parker, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, said in a statement. “We invested in EV innovation well before the [Inflation Reduction Act] and remain steadfast in our commitment to affordability, quality, and customer care.”

Tackling affordability challenges will be key to maintaining momentum in the EV market, according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights.

“With $7,500 incentives eliminated, the case for EVs now rests on performance, technology, and total cost of ownership, rather than subsidies,” she wrote.

Kondrat offered a counterpoint to the gloom, pointing to California’s EV market maintaining stable sales rates after doing away with state incentives.

“There’s too much infrastructure that’s been invested. There’s too much production capacity,” he said. “I think the market will align. Automakers will find ways to make them more affordable, ways to make them more attractive, and we will see a continued trend upward.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/302eb655dc2823dcbda6752fdd2a6a78145d8026-700x467.gif?rect=0,49,700,368&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-10-03 10:59:46.879678

The Energy Department said the award recipients have 30 days to file an appeal.
“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.
Since taking office, Trump has made federal funding cuts a centerpiece of his second administration, saying he wants to cut waste, fraud and abuse.
So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.” But the latest maneuver could have the opposite effect as Democrats dig in further over the energy funding cuts.","A dozen federal grants that support energy projects in Connecticut are on the chopping block as the Trump administration cuts more funding in the early days of a government shutdown.

President Donald Trump has warned that his administration could wield executive power to make a shutdown painful for Democrats and “[cut] things that they like.” And he’s appearing to quickly follow through on that threat in mostly blue states — and Connecticut is among the targets.

The U.S. Department of Energy said Thursday it’s terminating nearly $8 billion that supports hundreds of clean energy and other climate-related projects across 16 states, including Connecticut. After reviewing all financial awards, the agency decided they “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.”

The Department of Energy has yet to publicly provide a state breakdown of each affected project, and it didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the specific funding cuts in Connecticut.

The Energy Department did provide information to U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s office on Thursday, but the Connecticut Democrat is still trying to track down the exact projects and funding amounts that will now dry up.

“I am demanding more information and specifics into this threatened cut for climate change projects, which are essential for Connecticut,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “We will not be bullied by this destructive and illegal withholding of critical support.”

The funding awarded to Connecticut came from two offices at DOE: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Fossil Energy. Between the eight recipients, they were expected to receive nearly $53 million for various projects, according to House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro.

RTX Corporation, Mott Corporation, Proton Energy Systems Inc., Linde Inc., Calcify Inc., Karpman Consulting LLC, the University of Connecticut and FuelCell Energy were awarded contracts. But the exact amount each will lose is unclear because some projects have been in the works for years and already received parts of the funding.

Some of the projects include funding for a Carbon Capture Machine, the development of a hydrogen refueling station for heavy-duty trucks, and the design of “coated titanium porous transport layers (PTLs) used for water electrolysis.”

At least one recipient doesn’t expect the termination to have much of an effect.

FuelCell Energy, which is headquartered in Danbury, has been working on performance improvements for fuel cell systems for several years. And because that effort has wrapped up, the company anticipates receiving the rest of the money from DOE, which it has worked with since the 1970s on various research projects.

“This particular project has been underway for nearly five years and is now at its conclusion. We have already received the majority of the contract compensation and expect the small remaining balance to be honored, as the work has been fully completed,” FuelCell Energy spokesperson Kathleen Blomquist said in a statement.

The initial news of cuts a day earlier sparked a wave of confusion since there was little information. The state’s congressional delegation was frustrated that the White House would try to “bully” them during the ongoing funding standoff.

About a quarter of the projects under fire were awarded during the final months of the Biden administration, following the November elections, according to DOE. Others date back from years earlier. The Energy Department said the award recipients have 30 days to file an appeal.

Hours into the shutdown, White House Budget Director Russ Vought started posting on social media the various projects and funding that would go away. He first posted that New York City would lose about $18 billion in infrastructure projects, specifically naming the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue subway.

A few hours later, he announced the $8 billion in climate funding cuts. Every state target by those cuts voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, and almost all are led by Democratic governors. They are also represented by Democratic U.S. senators who opposed the GOP funding bill.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Today’s cancellation’s delivers on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

Connecticut officials and lawmakers have received little, if any, information from federal agencies.

James Fowler, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said earlier Thursday that the agency has not received any notice from federal authorities about which projects will be affected by the decision.

“We’re working with what resources we have to figure [it] out,” he said.

Funding awarded to utilities in Connecticut appear unscathed. A spokesperson for Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, confirmed that none of its projects have been affected by the cuts.

While the loss of funding will have real-life consequences in Connecticut, the underlying motives feel political to Democrats. Connecticut’s congressional delegation argues the administration is holding up Democratic priorities like clean energy as “partisan extortion.”

“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment and eliminate jobs,” DeLauro said. “It is reckless and betrays both common sense and public trust.”

U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, also raised concerns about the potential for layoffs and higher energy costs.

“Connecticut residents are already dealing with the rising cost of living and cannot afford increasing energy bills,” Hayes said in a statement.

Since taking office, Trump has made federal funding cuts a centerpiece of his second administration, saying he wants to cut waste, fraud and abuse. But some of the initial cuts led to confusion and chaos earlier this year when he temporarily paused all federal grants. The administration has lifted freezes on certain funds.

But the issue has again gripped Washington, and the finger-pointing over the shutdown has only intensified in recent days.

The parties couldn’t agree to a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, that would keep government agencies running at current levels.

“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said Tuesday. “And you know all you all know Russell Vought. He’s become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn’t do any other way. So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.”

But the latest maneuver could have the opposite effect as Democrats dig in further over the energy funding cuts.

“Just naked and brazen corruption,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Time to stiffen our spines and demand that we only fund a government that obeys the law.”

But now that they're gone, many experts and analysts expect a downturn in the market—at least for a while. Predictions we've reported on range from ""a speed bump"" to ""a dangerous drop in investments that would keep the U.S. competitive with Europe and China.""

To learn more, my co-host Tim Levin and I spoke to Elaine Buckberg, who is a Senior Fellow at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability. She's also the former Chief Economist of General Motors and a former senior U.S. Treasury official, so she's well-versed in the entire EV tax credit system, why it happened, where it was successful—and where it fell short.

One thing she cited as a miss for the credit: the leasing loophole, which was primarily designed to get corporate fleets into EVs but ultimately led more than 1 million people (including me, for transparency's sake) to net super-cheap lease deals. Why was that a bad thing?

""It undermined EV purchasing,"" Buckberg told us. ""Put income caps, put price caps on the tax credit instead. Why should we subsidize someone who's going to make the purchase anyway? We're trying to catalyze marginal purchases. If you ask me what to do to make the policy cheaper, I would have closed the lease loophole and not eliminated the credit.""

The initial agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank concerns the project’s 290MW solar component.
It features a tax equity contribution at the commercial operation date (COD) and additional pay-go payments during the first 10 years of operation.
The second agreement with M&T Bank and First Citizens Bank offers tax equity financing for the 940 MWh storage component at COD.
A representative for Enlight confirmed with ESN that the US$320 million tax equity funding has increased to US$340 million.","Situated on private land in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, New Mexico, the Milagro solar-plus-storage project is designed to store electricity generated during peak hours in a series of batteries.

EDF stated that the project created around 200 jobs at peak construction and is expected to generate approximately US$18 million in tax revenue for Doña Ana County and its school districts, supported by the Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB).

New Mexico has actively promoted BESS development. In 2023, the state Senate approved legislation requiring investor-owned utilities to operate 2GW/7GWh of energy storage by 2034.

As reported this week by Energy-Storage.news Premium, Investor-owned utility Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) is requesting authorisation from the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) to develop a new portfolio of eight self-build energy projects.

The portfolio features two BESS projects with a combined capacity of 472MW/1.88GWh, one in New Mexico and one in Texas, along with new solar, wind, and fossil gas facilities. SPS is pursuing expedited regulatory approval for these new assets to address what it describes as a “significant capacity deficit.”

In March, EPE and EDF also announced operations of the 10MW Chihuahuan Desert solar facility in San Elizario, Texas, as part of the Texas Community Solar programme.

In August, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) acquired full ownership of EDF’s 1GWh Beehive BESS in Arizona. That project also has a 20-year tolling agreement with Arizona utility Arizona Public Service Company.

Enlight secures US$340 million for 940MWh Arizona project

Also happening in Arizona, IPP Enlight Renewable Energy has closed two tax equity partnerships totalling nearly US$340 million for its 290MWdc/940MWh solar-plus-storage Roadrunner project.

The agreements were closed through Enlight’s US subsidiary Clēnera Holdings.

The initial agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank concerns the project’s 290MW solar component. It features a tax equity contribution at the commercial operation date (COD) and additional pay-go payments during the first 10 years of operation.

The second agreement with M&T Bank and First Citizens Bank offers tax equity financing for the 940 MWh storage component at COD.

Together, the two partnerships account for about US$340 million in tax equity commitments at COD, with expectations to rise to nearly US$390 million when pay-go contributions are included.

In December 2024, ESN reported on Enlight’s announced financing for Roadrunner, which totalled US$550 million.

That financing was split between a US$290 million term loan and US$320 million of tax equity funding on the project’s commercial operation date (COD).

A representative for Enlight confirmed with ESN that the US$320 million tax equity funding has increased to US$340 million.

All procurement contracts for Roadrunner are signed. The project has a 20-year busbar PPA with utility Arizona Electric Power Cooperative (AEPCO).

Roadrunner now involves a total investment of US$621 million. Enlight says the solar generation component has initiated production of test energy, and the project is expected to achieve full commercial operation by the end of 2025.

Once fully operational, it is expected to generate annual revenues exceeding US$50 million in its first full year of operation and EBITDA of approximately US$40 million.

The company also anticipates that the solar component will benefit from Production Tax Credits (PTC), while the storage component is expected to receive Investment Tax Credits (ITC). Additionally, the project is projected to qualify for the 10% Energy Community Adder.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Milagro.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:11:22.472297

The U.S. Department of Energy broke the law last month when officials attempted to cap the amount of federal funding states could receive to cover the staff and administrative costs of sustainable energy and energy efficiency projects, a federal judge found.

Federal Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 18 other Democratic attorneys general who sued the U.S. Department of Energy and its leader, Chris Wright, in August over attempts to cut funding for such projects. Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal energy department.

Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench and no written order has yet been filed with the court.

States argued that a new federal energy department rule mandating that “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — cannot exceed 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations. Officials from the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.

The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.

Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.

“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”

Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.

Rayfield was joined in the latest suit by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/SolarInstallJBHouse1-2048x1536-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 11:00:29.792110

""When North Carolina’s GOP-led legislature nixed a key decarbonization deadline for Duke Energy in July, critics feared it would upend the state’s transition to clean energy.

Now, a proposal Duke just submitted to regulators shows they were right to worry as the utility, North Carolina’s largest, seeks to walk back its clean-energy ambitions and enact one of the most aggressive fossil-fuel expansions in the nation.

Without a mandate to cut climate-warming emissions 70% from 2005 levels by 2030, the utility intends to build about half as much wind and solar capacity over the next decade compared to its previous trajectory. It also now aims to delay the construction of new nuclear power plants until later in the 2030s. Battery storage is the sole bright spot for clean energy in the blueprint — Duke wants to invest in about 1.5 gigawatts more than it did before.

Meanwhile, the company proposes to extend the life of aging coal plants and develop more natural-gas units, bringing its total build-out of new fossil-fuel plants to 9.7 gigawatts by 2035 and as much as 12.3 gigawatts by 2040.""",https://www.sej.org/sites/default/files/default_images/logo200x200_3.png,N,,2025-10-03 13:03:06.574941

The Port Authority is also studying whether hydrogen power could play a role in the transition.
Port Authority engages the next generation Mitchell also sees education as key to building a more sustainable maritime sector.
Through a partnership with the Detroit River Story Lab, the Port Authority co-hosts an annual career expo that introduces students to jobs in shipping and logistics.
“The Detroit River has always been a place for family,” she said.","This story was produced in collaboration with the Detroit River Story Lab, a University of Michigan initiative that supports local efforts to center the river as a site of connection and belonging. The Lab’s local journalism portfolio includes the Detroit River Stories podcast series, the 100 Years Ago Today blog, and the Detroit River Beat, a collection of student-authored stories about the river’s role in sustaining human and more-than-human communities throughout the region.

Taylor Mitchell grew up asking whether the fish and birds in the Detroit River were safe. As a child, she spent time on Belle Isle with her family and wondered what pollution meant for the wildlife she saw around her.

Now, as the Detroit Wayne County Port Authority’s first sustainability manager, Mitchell is leading efforts to cut diesel emissions from port operations that have long polluted neighborhoods like Delray.

Mitchell oversees the Authority’s Decarbonization and Air Quality Improvement Plan, which sets a goal of bringing 23 private terminals along the Detroit and Rouge rivers to net zero emissions by 2040. Much of that work focuses on reducing carbon emissions from diesel-powered trucks, ships, cranes, and other equipment used to move freight.

“I’m trying to be the voice of sustainability in a space that may not be ready to transition,” Mitchell said. “But I’m hoping others can see the benefit of this work, and that our government can contribute to the shift toward sustainable practices.”

From Detroit roots to career in sustainability

Mitchell’s path to this role reflects both local roots and national experience. She graduated from Grosse Pointe North High School before attending North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, a historically Black college, where she studied environmental science.

Mitchell later earned a master’s degree in sustainable systems at the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability.

Leaving Detroit for college gave Mitchell perspective, but coming back gave her purpose, she said.

“I love Detroit and was able to grow a lot here and develop the foundation for who I am, but leaving the state and attending an HBCU was pivotal,” she said. “I was able to really grow and develop as a scientist and a leader.”

Mitchell returned to her home state, where she attended University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability to obtain her master’s degree with a focus on sustainable systems.

In graduate school, Mitchell said she immersed herself in big-picture ideas about climate solutions.

“As a student, you get to dream big about how you are going to fix these issues and envision the impact you’re going to have,” she said. Now, working in government, she sees the real-life obstacles — funding, politics, and limited resources.

“I am trying to be the voice of sustainability in a space that may not be ready to transition,” she said. “But I am hoping that others can see the benefit of this work and also that our government can contribute to the assistance of transitioning over to sustainable practices.”

Port Authority builds momentum with federal funds

Mitchell’s position comes at a pivotal moment for the Port Authority, which recently received $24.9 million from the EPA’s Clean Ports Program. The funding will cover the cost of electric forklifts, gantry cranes, and other low-emission equipment at private terminals. It marks the authority’s first significant push to decarbonize freight operations in the Detroit region.

The Port Authority is also studying whether hydrogen power could play a role in the transition. Officials are exploring how hydrogen could be used in a maritime setting and what role Detroit might play in a broader statewide move toward hydrogen fuel.

To keep momentum, Mitchell helped form a Low Carbon Port Committee, where terminal operators share sustainability goals and discuss ways the authority can support them. “Some of the private companies we work with have been super engaged and very excited about this work,” she said.

While collaboration with private companies is key, Mitchell said much of her role also involves making complex sustainability issues understandable to a wide range of audiences.

“I won’t assume that even the government official or private terminal owner understands all of these concepts,” she explains, “but taking the pressure away and focusing on potential impacts keeps people engaged and interested in what it means to live in a clean, green world.”

Mitchell’s personal connection to portside pollution

For Mitchell, the work is more than technical. She has family ties to Delray, one of Detroit’s most heavily polluted neighborhoods, located next to the port and I-75.

“If we aren’t thinking about the people impacted by the port’s pollution, then what are we doing this for?” she said.

Studies have shown that residents of port-adjacent communities face higher risks of asthma and other health problems due to diesel exhaust and industrial emissions. Environmental health advocates have long pressed government agencies and industry leaders to do more.

Mitchell said that perspective shapes how she approaches her work. “Community members know air quality. They’ve lived through it for a long time. They know more about the day-to-day experience than I do. My role is to come into the room as both a teacher and a student.”

Equity, accountability on the river

Mitchell prioritizes open communication between the Port Authority and surrounding neighborhoods. She said she often slows down technical discussions to keep them accessible for residents and decision-makers alike.

“I won’t assume that even a government official or private terminal owner understands all of these concepts,” she said. “Taking the pressure away and focusing on potential impacts keeps people engaged.”

She said some of her most rewarding experiences have been meeting with residents who express cautious optimism about pollution-mitigation projects. “Knowing how this community has been historically impacted by industry and being able to engage with them is my favorite part of this job,” she said.

Port Authority engages the next generation

Mitchell also sees education as key to building a more sustainable maritime sector. Through a partnership with the Detroit River Story Lab, the Port Authority co-hosts an annual career expo that introduces students to jobs in shipping and logistics.

“People just don’t know about the maritime industry and the opportunities that exist — like working on a laker vessel and traveling the Great Lakes,” she said.

Other public events highlight the Detroit River’s role in the region’s history and economy. “Many people who live right along the river may not know the impact it has had on our state and country,” Mitchell said. “Learning that history builds pride and a stronger sense of connection.”

For her, that connection is personal. “The Detroit River has always been a place for family,” she said. “Just looking at the river and being there made us feel connected to it and to each other.”

The audit pointed to ""the potential for favoritism and misuse of public funds"" — but also detailed reforms already taking place.

The forensic audit, conducted by FTI Consulting, was prompted by a series of internal investigations conducted by the Braun administration and a report from the Hannah News Service published in April — it detailed allegations of ethics violations and self-dealing by staffers employed by IEDC-affiliated organizations, including Elevate Ventures.

The 127-page forensic audit detailed no criminal allegations. And it called the ongoing reform efforts a ""positive step towards enhancing transparency and accountability.""

Indiana Economic Development Corporation

The audit highlighted specific issues in the IEDC's policies on confidentiality and conflicts of interest, as well as transparency and accountability for the management of state funds by IEDC-affiliated organizations.

When FTI Consulting cross-checked conflict-of-interest forms with employment history, it found at least 10 instances that went unreported. The audit also found 30 entities that received IEDC funding and were connected to an IEDC board member or employee. Only one was reported to the Indiana State Ethics Commission.

One example of a potential conflict of interest involved the IEDC's former chief innovation officer. Dave Roberts left to become CEO of the Applied Research Institute in 2022. Upon his departure, the audit said Roberts did not obtain a post-employment waiver from the state ethics commission.

The audit said more than 80 percent of Roberts's salary was related to an IEDC contract and indicates a ""potential violation of post-employment restrictions."" Roberts was replaced as CEO during the review.

FTI Consulting also found the IEDC ""does not consistently apply due diligence procedures or competitive bidding processes to assess third-party vendors prior to contracting."" It highlighted Pure Development's selection for the state's controversial LEAP district.

Indiana Economic Development Foundation

The audit also found a ""symbiotic relationship"" between the IEDC and donors to its nonprofit arm, the Indiana Economic Development Foundation. Of the foundation's 107 donors during the review period, 46 received payments or tax credits from the IEDC.

The audit found that IEDC staff had a waiver process ""to ensure there is no quid pro quo"" — but was provided no documentation of that process during the audit.

The audit also highlighted travel expenses it calls ""excessive in nature."" All travel for the foundation and the IEDC were paid by the foundation and reimbursed by the IEDC. During the review period, that totaled more than $13.4 million.

The foundation paid more than $86,000 for international car race tickets and events. An IEDC trip to the COP27 conference in Egypt in 2022 budgeted $90,000 in airfare costs. The audit reported ""the credit card expenses suggest actual airfare costs incurred for the trip were at least $200,000.""

Elevate Ventures

When announcing the forensic audit, Gov. Mike Braun also announced funds allocated to Elevate Ventures would be frozen ""until further evaluation.""

The audit said ""the IEDC's limited communication with and governance of EV, along with a lack of transparency into EV investment level details, contributed to an environment that increased the risk that state and federal funds were being used in a manner that was inconsistent with their stated purpose.""

It also said Elevate Ventures had ""already taken significant steps"" to address the issues identified in the audit, including a comprehensive investment return reconciliation project for the state's 21 Fund. The fund was created by the Indiana legislature in 1999 to ""stimulate the transfer of research and technology into marketable products, diversify Indiana's economy by focusing investment in high technology industry clusters, and encourage an environment of innovation and cooperation among universities and businesses.""",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_pHof4a4l.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:12:23.241737

Critical minerals are characterised as materials which have economic and strategic significance to a particular country.
There is no universal definition for critical minerals.
Critical minerals have become extremely crucial for new emerging technologies.
In 2023, India joined the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a group committed to building a secure supply chain for critical minerals.","The transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) is considered to be one of the most fundamental transformations the automotive industry has faced in decades. The EVs are seen as a key technological innovation for reducing CO2 emissions related to the transport sector. The transport sector accounts for about 23 percent of global life-cycle CO₂ emissions (8.8 Gt), with road transport making up the largest portion (6.5 Gt). Electric vehicles are considered to be a crucial technology that would help in the abatement of carbon emissions. They are considered to be cleaner than ICE vehicles over their lifetime. Several countries have announced targets to phase out ICE vehicles by the year 2050. Considerable literature exists on how various countries have promoted the use of electric vehicles. Norway is one country that has achieved a high level of EV penetration.

A major consequence of the current energy transition is the increasing competition over critical minerals for renewable energy technologies. Critical minerals are the foundational inputs driving the clean energy transition. “Critical materials” is a broad term which is used to refer to those minerals which have no viable substitutes, and the importing countries are open to supply chain risks as the supply is dominated by one or a few countries. Critical minerals are characterised as materials which have economic and strategic significance to a particular country. They are typically linked with a low degree of substitutability, high supply risk and their production is concentrated in a few countries. There is no universal definition for critical minerals.

Critical minerals have become extremely crucial for new emerging technologies. Industries like automobile, electronics, manufacturing, defence, and aerospace today depend significantly on these minerals.

Minerals are formed as part of the process of long geological events, spanning over millions of years and are hence a finite resource. Critical minerals have become extremely crucial for new emerging technologies. Industries like automobile, electronics, manufacturing, defence, and aerospace today depend significantly on these minerals. A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that to achieve the net-zero emission targets globally by 2050, the mineral requirement would be almost six times the current inputs. A major portion of mineral reserves exists in developing countries. Recently, the geopolitical supply risks of these critical minerals have increased. The cobalt supply disruption in the 1970s due to political upheaval in DRC and Chinese export curbs on Rare Earth Elements (REEs) in 2010-11 are a few examples of supply risks. After the Chinese disruption in 2010, as a response, governments looked for other suppliers. As a result, the Chinese share of REEs production dropped from 97 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2014.

The Chinese have been accused of rent-seeking behaviour. The “ minerals for infrastructure” deal between the Chinese government and the government of the DRC is cited as an example of this behaviour. Chinese state banks provided loans to DRC for infrastructure in exchange for developmental rights of copper and cobalt mines. The Chinese have been able to increase their share in the global supply of critical minerals due to cheap labour, less stringent environmental regulations, and cheaper extraction of metals.The extent of Chinese dominance can be gauged from the fact that China processes 68 percent of global nickel, 40 percent of copper, 59 percent of lithium, and 73 percent of cobalt. Notably, in 2023, nearly 60 percent of global EV sales were in China, with the EU and the US following with 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

The extent of Chinese dominance can be gauged from the fact that China processes 68 percent of global nickel, 40 percent of copper, 59 percent of lithium, and 73 percent of cobalt.

The structure of the Chinese economy and the scale of its processing sector make China a low-cost supplier of processed minerals. As per the USGS report of 2022, 85 percent of rare earth and around 60 to 70 percent of lithium and cobalt are refined by China. This prolonged experience has provided China with significant advantages in processing these minerals. Since 2020, the EU and the US have looked to counter the offshoring of minerals with policies aimed at strengthening domestic jobs. The Inflation Reduction Act in the US highlights clean energy and infrastructure development. The EU’s Green Deal Industrial Plan frames itself as a growth strategy.

India’s Challenge and Opportunity

The Government of India has a target of achieving a share of electric vehicle sales of “30 per cent in private cars, 70 per cent in commercial vehicles, 40 per cent in buses, and 80 per cent in two-wheelers and three-wheelers by 2030”. India is actively engaging in international partnerships, such as the Quad, to frame rules and norms for clean energy supply chains. It has been in talks with countries like Australia, which are rich in critical mineral resources. In 2023, India joined the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a group committed to building a secure supply chain for critical minerals.

However, India needs to enhance exploration within its territory and upgrade existing technology to explore subsurface deposits. India spends a negligible amount compared to China, the US and several others. While using EVs may contribute to lower emissions, when taking into account the manufacturing of EVs, emissions could be much higher than those of conventional ICE vehicles. A study found that emissions from electric vehicle manufacturing during the battery manufacturing phase negate any reduction achieved by EVs, unless the source of electricity generation is shifted from coal to renewable energy sources. A typical EV requires six times the mineral inputs when compared to a conventional car. Hybrid vehicles offer a medium-term alternative during the transition to electric vehicles.

A study found that emissions from electric vehicle manufacturing during the battery manufacturing phase negate any reduction achieved by EVs, unless the source of electricity generation is shifted from coal to renewable energy sources.

For India, securing reliable and affordable access to these minerals is not just a matter of industrial policy but also that of energy security. The global value chains remain heavily concentrated and are vulnerable to geopolitical tensions. India should enhance South-South cooperation, as it is the only developing country present in forums like MSP. It is imperative that India speaks for the Global South and ensures access and affordability of critical minerals, resists exploitative and extractivist market practices, and promotes stability and predictability in global supply chains. A coherent policy approach must focus on three themes: diversifying imports through strategic alliances, investing in domestic exploration and processing, and blending renewable energy into the EV value chain. Electric Vehicles are going to alter the geopolitics of the world.

What Is American Resources' Investment Narrative?

For those considering American Resources as an investment, the big picture is all about whether you buy into the company’s long-term ambition to scale up refining and recycling capabilities in the U.S. critical materials supply chain. The recent expansion of the Marion, Indiana Supersite and the long-term partnership between ReElement Technologies and POSCO International America Corp signal tangible progress toward greater operational scale, which could change how short-term catalysts are viewed, particularly in terms of commercialization milestones and customer adoption. Historically, the company has faced financial hurdles, ongoing losses, and compliance challenges, including SEC filing delays and Nasdaq notifications. While these recent moves add commercial momentum and may ease some near-term risks around revenue generation, they do not eliminate the material concerns around profitability, negative equity, and cash runway. Investors need to weigh whether these catalysts now meaningfully offset the risks that have pressured shares, especially given the company’s history of volatility and funding uncertainties.

But despite these growth signals, lingering compliance and financial risks remain front of mind for investors. indicates American Resources may be overvalued.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Among the five community fair value estimates submitted to the Simply Wall St Community, projections span from as little as US$0.0035 to over US$41,800, illustrating just how wide investor opinions can be. With such divergent perspectives, the latest Supersite expansion and partnership may drive future debate, especially as concerns over ongoing losses and the need for reliable financial reporting sit in the background.

Joe Biden’s dubiously-labelled Inflation Reduction Act unleashed vast amounts of federal subsidies to incentivise “clean” energy production.
It has also meant that the US has not followed Europe and the UK, locking itself into a single, economically calamitous energy policy.
According to the Clean Energy States Alliance, about half of all states are pursuing some sort of net zero or “clean” energy goal, mostly in the Northeast or on the West Coast.
Perhaps if they are to prosper, they need not only an American style of energy policy.","Why does the US manage to produce cheaper energy? It’s not as though the laws of physics are any different on the other side of the Atlantic. Nor has there been any shortage of US leaders determined to adopt the kind of renewable energy targets that have done so much to disrupt UK energy markets.

Federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission set national standards, while Congress has passed a series of laws to determine the overall national approach. Joe Biden’s dubiously-labelled Inflation Reduction Act unleashed vast amounts of federal subsidies to incentivise “clean” energy production.

But states retain significant control over their own energy mix and there is no single “net zero” law that must be followed across the nation. This has allowed, in the words of Louis Brandeis, a Supreme Court justice in the early 20th century, the US states to act as laboratories, trying out different approaches. It has also meant that the US has not followed Europe and the UK, locking itself into a single, economically calamitous energy policy.

According to the Clean Energy States Alliance, about half of all states are pursuing some sort of net zero or “clean” energy goal, mostly in the Northeast or on the West Coast. The other half, especially some Southern states but also the likes of Pennsylvania, have chosen a different approach, tending to prioritise energy production over emissions reductions.

The effects of this difference in approach are stark. Many of the states that are committed to phasing out oil, gas and coal are discovering that the so-called energy “transition” is not as easy as it’s been made out. Like Britain, some have ended up having to rely on imports to fulfil their energy needs. They are not importing energy from hostile foreign states, however. They are getting it from the likes of Pennsylvania, which was by far the top exporter of electricity to other states in 2023.

Differences in policy have, unsurprisingly, begun to show up in prices. According to official figures, in July, the average price of electricity for households was 26.18 cents per kilowatt hour (KWh) in New York (which is rushing to approve new renewable projects), 30.07c per KWh in Massachusetts (a net zero by 2050 state) and 32.58c per KWh in California (one of the nation’s so-called leaders in green policy). It was only 19.52c per KWh in Pennsylvania (rich in natural gas), 15.12c in Florida (which has been repealing renewable goals), and 13.46c in my home state of Mississippi (which is prioritising overall energy security to drive growth).

This cannot help but to influence decisions on where people want to live and where corporations want to do business. Yes, parts of the United States have suffered from deindustrialisation. But those jobs and factories have not necessarily moved to Mexico or China. Many have shifted South. In July, average industrial electricity prices were 18.06c per KWh in New England, but only 6.60c per KWh in Texas and 7.47c in Mississippi.

It is not just traditional heavy industry that stands to lose when energy costs are inflated in the pursuit of emissions targets. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is extremely energy-intensive, and it is hard to see how places without affordable energy will be able to build the AI infrastructure needed to remain competitive. In the US, Arizona has emerged as a leading location for data centres, and for good reason. Even the Left-wing media admits that the industry is booming in the state thanks to lower energy costs.

This doesn’t mean that renewables are entirely inappropriate forms of energy everywhere. A state like Texas, for example, has become among the nation’s leading producers of solar and wind, although questions remain about how much is sustainable without taxpayer subsidy. But it has done so without sacrificing other, more reliable forms of energy. Texas remains America’s largest oil-producing state.

To quote Justice Brandeis fully, he spoke about states being laboratories that would allow ideas to be tested “without risk to the rest of the country”. When it comes to energy policy, we can see precisely this.

America allows the iron-clad certainties of the renewable lobby to be tested by reality. Indeed, the country works so well because it has been built on the assumption that we cannot know for certain what approach will prove best. America is, to borrow the ungainly phrase coined by Friedrich Hayek, built on “evolutionary rationalism”, the idea that the right answer emerges through trial and error.

Europe and Britain have worse policies on energy and much else because they are governed by what Hayek called constructive rationalism, the assumption that we can build the best by deliberate design. Perhaps if they are to prosper, they need not only an American style of energy policy. They need a system of governance that allows trial and error. The alternative will be perpetual mistakes.

“North Plains Connector will be the first transmission system connecting three major U.S. energy markets, supporting a key goal of the U.S. Department of Energy for interregional transmission connections to enhance grid reliability and resilience,” said Allie Wahrenberger, vice president of Engineering for Grid United.
In July, notably, the Trump administration halted a $4.9 billion loan commitment for the Grain Belt Express, an HVDC project intended to connect wind and solar across Kansas and Missouri.","Hitachi Energy and high-voltage interregional infrastructure developer Grid United have launched the next phase of a collaboration to strengthen transmission capacity between three energy markets straddling the Eastern and Western grids in the U.S., formalizing an agreement for the North Plains Connector (NPC), a ±525 kV, 3-GW high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) line spanning roughly 420 miles between Montana and North Dakota.

The Engineering Services Agreement (ESA), announced Oct. 2, 2025, tasks Hitachi Energy with delivering early-stage engineering services—including technical specifications for two HVDC converter stations, covering electrical ratings, valve hall layouts, control-system architecture, and harmonic mitigation studies. It also includes dynamic and steady-state system modeling and AC–DC interface definitions for integration with Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC).

Grid United will advance corridor refinement, land-rights acquisition, stakeholder engagement, environmental permitting support, and supply-chain sequencing for long-lead items such as transformers, smoothing reactors, and converter valves. Procurement timelines will be aligned with the project’s permitting and construction schedule.

Bridging the Crucial East-West Gap

The project marks a significant advance for Hitachi Energy’s ambitions to bridge the Eastern and Western electrical interconnections, which federal studies have long identified as one of the nation’s most consequential grid vulnerabilities. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) October 2024 National Transmission Planning (NTP) Study found that “significantly more transmission needs to be built in the U.S.—roughly two to three times the current transmission system—to meet future demand growth, reliability requirements, and achieve existing and potential future public policy goals.” That expansion, the study said, would “enhance grid reliability as it allows more resources to be shared across regions and energy to be moved from where it is available to where it is needed,” particularly during “large-scale extreme weather events.”

A crucial structural gap, according to a January 2025 study from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), stems from the grid’s topology: the U.S. lacks coordinated interregional transmission planning and physical transfer capacity between its major electrical interconnections. The report found “a lack of comprehensive, multi-value interregional transmission planning processes… and no planning organization or authority responsible for interregional transmission planning.” It also concludes that “improving interregional transmission can enhance grid reliability as it allows more resources to be shared across regions and energy to be moved from where it is available to where it is needed.” That isolation, the authors caution, heightens system congestion, curtails low-cost renewable power in the Plains and Interior West, and undermines resilience “during large-scale extreme weather events,” when the ability to shift power between regions could avert outages and lower costs.

According to Hitachi Energy and Grid United, the NPC is designed to address that deficiency. The ±525-kV HVDC system will link eastern Montana and western North Dakota to create a controllable, bidirectional bridge between the WECC, MISO, and SPP to transport up to 3 GW in either direction between the eastern and western U.S. “NPC will help address fast-growing electricity demand driven by AI data centers and industrial electrification. It will play a key role in enabling the sharing of power between grids serving different parts of the country,” the companies said on Thursday.

The ESA builds on the companies’ first landmark announcement about the concept in March 2024. That announcement outlined a plan for Hitachi Energy to provide HVDC technology across multiple Grid United transmission projects. The companies framed the effort as a way to “dramatically boost transmission capacity across the U.S. to support the urgent need for smooth sharing of power between energy markets at a time of drastically increasing demand for electricity,” while “help[ing] overcome one of the most persistent bottlenecks in the energy transition in the U.S. by bridging the east–west divide.”

That 2024 collaboration, notably, also introduced a novel capacity reservation framework that allows Hitachi Energy to pre-allocate manufacturing capacity and streamline delivery across successive HVDC projects. Hitachi has said the mechanism echoes a business model the company had previously applied with European utilities to accelerate transmission build-out. Hitachi Energy executives characterized the approach as a supply chain innovation designed to “enable speed and scale in the supply chain” and “make important contributions to streamlining the development process to help accelerate the energy transition.”

Interregional HVDC Link Promises Major Reliability Gains

According to Grid United’s North Plains Connector website, the line is “entering the permitting phase and initiating regulatory filings, with approvals expected in 2026.” Construction could begin in 2028, and the line is expected to be operational in 2032. The company also notes that it is “coordinating with local utilities for long term operation and maintenance of the transmission line.”

In August 2024, the $3.2 billion HVDC project was selected to receive $700 million by the Biden administration under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. The DOE’s website indicates those funds have been awarded with a recipient cost share of $2.8 billion.

While the project is designed to be technology agnostic and bidirectional, a June 2024 independent reliability evaluation conducted by Astrapé Consulting and reviewed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that the North Plains Connector could deliver substantial reliability benefits across interconnections, with an effective load-carrying capability (ELCC) totaling roughly 3,550 MW (ceeding the project’s 3,000-MW transfer rating because of complementary seasonal load diversity).

The study found the project “provides significant reliability benefit in all zones” and quantified its value at about 1,800 MW for WECC—primarily from winter reliability improvements—and 1,350 MW and 400 MW for SPP and MISO, respectively, tied to summer peaks. Astrapé attributed those benefits to the ability of the project’s east–west connection to take advantage of regional diversity in seasonal loads and resources, which could reduce the probability of simultaneous shortfalls and increase the effective reliability of all three systems.

According to Grid United, the project could also respond rapidly to peak demand, extreme weather events, and dynamic load shifts between the Eastern and Western Interconnections. It noted that in addition to increasing demand, “at least three primary factors affect the ability of the U.S.’s electrical grid to reliably deliver energy to consumers and are hastening the need for significant transmission infrastructure investment.”

“Changes in public policy are reducing reliable baseload generation, rapid changes in the generation resource portfolio mix are affecting reliability, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events are impacting system reliability,” it says. “This high-capacity, bidirectional connection into regional generation and transmission hubs is intended to improve reliability and resiliency across both Interconnections by increasing transfer capacity and access to additional generation in new markets, and by providing the ability to shift power quickly and efficiently to address peak demand or extreme weather events.”

Still, while the ESA represents a key step forward in development, it does not constitute a final investment decision. Under the ESA, Hitachi Energy will deliver early-stage engineering services, including the development of technical specifications for the HVDC converter stations. “This approach reduces project risk, enables proactive supply chain management, and accelerates and streamlines project execution,” Hitachi noted.

A Historic Project—And Other Efforts to Bridge the Divide

On Thursday, company officials hailed the historic nature of the project. “North Plains Connector will be the first transmission system connecting three major U.S. energy markets, supporting a key goal of the U.S. Department of Energy for interregional transmission connections to enhance grid reliability and resilience,” said Allie Wahrenberger, vice president of Engineering for Grid United. “We are excited to be moving forward with world-class engineering from Hitachi Energy, a company committed to our shared goal of improving grid reliability and resilience for millions of Americans.”

“This new agreement with Grid United is a perfect example of how a long-term collaboration built on trust and a shared vision can accelerate the project and mitigate risk,” said Nathanael Occenad, Vice President, Regional HVDC Sales Manager for the Americas of Hitachi Energy. “We are proud to support Grid United to advance this project, which is so critical to the expansion of the U.S. grid in the face of skyrocketing electricity demand.”

The project, however, isn’t the first to explore bridging the East-West gap. The Tres Amigas Project, a project unveiled in 2009 by New Mexico’s then-governor, Bill Richardson, sought to unite the Eastern, Western, and Texas Interconnections with superconductor electricity “pipelines” (which combine conventional underground pipeline construction with DC superconductor power transmission cables and multi-terminal (voltage-source) AC/DC power converters). While the 73-mile, 345-kV, 750 MW–capacity line project received DOE seed grants and early engineering, it faltered in 2015 when Xcel subsidiary Southwestern Public Service (the Eastern grid gateway) withdrew its interconnection agreement, leaving ERCOT unwilling to join under FERC jurisdiction. Efforts that followed to downsize the project’s scope and revise business models failed to regain momentum, and the project ceased in 2017. Its demise, however, echoed key barriers—fragmented regulatory authority, uncertain offtake commitments, and high upfront costs—that have hampered the large-scale build out of transmission infrastructure for decades.

Efforts to bridge the East-West divide appear to be burgeoning—again—under the pressure of AI-driven load growth and industrial electrification. The Biden administration’s National Transmission Planning Study and PNNL’s interregional pathways analysis have identified multiple ±500 kV HVDC corridors—including NPC—as critical to unlocking resource diversity and cutting congestion costs by up to $490 billion through 2050. The Trump administration’s July 2025 America’s AI Action Plan directs federal agencies to enhance the efficiency and performance of the existing transmission system through advanced line upgrades and incentives, but it does not explicitly endorse or call for new HVDC corridors. In July, notably, the Trump administration halted a $4.9 billion loan commitment for the Grain Belt Express, an HVDC project intended to connect wind and solar across Kansas and Missouri.

IN THE NEWS

Congress failed to approve government funding legislation by its October 1 deadline, resulting in a shutdown. During this funding lapse, mandatory spending such as social security benefits and postal services will continue, and “essential” federal employees will remain at work unpaid but entitled to later backpay, while other employees are furloughed, or placed on a temporary, unpaid leave. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office reported that about 750,000 employees could be furloughed, although Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought reportedly suggested that the Administration would permanently fire some federal employees in lieu of furloughs. Vought previously directed federal agencies to identify programs “not consistent with the President’s priorities” and prepare plans for permanent firings in the event of a shutdown.

The U.S. Supreme Court deferred the Trump Administration’s request to immediately remove Lisa Cook from her position as member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Court’s order allows Cook to participate in upcoming Federal Reserve meetings and delays any change in control of its board. The Court set oral arguments for January 2026 to consider whether President Donald J. Trump may fire Cook for alleged mortgage fraud before she joined the Federal Reserve. Lower courts have blocked President Trump’s firing attempt, finding that his allegations likely do not satisfy the law’s “for cause” requirement that there be evidence of wrongdoing to justify a dismissal.

The Trump Administration announced a coordinated plan between several agencies to open 13.1 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to upgrade or recommission coal plants around the country. The U.S. Department of the Interior will open the federal lands and lower the rates companies must pay to extract coal. The U.S Department of Energy will provide the grants to extend the lifespan of existing coal plants and improve electricity reliability. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will delay deadlines for coal-fired power plants to comply with wastewater pollution limits. This coordinated plan follows an executive order issued by President Trump earlier this year aimed at boosting the coal industry.

The Trump Administration announced a deal with Pfizer to sell its drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices through a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, set to launch in 2026. Under the agreement, Pfizer pledged to match prices for new drugs in the United States to those in other developed countries and extend similar price-matching terms to Medicaid. Experts cautioned, however, that savings may be limited because discounts apply only to uninsured patients and are based on high list prices. In return for the deal, the Trump Administration granted Pfizer a three-year exemption from proposed tariffs.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommended barring Harvard University from receiving federal funding or entering into contracts with the federal government. HHS’s Office for Civil Rights previously claimed that Harvard had acted with “deliberate indifference” toward discrimination against Jewish and Israeli students. HHS began formal administrative proceedings to decide if Harvard will be deemed ineligible for federal funds and stated that the university has 20 days to notify the agency if it will exercise its right to a hearing. Suspension and exclusion from funding and contracts apply across all agencies.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland sued to stop President Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, an action the President characterized as protecting the city, and particularly U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, from “domestic terrorists.” The lawsuit accuses the President of federalizing the Oregon National Guard for the illegal purpose of civilian law enforcement and of trampling constitutional principles by singling out “politically disfavored jurisdictions” for retribution. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the deployment in a memo directing U.S. Attorneys in the District of Oregon to prosecute “every person suspected of threatening or assaulting a federal law enforcement officer” to the greatest extent possible.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new generic version of the abortion pill, clearing a drug manufacturer to sell tablets of mifepristone that are equivalent to the long-available drug Mifeprex. The move is expected to expand access to medication abortions, which make up about two-thirds of all U.S. abortions. The approval produced sharp criticism from anti-abortion groups and Republican lawmakers, who urged the Trump Administration to reverse policies that allow abortion pills to be distributed by mail.

A new California law strengthens protections for employee whistleblowers at major AI companies and requires companies to disclose their safety protocols and report critical safety incidents. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who vetoed a stricter AI bill last year, commended the new law in a public letter. Newsom stated that future AI regulation will involve collaboration with the federal government, and the new law allows federal regulations to replace some of its own provisions in certain cases.

A federal court ruled in favor of Meta, ending a lawsuit that alleged that the company misled Facebook users about its privacy protections. The plaintiffs argued that although Facebook is free to use, they were nonetheless financially harmed by Meta’s misrepresentations because if users had known what data they were providing, Meta would have paid users $5.00 per months in a competitive market to access that data. U.S. District Judge James Donato rejected the plaintiffs’ expert testimony in support of this theory, ending the lawsuit. Meta still faces a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging that the company strategically acquired competitors such as Instagram and WhatsApp to maintain a monopoly on personal social networking.

WHAT WE’RE READING THIS WEEK

In a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, Cavit Baran, a professor at Sabancı University, and several coauthors examined the effect of electric vehicle use on air quality and child health. Using county-level data from 2010 to 2021, the Baran team compared electric vehicle registrations to levels of nitrogen dioxide—a harmful pollutant linked to vehicle emissions—and several health measures including low infant birth weights, preterm births, and asthma-related emergency department visits. Baran and his coauthors found that a one-unit increase in electric vehicles per 1,000 vehicles led to significant declines in pollutant levels and reduced negative child health outcomes. They recommended increasing investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage adoption of electric vehicles and further improve health.

In an essay in the Yale Journal on Regulation, Raúl Carrillo, Academic Fellow at Columbia Law School, examined how financial technology (“fintech”) companies such as Venmo, Cash App, and other “platform money” providers rely on data collection systems that expose consumers to risks they cannot reasonably avoid. He explained that data brokers gather detailed personal and financial information, often without users’ knowledge, and sell it to fintech firms that use it to shape credit decisions, advertising, and financial services. Carrillo argued that this “data maximization” model makes financial services more invasive and less secure, producing harms ranging from privacy violations to identity theft and discrimination. He contended that outdated U.S. financial data laws leave consumers vulnerable and called for stronger rules based on data minimization which would limit the collection and use of personal data.[Sean]: A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report examined the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) effectiveness at addressing sexual harassment in federally funded research institutions. In 2022, Congress directed OSTP to inventory institutions’ policies, issue guidance for improvement, and ensure compliance by October 3, 2025. The new report, however, found that OSTP-issued guidance left out some elements required by the law, such as requirements for institutions to report launched investigations or for federal agencies to share harassment reports, and that the guidance arrived 20 months behind schedule. GAO found that every included research institution would require policy updates to comply with OSTP guidance, but as of July, OSTP had not hired staff to monitor compliance as required by law, suggesting it may miss the October deadline.

Nevitt described the negative environmental effects of these leaf blowers, which are powered by antiquated engine technology. He noted that a half-hour of yard work with a gas-powered leaf blower emits the same amount of air pollution as driving cross-country in a large pickup truck. Nevitt criticized gas-powered leaf blowers for their excessive loudness, which can result in permanent hearing loss.

The decision was disclosed on Wednesday in a post by White House budget director Russell Vought, who said: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes amid an ongoing standoff between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

Cancelled projects

According to the Department of Energy (DOE), 223 projects were cancelled following a review that concluded they did not sufficiently advance US energy needs or were not financially sustainable.

The department stated the grants came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other divisions.

One of the most significant cancellations involves $1.2bn allocated to California’s planned hydrogen hub. Governor Gavin Newsom’s office said the hub had attracted $10bn in private investment and warned that cutting the project could endanger over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future – creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” Newsom said.

Senator Alex Padilla of California called the cancellation “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

Environmental groups expressed concern over the cuts. Jackie Wong, senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defence Council, said: “This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand.”

The states affected include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

Previous blows to solar

The news comes over a month since the administration’s August announcement that eligibility rules for clean energy tax credits were being tightened, threatening the country’s upcoming renewable projects. Solar, in particular, was highlighted.

August also saw the cancellation of the $7bn Solar For All programme, which was set to provide easier access to solar power for over 900,000 low-income households.

These targeted blows to the solar – and wider renewable energy – sector are part of a policy shift heralded by the signing of Executive Order 14315, Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources, and the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The motivation behind this shift is to re-prioritise fossil fuels, according to the US Department of the Interior.",https://solarstoragextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cropped-YouTube-Logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:09:02.454739

Non-triad markets weather tariffs Light-vehicle sales in non-Triad markets have weathered the economic impact of US trade tariffs better than expected.","With so many hurdles to overcome, is there still hope for electric vehicle (EV) markets around the world? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, outlines what is expected to happen to sales with Autovista24 editor Tom Geggus.

EV Volumes expects global light vehicle sales, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCVs), to grow by 3.6% in 2025. This exceeds the expected 1.1% increase outlined in the previous update.

The reason for this improved outlook is resilient demand in China and the non-Triad region. This forecast factors in US automotive tariffs. However, these are likely to have a smaller impact, with carmakers taking a more cautious approach with their pricing strategies. Other factors taken into consideration include political instability, conflicts, energy prices, and inflation.

Global EV deliveries, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), are forecast to increase by 24.5% this year. This means 22.1 million units are expected to hit the roads. The new forecast is up from the 19.7% growth expected in the previous update.

The improved outlook comes despite some governments phasing out purchase incentives and tax breaks amid mounting national debt, particularly in Europe.

The global EV share of the light-vehicle market is projected to grow to 24% in 2025 and 26.7% in 2026. In the following years, this is predicted to rise to 42% in 2030, before hitting 64.1% in 2035, and 83% in 2040. However, budget pressures and policy shifts may threaten investment in incentives and charging infrastructure.

European EV barriers

Western and Central Europe’s light vehicle market is currently facing a barrage of barriers to growth. There is uncertainty about changing goods tariffs, conflict in Ukraine, and tensions in the Middle East concerning European light-vehicle sales.

On top of this, there are the ongoing risks of increasing inflation, oil prices, and energy costs. Furthermore, the September 2025 OECD Economic Outlook predicts that GDP in the Euro area will only grow 1.2% in 2025. This is slightly higher than the 1% growth in the previous forecast. However, this rate is projected to retreat to 1% in 2026, down from 1.2% predicted previously.

Due to weaker goods exports to the US and a struggling services sector, LCV demand was affected by trade frictions and tariffs. Passenger vehicle sales quickly followed suit. Political uncertainty and rising debt levels are also curtailing light-vehicle demand.

More positively, the EU proposed tariff reductions in August 2025 to implement the EU-US trade agreement. This would see duties on the automotive sector reduced from 27.5% to 15%. The EU-Mercosur and EU-Mexico free-trade agreements have also strengthened the competitiveness of the region’s automotive industry. The UK has also negotiated a more favourable 10% tariff rate with the US.

A lower EV outlook

Reflecting the barriers the region faces, EV Volumes has lowered its European light-vehicle sales outlook for 2025. Volumes are now expected to decline by 1.1% year-on-year by the end of 2025. This is lower than in the previous forecast, which projected a 0.3% decline.

The 14.8 million units now expected this year are far below the 18 million registered in 2019. EV Volumes does not expect the European market to return to that level within the current forecast horizon, up to 2040. A 1.9% growth in light-vehicle sales in 2026 hinges on a complex interplay of regulatory and economic factors.

Stricter EU CO2 emissions targets are driving EV sales alongside lower prices, discounting, and the launch of new models. Additionally, the EU Commission plans to adopt a binding regulation in 2026 on vehicle recycling. This will require manufacturers to use more recyclable or reusable materials in new cars and vans.

Meeting the lower emissions targets and circularity requirements will necessitate a major increase in EV sales. In turn, this could even trigger a price war, supported by lower lithium costs. Manufacturers may also restrict the supply of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to avoid costly emissions fines.

Schemes and incentives

On a positive note, Italy announced €597 million in funding for a scrappage scheme. Meanwhile, Germany is considering the reintroduction of BEV incentives, although this is uncertain due to the coalition government and prevailing economic conditions.

In July 2025, the Electric Car Grant was launched in the UK. EV subsidies were increased for low-income households in France. Social leasing and a conditional extra financial incentive for electric models were launched at the end of September. Spain has also reactivated subsidies under the MOVES III scheme.

Meanwhile, more affordable BEVs are entering the market, and leading Chinese carmakers are planning further moves in the region.

PHEV registrations have exceeded expectations so far this year. This has been driven by eased CO2 targets, expanded Chinese PHEV offerings, and delayed launches of low-cost BEVs. Additionally, the UK’s ZEV mandate relaxation means hybrids can be sold until 2035, exempting them from the 2030 new-car ICE ban.

As a result, EV sales in Europe are expected to grow 26.7% year-on-year in 2025 to 3.88 million units. This accounts for 26.2% of total light-vehicle sales, up from 20.5% in 2024 and 21.3% in 2023. BEV volumes are forecast to grow 23.8% year-on-year, accounting for 67.1% of the 2025 BEV and PHEV mix. Meanwhile, PHEV sales are expected to increase by 32.8%.

So, what do new model launches, lower prices, and stricter emissions targets mean in the following years? EVs are forecast to reach a 30.6% share of European light-vehicle sales in 2026 and 36.5% in 2027.

The forecast for 2035 and beyond includes some tolerance for timing interpretations of the new-car ICE sales ban. It also allows for exemptions for vehicles that may be deemed unsuitable for full electrification.

Chinese resilience

Automotive demand and economic resilience have remained firm in China. The OECD recently upgraded the country’s 2025 GDP growth outlook to 4.9%. Meanwhile, EV Volumes has upgraded its light-vehicle market forecast for China. A total of 27.7 million sales are now expected by the end of 2025, equating to year-on-year growth of 6.7%.

This year has seen China’s scrappage programme extended beyond the original January 2025 deadline. However, it has now been suspended in several cities. This could disproportionately reduce demand for EVs given their higher bonus levels.

However, the country has recently announced a plan to stabilise growth in the automotive industry. Accordingly, China is targeting sales of approximately 15.5 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) this year. Alongside this, it is aiming for a 48% NEV penetration rate.

The country also pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions at the latest UN General Assembly. By 2035, China will look to reduce its emissions by up to 10% from their peak levels. This marks the nation’s first commitment to absolute emissions cuts.

Chinese OEMs continue to launch new PHEVs and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs). Meanwhile, BEVs are regaining momentum, bolstered by aggressive discounting initiated by BYD.

As such, BEVs are forecast to account for 60.1% of EV sales in 2025 and about two thirds by 2031. EVs are forecast to represent 51.6% of light-vehicle sales in 2025, rising to 73% in 2030, then 88.3% in 2035, and 95.7% in 2040.

Forecast volumes are based on retail sales, not wholesale. This excludes exports and inventory build-up, which explains differences from the typically higher wholesale-based figures published by other agencies.

Tariffs, bills and incentives

On 26 March, the US government announced 25% vehicle import duties. However, a two-year ‘import adjustment offset’ program has been implemented for manufacturers producing vehicles in the US.

According to J.D. Power, average new car prices in the US are expected to increase by 5% by the end of 2025. This could lead to an 8% drop in sales. However, many manufacturers did initially absorb the extra costs.

The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ act was signed into law in July 2025, ending EV tax credits on 30 September. Any resulting pull-forward effect so far in 2025 is expected to be offset by weaker demand in the final quarter.

Funding for Canada’s iZEV programme ran out in January 2025, with BEV uptake falling and no replacement scheme announced. In response to economic and trade pressures, the Canadian federal government also paused the 2026 Electric Vehicle Availability Standard. This mandated that 20% of new light-duty vehicle sales be zero-emission. The government initiated a 60-day review to assess and potentially adjust future targets.

EV Volumes has updated the 2025 light-vehicle sales forecast for Northern America, covering the US and Canada. The region is now expected to record just over 18 million sales, up 1.2% year-on-year. However, the year-on-year growth outlook was adjusted downward for 2026 to 2029.

The EV share is now expected to reach 10.1% in 2025 and rise only modestly to 10.2% in 2026. This is primarily supported by a more affordable Tesla model. EV shares are forecast to climb to 21.4% in 2030, before achieving 39.8% in 2035, and 59.1% in 2040. This is well below the predicted global EV share of over 80% in 2040.

Non-triad markets weather tariffs

Light-vehicle sales in non-Triad markets have weathered the economic impact of US trade tariffs better than expected. Accordingly, EV Volumes increased its 2025 sales growth forecast to 4.8%.

Japan increased the budget for EV subsidies under the Clean Vehicle Energy Subsidy Programme in early 2025. Meanwhile, India cut import duties for premium EVs as part of a new manufacturing programme in June 2025.

Indonesia introduced VAT exemption for low-emission vehicles in January 2025 and a reduced VAT rate. Finally, in response to US tariffs, South Korea launched temporary stimulus measures. This included financing support and higher EV subsidies.

Budget constraints driven by economic concerns may limit future incentive schemes. Several countries have also implemented, or plan to introduce, new tariffs on imported vehicles. This includes a 50% tariff in Mexico and up to 30% duties in Turkey. Indonesia is also looking to end incentives for imported, completely built-up BEVs, starting in 2026.

Against this backdrop, the EV share in non-Triad countries is forecast to reach 6.7% in 2025. This equates to around 2.1 million units. This percentage is projected to reach 16.9% in 2030, then 41.8% in 2035, and 76.8% in 2040. The region generally lags the global adoption curve by about five years.",https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/EV-Charging-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:01:43.782875

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced Wednesday that it has terminated 321 financial awards worth more than $7.5 billion for 223 projects across 16 states, all of which voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 elections.

""Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,"" the department said in a statement.

The move comes during an impasse in federal government shutdown negotiations in the Republican-led Congress, with Democrats holding out for an extension to Biden-era healthcare tax credits that will push down the cost of health insurance.

U.S. Sen. Tina Smith claims that the Trump administration is ""bullying Minnesotans"" amid the standoff between Democrats and Republicans in Congress over health care funding.

President Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to target Democratic priorities.

""We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,"" the president told reporters in the Oval Office. ""Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.""

As well as voting for Harris last November, all 16 states impacted by the cuts are also represented by two Democrats in the U.S. Senate, though two of then – New Hampshire and Vermont – have Republican governors.

Those states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

California's U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla called the cancelation of $1.2 billion for the state's hydrogen hub ""vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.""

The Environmental Defense Fund called out Vought for his ""unlawful attempt to cancel clean energy projects in states that didn’t vote for President Trump,"" which it argues will increase electricity costs for everyone.

""In the middle of a government shutdown, these are shamelessly partisan actions, pulled straight from the Project 2025 playbook, favoring insiders in the fossil fuel industry and punishing American families,"" the environmental organization wrote in a statement Thursday.

Trump shared on social media Thursday that he's meeting with Vought, whom the president identified as ""of PROJECT 2025 Fame"" to talk about ""which of the many Democrat Agencies"" could be cut, either temporarily or permanently.

“I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,” Trump posted to Truth Social. “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity. They are not stupid people, so maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

During his 2024 campaign, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint drafted by the Heritage Foundation. He called it a ""seriously extreme"" plan conceived by people on the ""severe right"" at a rally.",https://bringmethenews.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE4MTcyMDEzOTU5NzE4NzQ4/power-line.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 08:59:08.447533

As with much of the real estate industry, property technology, generally defined as the use of tech and software to make real estate and property management more efficient, took a big hit in recent years.

Higher interest rates, a capital market retraction and a push by almost all venture capital into artificial intelligence collectively hit property tech hard. While there is, of course, some AI in property tech, it hasn't been enough to really drive interest in a sector that has historically been extremely slow to modernize.

""I'd say we just lived through probably the most challenging three years that certainly I've ever experienced,"" said Brendan Wallace, co-founder and CEO of Fifth Wall. ""You saw a lot of companies and new businesses and venture funds die. We just lived through an extinction event.""

Fifth Wall is a venture capital fund managing over $3 billion in capital, the largest investment firm focused on technology for the built environment.

Wallace said the winter is over for property tech, citing last year's IPO of ServiceTitan , a cloud-based field service management software for trades such as HVAC, plumbing, electrical and landscaping. The company raised about $625 million in its initial public offering, and shares jumped 42% in their Nasdaq debut.

Wallace also noted new unicorns, such as Juniper Square and Bilt, which bode well for the future of property tech investing. Bilt, a platform offering loyalty rewards for housing, raised $250 million in July at a $10.75 billion valuation in a funding round led by General Catalyst and GID, including a strategic investment from United Wholesale Mortgage.

""The amount of enterprise value destruction that happened to prop tech was unprecedented from 2022 to 2024, but the amount of enterprise value creation that has just happened in the last 15 months has also been unprecedented,"" Wallace said.

That is not the case, however, in climate-related property tech. That space is becoming increasingly challenged due to the political winds in the U.S. that have shifted dramatically away from sustainability and climate resilience, not to mention climate science overall. As a result, the entire climate tech ecosystem in real estate is suffering.

Again, real estate has always been slow to modernize and was particularly slow to decarbonize. It got a huge boost, however, from President Joe Biden's administration and billions of dollars in public funding, much of which went to decarbonizing real estate overall. Then, Wallace said, the world shifted under its feet.

""Many climate funds are struggling to raise. Many real estate owners are deprioritizing sustainability, decarbonization and ESG [environmental, social and governance], and there is a palpable, negative sentiment shift that has set on climate-related prop tech,"" Wallace explained. ""And so what that means is we're still supporting our companies. We're actually still seeing lots of good progress, but the sentiment is negative.""

Despite the shift, he said he is optimistic about the sector for one powerful reason: While national policy may be anti-climate, local governments are not. Cities are running out of money, and carbon taxes are a very attractive way of raising capital. New York City is a prime example. It is not only moving much further left in its politics, but it has consistently been more environmentally progressive.

Fifth Wall, one of the biggest investors in this space, is taking the long-term play, investing while the negative ""halo"" around climate persists because valuations are attractive.

""My view is the real estate industry is still responsible for 40% of carbon emissions. It's still this industry that has shirked its responsibility for years, and it's going to cost a lot to decarbonize. It's a lot of money, and capital is going to flow into that space ... which is one of the reasons why we're still deploying capital, because we're the only ones,"" Wallace said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108205276-1759172450928-BFW.JPG?v=1759172592&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-03 11:00:04.843531

Utilities and electrical equipment firms are reporting record order backlogs, supported by incremental growth in the pipeline of data center plans.
Rising tariffs and resource protection are boosting the value of companies in the power and resources supply chain.
This trend is supporting higher valuations and stronger fundamentals for companies involved in the electrification value chain, in our view.
We recommend focusing on quality companies with strong infrastructure pipelines, proven execution, and the flexibility to adjust operations as market conditions evolve.","The latest round of AI capital spending is underpinning demand for electricity generation. US utility operator PG&E this week is the latest power sector company to announce major grid upgrades and transmission projects, pledging USD 73bn in new spending by 2030 to meet the needs of data centers and AI-driven demand. On Monday, Vistra Corp. announced a 20-year contract to sell 1,200 megawatts of power from its Comanche Peak nuclear plant in Texas to a large unnamed customer (likely a data center). Nationwide, power consumption is forecast to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, according to the US Energy Information Administration, as data center developers face mounting grid constraints.

In response, the US energy secretary said the government would intervene via emergency powers to delay the retirement of most coal-fired power plants and to accelerate the reopening of nuclear plants. These moves are part of a broader strategy to boost energy output, including regulatory reforms to speed up nuclear permitting and efforts to expand backup generation. The resulting increase in power sector spending is in line with our forecasts for USD 3tr in annual investment across power generation, energy storage, grid infrastructure, and data centers by 2030, backed by strong commercial customer demand to secure capacity for new projects.

Despite these investments and policy shifts, we believe many investors are underestimating both the scale and the durability of the electrification opportunity:

Strong order books and backlogs signal sustained demand. Utilities and electrical equipment firms are reporting record order backlogs, supported by incremental growth in the pipeline of data center plans. Channel checks suggest commercial customers are eager to secure power and equipment for their projects as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, utility companies' guidance suggests a healthy pipeline of power contracts—either already signed, in advanced discussion, or expected to materialize soon.

Critical minerals and resource nationalism add to tailwinds. Rising tariffs and resource protection are boosting the value of companies in the power and resources supply chain. We have observed a renewed focus on the importance of critical minerals, illustrated by rising resource nationalism and the implementation of protective trade measures. This trend is supporting higher valuations and stronger fundamentals for companies involved in the electrification value chain, in our view.

Valuation premiums look justified by superior earnings per share (EPS) growth. Our favored electrification stocks offer significantly higher potential EPS growth—10 percentage points in 2025 and 7 percentage points in 2026—over global equities (MSCI ACWI Index), according to Factset consensus. Despite their modestly higher valuations compared to the wider market, we think these companies offer robust risk-adjusted return prospects.

So we retain our high conviction for durable organic growth across the power and resources sector on the back of AI-driven demand, continued electrification, and solid policy support. We recommend focusing on quality companies with strong infrastructure pipelines, proven execution, and the flexibility to adjust operations as market conditions evolve. While the opportunity is substantial, investors should remain mindful of regulatory and execution risks, particularly around legacy asset upgrades and permitting, though we see these as manageable within a diversified approach.",https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealthmanagement/insights/chief-investment-office/house-view/daily/2025/latest-03102025/_jcr_content/root/pagehead/opengraphimage.227420959.img/outlook-lavin-village-four.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:09:29.249636

The urgent need for legal framework for storage was also highlighted at a breakfast held at the Federal Senate in Brasília on Wednesday.
That The Urgency of the Legal Framework for Storage event was organized by the Brazilian Association of Energy Storage Solutions (ABSAE), ABSolar and the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (Abeeólica) and was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).
Attendees at the breakfast released a draft text proposing a storage framework which could be included in Provisional Measure (MP) 1,304, which sets a limit of electricity bill subsidies and could address electricity sector reform.
Brazil cannot wait until 2028 to finalize regulation or implement projects at scale.","Brazil faces an energy paradox. On the one hand, it boasts one of the cleanest energy mixes in the world, with 85% of its electricity coming from renewable energy sources anchored by solar and wind power. Much of that clean energy, however, is “curtailed” – wasted – with gigawatt-hours lost daily as expensive, polluting thermal plants continue to operate.

The curtailment problem means energy storage could be an essential solution but the technology still lacks the consolidated regulation that would enable its full adoption.

At a Legal Framework and Sub-Legal Regulation for Energy Storage event held by the Brazilian Association of Photovoltaic Solar Energy (ABSolar) in São Paulo on Tuesday, representatives from the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), the legal sector, and energy and technology companies focused on a single message: Brazil needs to expedite the creation of a regulatory framework for storage and must adopt emergency measures to transform renewable energy abundance into energy security.

The urgent need for legal framework for storage was also highlighted at a breakfast held at the Federal Senate in Brasília on Wednesday. That The Urgency of the Legal Framework for Storage event was organized by the Brazilian Association of Energy Storage Solutions (ABSAE), ABSolar and the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (Abeeólica) and was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).

Attendees at the breakfast released a draft text proposing a storage framework which could be included in Provisional Measure (MP) 1,304, which sets a limit of electricity bill subsidies and could address electricity sector reform. The document considers batteries connected to generation sites, to the transmission grid, and small-scale, “distributed generation” (DG) batteries connected directly to energy users.

Regulation

At the ABSolar event, ANEEL Secretary General Daniel Cardoso Danna highlighted the progress of a regulatory process begun in 2020 with a Subsidy Collection, and which advanced to Public Consultation No. 39, of 2023, receiving 652 contributions from society and the private sector.

Danna said the agency has made progress on crucial decisions such as classifying storage operators as independent power producers – with a 35-year concession – and establishing the possibility of autonomous systems or sites co-located with power plants. Crucial issues such as pricing and applicable charges remain under debate, however.

“ANEEL’s mission is to provide favorable conditions for market development, balancing the interests of stakeholders and ensuring benefits for society,” said Danna. “We are 95% to 99% complete in this process and hope to soon consolidate a robust regulatory framework capable of providing legal certainty and predictability to the sector.” He added, the regulatory process will be completed in 2028, after two stages to address reversible plants, network cost sharing, and improvements to power cut prevention.

Curtailment: a ‘national tragedy‘

While ANEEL provided the institutional perspective, Grupo Energia CEO Rubens Brandt emphasized the need to address clean energy curtailment.

Presenting data from August, Brandt said wastage averaged 5.8 GWh, the equivalent of switching off the entire load of the state of Paraná and around 7% of national electricity consumption. “It’s an alarming situation,” said the CEO. “In August, we wasted the equivalent of the guaranteed generation of Belo Monte and Itaipu combined. We cannot treat cutting renewable energy while keeping thermal plants operating as normal. This is a national tragedy.”

The executive also pointed out blackouts are most frequent during mornings, and especially weekend and national holiday mornings: precisely when solar radiation is at its highest. Curtailment of clean power while thermal power generation continues illustrates lack of flexibility in system planning, according to Brandt.

“We’ve been discussing storage for five years while other countries have been moving forward for more than 15 years,” said the chief executive. “We can’t wait until 2029 to act. Batteries are our energy time machine: they allow us to store surplus energy in the morning and release it in the afternoon, replacing expensive and polluting thermal plants.”

Regulatory certainty

Henrique Reis, a partner at Demarest, said investors will not fully commit to storage without a clear legal framework for the technology. He said the definition of frameworks, rights, and duties is as important, if not more so, than the technology itself.

“The private sector is already seeing opportunities but, without legal certainty, there won’t be scale,” said Reis. “Brazil needs a robust and stable legal framework that provides clear conditions for investors, avoiding regulatory uncertainty and contractual bottlenecks.”

The Demarest partner said the success of Brazil’s solar and wind power sectors was only possible because a stable regulatory environment encouraged investment.v The same needs to happen for storage, Reis added.

Digital solutions

Closing the ABSolar event, Volt Robotics CEO Donato Filho said storage, far from offering just “arbitrage” opportunities to capitalize on energy price fluctuation could instead be a multi-functional solution offering services to the electricity system and consumers.

“Limiting batteries to arbitration alone would be like using a modern smartphone only to make calls,” said Filho. “Like cell phones, they have multiple applications: backup; ancillary services; consumption optimization; and, of course, curtailment reduction. It’s a versatile and strategic technology.”

Filho presented a model developed by his company – based on artificial intelligence inspired by genetic algorithms – illustrating the optimal battery size for electricity consumers and generators. Volt expects economic viability will arrive by next year, given the expected continued fall in battery prices.

“We’re applying artificial intelligence to identify lowest-cost, highest-benefit scenarios,” said the CEO. “The results already show that the systems pay for themselves in just a few years, especially when we consider all the services they can offer. It’s a solution for today, not a decade from now.”

Act now

It was unanimously agreed time is the greatest enemy. Brazil cannot wait until 2028 to finalize regulation or implement projects at scale. That would risk losing competitiveness, wasting ever-increasing amounts of renewable energy, and compromising the country’s strategic role in the global energy transition.

Energy storage, as the industry insiders emphasized, is not just a technological trend, it represents a structural condition for the future of the electricity sector that is capable of reducing costs, ensuring safety, integrating intermittently-generating electricity sources, and accelerating decarbonization. The message was clear: Brazil must transform urgency into action.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Brazil.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:09:38.898184

On social media, he called the funds that were targeted to be cut “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda,” suggesting the choices in funding cuts were highly political.
In her statement, Duckworth said she thought “there is no legal justification whatsoever” for the funding cuts.
Energy Department officials did not respond to a request for additional details.
Some other recipients of smaller terminated awards in Illinois included Cook County, the American Lung Association and Northwestern University.","Amid a funding stalemate in Congress and a federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump’s planned termination of nearly $8 billion for energy projects primarily in states that didn’t vote for him includes $583 million in cuts for projects in Illinois.

Among those set to lose tens of millions of dollars in anticipated funding are power giant Exelon, the University of Illinois, the nonprofit Gas Technology Institute, which is based in Des Plaines, and a handful of other entities in Illinois, according to congressional Democrats who released the full list when Trump’s Energy Department and Office of Management and Budget did not.

The director of the OMB, Russell Vought, made the announcement shortly after Congress forced the federal government into a shutdown. On social media, he called the funds that were targeted to be cut “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda,” suggesting the choices in funding cuts were highly political.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement that the cuts aim to eliminate 33 awards in Illinois, totaling more than $673 million, but that $90 million of that amount had already been spent. That translates to a loss of approximately $583 million.

The money was slated for transportation electrification, solar energy, “green” buildings and a range of other energy initiatives, according to a document released by Duckworth’s office.

In her statement, Duckworth said she thought “there is no legal justification whatsoever” for the funding cuts.

“Unsurprisingly for anyone familiar with how Trump operates, the more than 300 projects cancelled are overwhelmingly in states that did not vote for him in the 2024 election,” Duckworth said. “This abrupt cancellation not only jeopardizes local and regional economic growth but also sends a concerning message to researchers, entrepreneurs, unions and communities nationwide who rely on the federal government to act in good faith and in the national interest.”

The U.S. Department of Energy said on X that it chopped the hundreds of obligated awards nationwide “following a thorough, individualized financial review.”

These “projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the department said.

Recipients can appeal the decision, the department said. Energy Department officials did not respond to a request for additional details.

Since Trump entered office in January, his administration has targeted spending on environmentally friendly projects and called such efforts a “scam.” He called climate change a “con job” during a recent speech at the United Nations. At several points he has also clawed back money, attempted mass firings and ended programs in a push to cut costs, breaking norms and angering Democrats and organizations that rely on consistent federal funding.

Before Congress failed to approve a funding plan to keep the federal government operating, Trump threatened that he’d use the shutdown to punish political enemies, which would include Illinois, a state that has resoundingly rejected his three bids for the presidency.

The hardest hit in Illinois this week appeared to be the nonprofit GTI, which was set to have more than $400 million in awards terminated, according to the list from Duckworth. Those awards were intended for carbon capture technology projects and the study of methane emissions, among other initiatives, the document said.

The awards also included more than $30 million for carbon capture and other projects at the University of Illinois, as well as $100 million for Exelon and $50 million for its subsidiary, Commonwealth Edison, for electric grid modernization in Illinois, according to Duckworth’s list.

Some other recipients of smaller terminated awards in Illinois included Cook County, the American Lung Association and Northwestern University. One project for hydrogen use in heavy machinery by construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar was slated to occur in Chillicothe, in Peoria County, which is part of Republican U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood’s district, while the rest are affiliated with Democratic districts, according to a list from House Appropriations Committee Democrats.

One top-ranking Illinois Senate member, who is active on energy-related issues at the state Capitol, said what the Trump administration is doing “is a mistake.”

“If you’re an advocate of domestic energy production, which the administration claims to be, this would be the last thing you would be doing,” said Democratic state Sen. Bill Cunningham of Chicago. “This is cutting off domestic energy production.”

By integrating certified low-carbon feedstocks into our production of caprolactam/ammonium sulphate and downstream into PA6, we are showing our commitment to low-carbon materials and helping our customers meet their environmental goals,” added Thorsten Bredemann, VP Global Marketing & Sales Intermediates.

The start-up of CF Industries’ carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage project at its Donaldsonville Complex in July 2025, which has the capacity to sequester up to 2 million tpy of CO2 generated by the ammonia manufacturing process, enabled the production of low-carbon ammonia at the site. CF Industries expects to produce approximately 1.9 million t of VACI-certified low-carbon ammonia on an annual basis, which can also be upgraded into low-carbon nitrogen fertilizer products.

VACI is a voluntary programme developed by The Fertilizer Institute that certifies the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from ammonia production at a specific facility from natural gas well to production gate. The programme utilises a published methodology developed by industry experts to calculate the carbon intensity of the facility's ammonia production. The data collection and calculations are audited by a third-party verifier.

,Indiana Environment,2025-10-03 12:07:59+00:00,Indiana Capital Chronicle,Is Indiana's business climate losing traction?,"Niki Kelly, James E. Willis III, Amanda Jayne Miller, Tami Silverman",,,,,https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/10/03/state-losing-traction-on-business-climate-economic-development/,"Indiana’s business climate has been an advantage for a decade or more — consistently landing the state enviably high in various economic development metrics.
They don’t trust the state of Indiana,” he told a panel of lobbyists and public relations experts last month.
In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth.
The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.
“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor.","Indiana’s business climate has been an advantage for a decade or more — consistently landing the state enviably high in various economic development metrics. But that tide might be turning, and some mayors are concerned about the change.

Gov. Mike Braun brings a different style — and fewer handouts to corporations. He repeatedly attacked the state’s previous goals for focusing only on large companies while failing smaller businesses while on the campaign trail.

Crawfordsville Mayor Todd Barton said that sudden shift is causing companies to back away from the Hoosier state.

“They don’t trust us. They don’t trust the state of Indiana,” he told a panel of lobbyists and public relations experts last month. “There’s a loss of sense of direction. And I’m not going to say I totally was always on board with the direction before, but we had a direction, right? And sometimes it was a little confusing, but at least we had a sense of direction.”

Barton said on recent trips with site selectors he has seen a decided shift against bringing investment and job growth to Indiana.

“For years, we’d go to those meetings and they were like, ‘Oh, you’re from Indiana. You guys are rock stars…we’ll put projects in Indiana every single day.’

“This year, I’ve been on three different trips, and every single trip, all we heard was, ‘Eh, we don’t know.’ We do not have — to the outside world — a clear economic development policy in the state of Indiana right now. Period. “

And it’s not just anecdotal.

In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth. The state especially excelled in the key categories of overall cost, access to qualified labor, business incentive programs, logistics and infrastructure.

Compare that same ranking for 2025. Indiana dropped to 12th for top states to do business.

And here is how Indiana fared in key categories:

Overall cost – 1st to 5th

Access to qualified labor – 4th to 6th

Availability of sites – 4th to not ranked

Business incentive programs – 3rd to not ranked

Logistics and infrastructure – 3rd to 7th

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation has had some organizational changes in the last nine months. Its executive director left in September after being hired in January. Braun replaced the entire board in June, and the quasi-governmental agency has been part of a forensic spending audit.

Lawmakers also mandated the hiring of a second leader, and that still hasn’t happened five months later.

“Gov. Braun’s economic development strategy is to grow jobs and increase wages. He is prioritizing regional input and leadership from around the state, which is a shift away from the central Indiana-focused approach of recent years,” said Commerce Secretary David Adams. “This strategy is already working, as the most recent numbers show, with incentivized jobs paying on average $8,000 more per year and costing only a third of what they did a year ago.”

Braun has urged his administration to focus less on large employers in central Indiana, instead looking at growth opportunities for communities around the state. A large swath of counties also have resisted energy-related developments such as wind, solar and data centers, which could be impacting rankings.

Last week, the governor highlighted that year-over-year, the average wage of jobs incentivized by the IEDC to come to Indiana has increased from $37 to $41, a 10% increase. The average cost per incentivized job decreased from $55,000 per job to $16,000 per job.

That’s partly because the state no longer has federal money to spend for incentives. Under former Gov. Eric Holcomb there was hundreds of millions to give out. But the budget for the IEDC has dropped 60% — meaning less money to spread around.

The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.

From an outside perspective, I can say that the IEDC was a free-wheeling, secretive entity that had entirely too much leash. And I appreciate that Braun is taking initiative and getting it under control.

Noblesville Mayor Chris Jensen said on the same panel with Barton that there are two things business leaders ask about most: health care and utility costs — both things lawmakers have wrestled to get under control.

Braun has recently targeted high energy costs in the state, appointing a new official to represent ratepayers and urging state regulators to think less about utility shareholders and more about Hoosiers paying the bill. His administration pushed certain health priorities over the finish line during the legislative session, but some had to be scaled back to get votes.

But Jensen also acknowledged that part of the problem is a changing of the guard since Braun took over in January.

“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor. And I think what we need to do right now is get out of our own way and go tell our story — and boldly tell our story. Not just in Indiana, but around the country and around the world. And have a clear message and a clear messenger,” Jensen said.

“I think it starts at the very top. We have to be visionary, we have to be bold, we have to be excited. We have to be transformational, and we have to get out of our own way.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Indiana_A-State-that-Works.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 13:04:08.283758

Swapping out gray hydrogen for clean hydrogen could slash their carbon footprints—and having compact plants close to these users cuts transport emissions, too.
The hope now is that clean hydrogen will revitalize its industrial base and keep more value in-state.","When Andrew Cottone kicked off First State Hydrogen in 2023, nobody could’ve seen the whirlwind ahead. Fast forward a few months and with Dora Cheatham coming onboard as VP of Sales and Commercialization in early 2024, the Wilmington team rebranded as Aternium. Then on September 25, 2025, they scored a big win: a $1 million investment from the State of Delaware via the Delaware Accelerator & Seed Capital Program (DASCP). Fueled by a federal SSBCI grant for early-stage clean energy ventures, they’ve got serious momentum—and the timing couldn’t be better.

Aternium isn’t going it alone. They’ve teamed up with German powerhouse Siemens for top-of-the-line electrolyzers, and Honeywell is on deck to keep everything humming with AI-driven predictive maintenance and rock-solid cybersecurity. They’re even capturing byproducts—think purified oxygen and heavy water—so every drop of feedstock pulls double duty.

“This funding is a total game-changer,” Cheatham says. “It validates our strategy and lets us fast-track compact, low-emission hydrogen production right here in the First State.”

This state backing dovetails perfectly with federal pushes—like the DOE’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act incentives and the national spotlight on hydrogen hubs. And as an anchor partner in the MACH2 Clean Hydrogen Hub, Aternium is plugged into a regional effort spanning Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland to build out clean hydrogen infrastructure.

Powering Up with Electrolysis and AI

So, what’s the secret sauce? Aternium is banking on Siemens DRL 9 electrolyzers. Unlike high-pressure systems, these modular units run at ambient pressure—no expensive compression gear and up to 15% less energy loss. Each skid can crank out tons of hydrogen daily—enough to fuel local chemical plants, data centers, or refueling stations. Since the electricity comes from nearby solar and wind projects, the result is truly clean hydrogen.

Better still, these DRL 9 units can throttle production up or down on the fly to match intermittent renewables. When solar or wind output shifts, the system adjusts in real time, boosting efficiency and helping to balance the grid during peak demand.

To keep surprises at bay, Aternium tapped Honeywell for an AI-driven predictive maintenance solution. Ultrasonic sensors and temperature probes stream data into a cloud analytics engine—safeguarded by enterprise-grade cybersecurity—so they can spot issues before they snowball, cut down maintenance costs, and extend equipment life.

Can Delaware Flip from Energy Importer to Exporter?

First up, Aternium has its eye on Kent County. Aging chemical facilities and idle industrial plots make perfect brownfield sites. Their design philosophy boils down to three key points:

Footprint efficiency: Skid-mounted modules mean minimal civil work and rapid deployment.

No on-site storage: Hydrogen’s produced to order and shipped immediately, cutting safety risks.

Scalable growth: Plants can be replicated or expanded quickly as demand rises.

All of this is driven by industrial decarbonization. Local chemical and food-processing plants need hydrogen for refining and packaging. Swapping out gray hydrogen for clean hydrogen could slash their carbon footprints—and having compact plants close to these users cuts transport emissions, too.

On the mobility front, Delaware agencies are eyeing hydrogen fuel cell buses and heavy-duty trucks to replace aging diesel fleets. A local hydrogen production source could be a real game-changer, sidestepping long-haul trucking from distant suppliers.

Who’s knocking on Aternium’s door? Data centers looking for green backup power, the Port of Wilmington exploring cleaner refueling for its big rigs, and even pipeline hookups to send hydrogen onward to Philadelphia or New York. Could Delaware flip the script and become a Delaware energy exporter? That’s the dream—though it depends on market growth and significant infrastructure build-out.

Delaware’s Chemical Roots Spark New Energy Era

Delaware’s got deep chemical roots and technical know-how, but it’s long relied on imported fuel. The hope now is that clean hydrogen will revitalize its industrial base and keep more value in-state. Beyond existing plants, offering on-site hydrogen could lure data centers, green steel makers, and anyone else craving reliable, low-carbon energy. Plus, being smack in the East Coast corridor gives Delaware strategic access to major markets.

Academic institutions are jumping in, too. The University of Delaware’s College of Engineering is lining up research partnerships, while Delaware State University’s Center for Environmental Justice is working to ensure training and job opportunities in the new hydrogen economy are accessible to all. Community colleges are developing apprenticeships and certification programs with Aternium to get technicians and engineers ready for these cutting-edge facilities.

What’s Next on Aternium’s Roadmap?

That $1 million from DASCP will cover front-end engineering and design (FEED), permitting studies, and the first round of community outreach. At the same time, Aternium is in talks with utilities like Delmarva Power about tariff structures that reward flexibility and grid services. They’re also exploring hydrogen blends in existing natural gas pipelines to ease the transition for end users.

Meanwhile, the team’s lining up private investors for a Series A round, targeting federal clean hydrogen tax credits and grants under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. If permitting and market conditions line up, they could break ground by mid-2026 and deliver the first hydrogen before year’s end. Fingers crossed!

“We’re not just putting up another plant,” says Andrew Cottone. “We’re sketching out a blueprint for responsible, distributed hydrogen production. With partners like Siemens, Honeywell, MACH2, and our state champions, we’re carving a path toward a cleaner, more resilient energy system.”",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/resized-1759237769810.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 12:10:56.352042

Wainwright raised its price target on to $7.00 from $3.00 on Friday, while maintaining a Buy rating on the hydrogen fuel cell company. The stock has shown strong momentum, gaining over 130% in the past six months, though InvestingPro data indicates the stock is currently trading above its Fair Value.

The price target increase reflects rising electricity prices across the United States, with residential, commercial, and industrial electricity rates increasing by approximately 6.6%, 4.8%, and 5.1% respectively over the past year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. While Plug Power maintains a moderate debt level with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.59, InvestingPro analysis reveals the company faces profitability challenges with negative gross margins.

Some regions have experienced even steeper increases, with Maine seeing a 36.3% rise, Connecticut 18.4%, and Indiana 11.5% in electricity costs, driven by growing data center power demands and industrial electrification trends.

H.C. Wainwright noted that higher electricity prices could make green hydrogen increasingly price-competitive compared to traditional grey hydrogen, strengthening the case for adoption of Plug Power’s technology.

The firm also cited positive sentiment toward nuclear power, particularly small modular reactors, as potentially benefiting hydrogen adoption, with federal targets aiming for 35GW of new nuclear capacity by 2035 and approximately 200GW of additional capacity by 2050.

In other recent news, Plug Power Inc. announced the delivery of its first 10-megawatt GenEco™ electrolyzer array to Galp in Portugal, marking a significant step in creating Europe’s largest proton exchange membrane hydrogen electrolyzer project. This project is expected to produce up to 15,000 tons of renewable hydrogen annually by early 2026. Additionally, Plug Power has amended its at-the-market sales agreement to include Yorkville Securities as an additional sales agent, allowing the company to offer up to $1 billion of its common stock. The terms of this agreement remain largely unchanged aside from the addition of Yorkville Securities.

In operational developments, Plug Power reported record production levels at its Georgia green hydrogen facility, with 324 metric tons of green hydrogen produced in August 2025. Oppenheimer noted operational improvements at the company’s Georgia facility, highlighting successful execution of key initiatives. Analyst firm Craig-Hallum raised its price target for Plug Power to $4.00, maintaining a Buy rating, citing a positive growth outlook. This update comes after meetings with Plug Power’s CFO and VP of Investor Relations. These recent developments reflect Plug Power’s ongoing efforts to expand its hydrogen production capabilities and market presence.

In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth.

The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.
“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor.","Indiana’s business climate has been an advantage for a decade or more — consistently landing the state enviably high in various economic development metrics. But that tide might be turning, and some mayors are concerned about the change.

Gov. Mike Braun brings a different style — and fewer handouts to corporations. He repeatedly attacked the state’s previous goals for focusing only on large companies while failing smaller businesses while on the campaign trail.

Crawfordsville Mayor Todd Barton said that sudden shift is causing companies to back away from the Hoosier state.

“They don’t trust us. They don’t trust the state of Indiana,” he told a panel of lobbyists and public relations experts last month. “There’s a loss of sense of direction. And I’m not going to say I totally was always on board with the direction before, but we had a direction, right? And sometimes it was a little confusing, but at least we had a sense of direction.”

Barton said on recent trips with site selectors he has seen a decided shift against bringing investment and job growth to Indiana.

“For years, we’d go to those meetings and they were like, ‘Oh, you’re from Indiana. You guys are rock stars…we’ll put projects in Indiana every single day.’

“This year, I’ve been on three different trips, and every single trip, all we heard was, ‘Eh, we don’t know.’ We do not have — to the outside world — a clear economic development policy in the state of Indiana right now. Period. “

And it’s not just anecdotal.

In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth. The state especially excelled in the key categories of overall cost, access to qualified labor, business incentive programs, logistics and infrastructure.

Compare that same ranking for 2025. Indiana dropped to 12th for top states to do business.

And here is how Indiana fared in key categories:

Overall cost – 1st to 5th

Access to qualified labor – 4th to 6th

Availability of sites – 4th to not ranked

Business incentive programs – 3rd to not ranked

Logistics and infrastructure – 3rd to 7th

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation has had some organizational changes in the last nine months. Its executive director left in September after being hired in January. Braun replaced the entire board in June, and the quasi-governmental agency has been part of a forensic spending audit.

Lawmakers also mandated the hiring of a second leader, and that still hasn’t happened five months later.

“Gov. Braun’s economic development strategy is to grow jobs and increase wages. He is prioritizing regional input and leadership from around the state, which is a shift away from the central Indiana-focused approach of recent years,” said Commerce Secretary David Adams. “This strategy is already working, as the most recent numbers show, with incentivized jobs paying on average $8,000 more per year and costing only a third of what they did a year ago.”

Braun has urged his administration to focus less on large employers in central Indiana, instead looking at growth opportunities for communities around the state. A large swath of counties also have resisted energy-related developments such as wind, solar and data centers, which could be impacting rankings.

Last week, the governor highlighted that year-over-year, the average wage of jobs incentivized by the IEDC to come to Indiana has increased from $37 to $41, a 10% increase. The average cost per incentivized job decreased from $55,000 per job to $16,000 per job.

That’s partly because the state no longer has federal money to spend for incentives. Under former Gov. Eric Holcomb there was hundreds of millions to give out. But the budget for the IEDC has dropped 60% — meaning less money to spread around.

The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.

From an outside perspective, I can say that the IEDC was a free-wheeling, secretive entity that had entirely too much leash. And I appreciate that Braun is taking initiative and getting it under control.

Noblesville Mayor Chris Jensen said on the same panel with Barton that there are two things business leaders ask about most: health care and utility costs — both things lawmakers have wrestled to get under control.

Braun has recently targeted high energy costs in the state, appointing a new official to represent ratepayers and urging state regulators to think less about utility shareholders and more about Hoosiers paying the bill. His administration pushed certain health priorities over the finish line during the legislative session, but some had to be scaled back to get votes.

But Jensen also acknowledged that part of the problem is a changing of the guard since Braun took over in January.

“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor. And I think what we need to do right now is get out of our own way and go tell our story — and boldly tell our story. Not just in Indiana, but around the country and around the world. And have a clear message and a clear messenger,” Jensen said.

“I think it starts at the very top. We have to be visionary, we have to be bold, we have to be excited. We have to be transformational, and we have to get out of our own way.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/indiana_a-state-that-works1759489498.jpg?h=6d99a5c6&itok=G0IvjDQX,N,,2025-10-03 12:12:26.210663

New Mexico was one of 21 predominantly blue states in the DOE’s rescission of funding for 223 energy projects across 21 states, equaling $7.56 billion in already appropriated funding.

U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM) told KOB on Thursday that the companies are still on the hook to pay its contractors though, and this could lead to higher utility rates pushed onto consumers.

“They are contractually obligated to the people that they are buying batteries from wires, from poles from, and so they’re going to have to pay those contracts,” said Leger Fernandez. “They can’t just say, ‘Sorry.’ The only place that they can raise revenue is by raising rates.”

One of the most significant project losses impact the Navajo Nation, where the Navajo Transitional Energy Company was set to receive $6.6 million for a carbon capture system at the Four Corners Power Plant. The $13.1 million project would have tested full-scale CO2 reduction technology but is now scrapped.

In northern New Mexico, Kit Carson Electric Cooperative lost $15.4 million in federal support for a battery energy storage system aimed at improving grid resiliency, part of a $29.3 million investment. New Mexico’s largest utility company PNM also saw its $72.6 million virtual power plant project cut after the administration pulled $35.6 million in funding.

The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology was hit particularly hard. Its projects under the Department of Energy’s Fossil Energy Carbon Management office included a $42.7 million carbon storage hub in the San Juan Basin, methane emission mitigation technology, and direct air capture research — all of which lost federal backing.

Clean energy innovators were also affected.

Solar Dynamics lost $3 million for a solar thermal project designed to convert biosolids into fertilizer. Meanwhile, Albuquerque-based Pajarito Powder, LLC, which develops hydrogen fuel and catalyst technologies, saw two projects scrapped: a $10 million grant for oxygen evolution catalysts to supply the electrolyzer industry, and another $8.5 million project to expand catalyst material manufacturing.

“Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states was nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful. And now those cancelled energy projects have become the latest casualty of Trump’s vengeful attack on the American people,” U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) wrote in a statement on Thursday.

Leger Fernandez echoed what Heinrich said.

“They have a signed agreement, a signed agreement,” she said. “Now, you would think that if you have a signed agreement with the United States, it would be worth its signature.”

Meanwhile, PNM sent a statement to KOB about the cuts:

“PNM is currently evaluating the energy project cuts that have occurred today,” wrote KOB Spokesperson Eric Chavez. “While these cuts could impact some technical enhancement projects, the company wants to ensure customers that the overall Grid Modernization Project that was approved by state regulators last year is still moving forward. PNM will continue to focus on providing safe and reliable power to the communities we serve.”",https://www.kob.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-administration-scraps-135M-in-New-Mexico-clean-energy-projects-potentially-raising-utility-costs.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 08:59:03.926180

The Energy Poverty Prevention Project can’t do it alone.","As the weather turns colder, millions of families are bracing for another season of high energy costs and, for many, the threat of going without heat. One truth is impossible to ignore: Energy is becoming a luxury.

In the last year, residential electricity prices have risen 6.5% nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Since 2022, estimates place the overall increase closer to 13%. Natural gas, heating oil and propane prices remain volatile, and households that struggled to keep cool this summer are now worried about how to stay warm this winter.

This is not a regional issue. From New England families dependent on fuel oil, to Midwestern households facing record utility bills, to seniors on fixed incomes in the South, the crisis of energy poverty has gone mainstream. Families are making impossible choices: between groceries and heating, or medicine and electricity.

As the leader of the Energy Poverty Prevention Project, I’ve spent nearly a decade calling out this quiet emergency. I’ve testified before Congress five times. I’ve met parents who ration electricity, seniors who wear coats indoors, and students who can’t keep their laptops charged for school. For them, energy is neither affordable nor reliable; it’s a luxury.

Who is at fault? Greedy utility executives? Commodity traders? For the answer, look no further than your nearest elected official.

For years, government policy has pushed a one-sided energy transition. Coal and natural gas plants that once provided steady, affordable baseload power have been retired in droves. In Maryland, more than 3,800 megawatts of coal-fired power generation have been taken offline since 2012. Meanwhile, subsidies flow toward electric vehicles and energy-hungry data centers, all of which compete with families for the same kilowatts.

Utility executives and commodity traders keep the lights on. Government, too often, turns them off.

That’s why I’m urging Congress and state leaders to act: Protect access to affordable, reliable energy by ending policies that raise costs and leave vulnerable communities behind.

If we put customers and providers, rather than bureaucrats, at the center of energy policy, the result will be lower bills, more growth opportunities, and greater financial freedom for families.

The Energy Poverty Prevention Project can’t do it alone. It’s time for policymakers to wake up. It’s time to measure energy policy by human costs, not carbon counts. No parent should choose between feeding a child and heating a home. No student should fall behind because they can’t keep the lights on. And no American, not one, should be forced into poverty to survive the winter.

Let’s act as if energy matters. Because for millions, it’s the difference between hardship and hope.",https://thedailyrecord.com/files/2025/10/Derrick-Hollie_Column.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 08:00:14.132689

U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 19 other Democrat-led jurisdictions in their August suit against the Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright, over attempts to cut funding for such projects.

Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal Energy Department. Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench — no written order had yet been filed with the court.

States argued that a new department rule limiting “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — to 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown welcomed Kasubhai’s ruling. Maryland was one of the states on the suit.

“This ruling stops an unlawful policy by President Trump’s Energy Department that would have undermined Maryland’s efforts to meet climate goals and deliver a cleaner, healthier environment for our children and grandchildren,” Brown said Thursday in a prepared statement.

Officials with the departments of Energy and Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.

The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.

Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.

“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”

Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.

Besides Maryland and Oregon, others signed on to the suit were the District of Columbia and the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.

Beyond making the bikes accessible, though, lies the challenge of making cities accessible for bikes.
None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes.
The gold standard, Bigazzi said, is protected infrastructure for bikes, in which a lane is physically separated from vehicles.
Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times.","This story was originally published by Grist and is republished here with permission. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

Last year, San Francisco voters did something exceedingly rare in car-crazy America: They closed two miles of a coastal highway to vehicles, creating a sprawling park for pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists. Of course, furious residents in the neighborhood bordering the erstwhile highway voted last month to recall their representative at City Hall for championing the transformation and, to their minds, creating a traffic nightmare on side streets—even though commute times in the area have grown by just a few minutes since the closure.

The battle in the City by the Bay is emblematic of the inflection point facing cities nationally. As more electric vehicles hit the road, the temptation is to invest heavily in the infrastructure—roads, highways, parking lots—that will preserve the status quo of prioritizing cars over people. Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing—and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars—providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option. The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?

Cities and states throughout the country are taking steps to make existing infrastructure more accommodating to those who prefer to pedal. They are lowering vehicle speed limits, building designated bike lanes, providing charging, and ensuring underserved neighborhoods don’t get left behind. All of this has been a big change in just the past few years, given that some locales didn’t regulate e-bikes at all until the late 2010s, said Leigh Ann Von Hagen, director of the Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. “All states have seen the writing on the wall,” she said.

The promise of the e-bike is that it can help people of every age. Parents are carting children around on beefy models with built-in bins. Workers can use them to get to and from their jobs. Shoppers can slap saddle bags over the rear fender to haul groceries. And elderly folks, who may not be confident in their ability to operate a conventional pedaller, can use them in lieu of driving. “I have an uncle in Tennessee who started riding an e-bike when he retired because he just didn’t want to drive to the store anymore,” Von Hagen said.

In addition to that lowering of carbon emissions—how much exactly will depend on the city and the rate of e-bike adoption, but the drop may be somewhere around 12 percent—there’s also the harder-to-quantify health benefits of people exercising more. Plus, fewer cars spewing pollution improves air quality and public health. EVs, too, release their own form of pollution: Because they’re heavier than combustion cars, their tires produce more microplastics—though their brakes produce much less dust—that sully the air and wash out to sea.

Drivers may experience range anxiety about their electric vehicle not having the juice to reach their destination, but the opposite is true for e-bikers. Older people or those with medical conditions might avoid conventional cycling because they worry about having the energy to make it somewhere, especially if there are hills in their way. With e-bike ranges far exceeding the average distance that riders are traveling (around 6 miles), range anxiety can be higher for those providing their own pedaling power. “When we do interviews with people, they will use the e-bike on eco, or even off, when they’re on flat terrain, and as soon as they get to that hill, they consistently report putting it up to the maximum,” said Jessica Bourne, an active travel researcher at the University of Bristol in the UK. “As one participant described it: It’s just flattening their journey.”

You can see the potential for e-bikes to replace cars in how their riders compare to those on conventional bikes. Given that e-bike users have the option to let the motor do all the work, you might assume that they’re burning fewer calories. But research has shown that riders tend to travel significantly farther on e-bikes, meaning they’re getting about as much physical activity as those taking shorter trips on conventional bikes.

Put another way: It’s less exertion, but more time spent exercising and running errands. “Once you account for increased frequency and increased duration and distance traveled, they spend longer on the bike overall, so they’re actually expending more energy on a weekly basis,” Bourne said. “That’s why they have more potential to substitute for motorized vehicles.”

Indeed, several studies have shown that people are already replacing car trips with e-bike rides on a wide scale. And the more bike-friendly cities make themselves, the more people opt for two wheels: Between 2009 and 2014, commuting by conventional bikes and electric versions doubled in New York City and Washington D.C thanks in part to better bicycle infrastructure. E-bike sales in North America doubled between 2018 and 2021. (So too have e-bike and e-scooter related injuries increased, due largely to insufficient and unsafe infrastructure for riders.)

Established cycling havens like the Netherlands—where the average person rides 680 miles a year, despite the chill of winter—show just how much the built environment can influence travel choices. “In the Netherlands, we say there’s no bad weather—there’s only bad clothing,” said Joost de Kruijf, a travel behavior researcher at Dutch Cycling Intelligence. “Once you reach a kind of threshold where you do all your trips by bicycle, then it just becomes a habit.”

The challenge, though, is that e-bikes remain expensive—anywhere from around $1,000 to over ten times that amount—putting them out of reach of the people who could benefit the most. Low-income folks without cars would get access to more employment opportunities if they had e-bikes, Bourne said, because they can travel farther, and often more conveniently. Similarly, young people would have greater access to education opportunities at colleges beyond walking distance or transit routes. That’s especially true if they’re living car-free somewhere with poor public transportation, a problem known to researchers as transport poverty.

The solution, Bourne said, is to subsidize e-bikes. California, for instance, has provided up to $2,000 for low-income residents to buy them, though the program is no longer accepting applications. Denver has offered similar support. “If it’s going to benefit the planet and it’s going to reduce the cars on the road, then why don’t we provide the subsidies for e-bikes, as we do for electric cars?” Bourne asks. “It just seems bananas to me.”

In fact, studies have shown that rebates incentivizing EV purchases and rebates that incentivize e-bikes can be equally effective, both costing about a dollar per ton of avoided carbon dioxide emissions, at least in British Columbia. “The big difference is electric bike incentives come with a whole range of other co-benefits,” said Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering and planning at the University of British Columbia. “Whereas electric car incentives actually have some downsides, because we know it incentivizes even more driving, which makes congestion worse, and leads to more sedentary lifestyles, and leads to higher infrastructure costs.” (Some research has shown what’s called a rebound effect: Because electric vehicles are cheaper to operate, there can be a modest increase in total vehicle miles traveled.)

Indeed, in a report published last week, Bigazzi found that an e-bike rebate program in British Columbia helped recipients increase their cycling by 25 miles per week and reduce their car use by almost 11 miles. That, in turn, reduced emissions from travel by 17 percent per year, and increased physical activity during travel by 13 percent. Denver has said its popular e-bike voucher program has helped eliminate 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.

Experts say cities could also start to think about bike share programs as an extension of their public transportation system. “It really is a public benefit to get people from point A to point B without needing to park or drive a car,” said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. “There is an argument that having some sort of public subsidy, like public transit does, could greatly increase the number of folks that are able to use those systems.”

Cities where those programs already exist have seen success. Citi Bike in New York, run by the rideshare company Lyft, can be a model. With over a million riders every year, the program, which provides e-bikes and conventional bikes, is an accessible part of the city’s infrastructure.

Beyond making the bikes accessible, though, lies the challenge of making cities accessible for bikes. “I think the infrastructure needs to be somehow retrofitted for these faster mobility devices,” said Greg Rybarczyk, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint, who studies e-mobility in the Detroit metro area. Making sure bikers know the rules of the road—and drivers know how to handle bikers—is critical, too. “I think there’s a long way to go in terms of driver education and marketing campaigns,” Rybarczyk said.

Even in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed. But respondents to an e-bike user survey Rybarczyk conducted say that Detroit’s bike lanes aren’t well-maintained, putting them in unsafe situations. “The street sweepers don’t sweep the bike lanes. They don’t sweep the curbs as much. There’s a lot of debris on a lot of the routes in and around Detroit.” Maintaining–and, potentially, widening–bike lanes could do a great deal for e-bike users outside of the coastal megacities. So, too, could providing accessible charging and storage facilities, according to Amelia Neptune, who coordinates the League of American Bicyclist’s infrastructure evaluation program, Bike Friendly America.

“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said. Some “bike pod” companies are offering a potential solution for those who don’t have garages at home to store their bikes. And some of the colleges and universities that work with Bike Friendly America are beginning to offer e-bike parking options in their dormitories.

None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes. The gold standard, Bigazzi said, is protected infrastructure for bikes, in which a lane is physically separated from vehicles. Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times.

Now cities face a choice: Invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists. “Cities can build out almost their whole bike network for the cost of rebuilding one or two freeway interchanges,” Bigazzi said. “So the cost of cycling infrastructure—even high-quality, protected infrastructure—is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”

Pankaj Sharma, president of the Association of Trade and Industries Undertakings (ATIU), said Punjab must declare renewable energy as a priority sector to stay competitive.
A new land policy for solar parks and open access to power could make Punjab more attractive for investment, he added.
The committee is also asking for a capital subsidy scheme, since building 1 MW of solar power costs between Rs 4 and 7 crore.
“If these reforms are implemented, Punjab can become a renewable energy leader in North India,” Sharma said.","The Punjab government’s Renewable Energy Sector Committee is preparing to present a detailed plan to speed up the state’s clean energy transition. The committee will soon meet industry minister Sanjeev Arora to share its recommendations.

Pankaj Sharma, president of the Association of Trade and Industries Undertakings (ATIU), said Punjab must declare renewable energy as a priority sector to stay competitive.

He explained that many industrialists are setting up solar projects in states like Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, where they sell power at Rs 3 per unit, but then have to buy it back in Punjab at Rs 9–10 per unit. A new land policy for solar parks and open access to power could make Punjab more attractive for investment, he added.

The committee is also asking for a capital subsidy scheme, since building 1 MW of solar power costs between Rs 4 and 7 crore. Punjab has an estimated potential of 5–6 GW, which would require Rs 20,000–35,000 crore in investment. Local solar manufacturing clusters have also been suggested to cut dependence on imports and create jobs.

Other proposals include raising rooftop solar limits for industries, easier transfer of security deposits when factories change hands, and building small hydro plants along Punjab’s canals to generate low-cost clean energy while creating rural jobs.

Currently, Punjab has just 1.2 GW of solar capacity, far behind states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka. Committee members stressed that with nearly 300 sunny days a year, Punjab can do much better. “If these reforms are implemented, Punjab can become a renewable energy leader in North India,” Sharma said.

Clean-energy advocates have assailed the company’s new “Carbon Plan” update, saying it commits the state to old-school polluting technologies or unproven designs that could cost rate-payers billions of dollars while better, cheaper options are available.

“North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy’s low energy rates continue to support this region’s economic success,” Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president, said in a statement accompanying the plan’s release this week. “By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.”

Public interest groups including NCWarn, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar and the Southern Environmental Law Center say the plan ultimately would result in higher bills for customers and make it harder for North Carolina to meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

“Today, Duke Energy published yet another plan that lets North Carolinians down,” said Jake Duncan, the southeast senior regulatory director for Vote Solar. “This is the third Carbon Plan that fails to meet the moment. Instead of investing enough in low-cost, fuel-free distributed clean energy resources like solar that strengthens communities and lowers bills, Duke is doubling down on massive new methane gas plants and delaying coal retirements. The result will be higher costs for families, more pollution in local communities, and a worsening climate crisis.”

The burning of fossil fuels such as gas, coal and oil generates carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration show that global warming is resulting in the loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer and more intense heat waves.

What is a Carbon Plan?

The Carbon Plan, also called the Resource Plan, is released every two years and updated each year in between to help North Carolina politicians, regulators and residents understand how Duke Energy — a regulated monopoly — plans to handle the state’s power demands.

The plan must be approved by the N.C. Utilities Commission, which tries to balance the need for enough power-generating capacity to attract and keep industry without putting rate-payers on the hook for building more power plants than needed or ones that don’t function properly.

The Carbon Plan is expected to be under especially close scrutiny by watchdog groups since North Carolina legislators approved Senate Bill 266 in July, overriding Gov. Josh Stein’s veto and allowing Duke Energy to charge customers in advance for power plants, before they’re built or brought online.

This method of financing, called Construction While in Progress, saves the utility, and by extension its customers, interest that would be charged on borrowed construction funds. But in other states it has resulted in rate-payers funding plants that were never completed or came in late and far over budget.

The bill also allows Duke Energy to miss a goal of a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, which the company had agreed to but now says is unattainable.

The utility still is supposed to reach carbon neutrality — meaning that for every ton of carbon dioxide its plants produce, an equivalent amount of emissions is prevented — by 2050.

What’s new in the 2025 Carbon Plan?

In its release, Duke Energy, said its most recent calculations, the raw data for which are not made public, reflect “rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.”

“Across the Carolinas,” the release said, “customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.”

To meet that need, Duke Energy proposes:

New nuclear-powered plants, including a large light-water reactor and/or small modular reactors, which would not come online until 2037 at the earliest.

The five new gas-powered plants it proposed in 2023 plus two additional combustion turbines for peak needs and additional storage for liquified natural gas to enhance reliability and guard against price volatility.

The plan includes some solar development and would increase battery storage capacity. It says that wind is “not an economically viable resource” for North Carolina customers through 2040 but says that will be reassessed at the next plan update.

The plan also calls for “maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators,” while extending the life of Duke’s coal-fired plants, citing the Trump administration’s plans to ease restrictions on coal.

The Environmental Protection Agency has said it wants to delay Biden-era restrictions on coal plants’ release of pollutants such as mercury and arsenic into waterways. The agency also wants to open up more than 13 million acres of now-protected federal land to coal leases, mostly in western states.

President Donald Trump’s Department of Energy also announced this week it will spend $625 million to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry,” more than half of it on recommissioning and retrofitting coal-fired power plants. The administration has said coal is needed to power the data centers that support AI.

North Carolina is home to 95 data centers, according to the tracking site datacentermap.com, with 39 clustered around the Charlotte area and 16 total in Raleigh and Durham.

The Energy Department also announced this week it’s canceling $7.56 billion in funding for 223 projects in the research and deployment of clean energy and other climate-friendly technology across the country but mainly in Democrat-led states, the Washington Post reported. That’s in addition to billions of dollars in earlier cuts to programs supporting green technology and renewable energy sources, and a proposal to rescind regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.

Environmental groups question Duke Energy’s math

At the inaugural meeting this week of Gov. Stein’s N.C. Energy Policy Task Force, delegates heard from experts around the country about the importance of reliable, affordable and safe energy sources. They also heard that estimating future electrical demands is tricky, because the main drivers — growth in manufacturing, data centers and population — are hard to predict.

Even after a manufacturing plant has broken ground, plans can change; Vietnamese carmaker VinFast now says its Chatham County facility won’t open until 2028.

Watchdog and environmental groups such as the Sierra Club say that because Duke Energy gets paid a premium on construction costs, the company maximizes profits by building big centralized power plants that rely on polluting technology other utilities and countries are trying to phase out.

“Duke is a monopoly utility that has shareholders and they are guaranteed a rate of return on things that they build, so there is incentive for them to build things,” said Mikaela Curry, manager of the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign.

But what’s good for a company’s profits “is not always good for the families and rate-payers of North Carolina.”

Jim Warren, executive director of NC Warn, said Duke Energy also has an incentive to overestimate the amount of electricity that will be needed in the future to justify additional construction, the cost of which is passed on to rate-payers. NC Warn has challenged Duke Energy in the past over plans to add nuclear reactors at its Shearon Harris plant in New Hill, southwest of Raleigh.

Duke’s new resource plan “continues the horrible record of one of the world’s worst climate polluters,” Warren said. “Duke proposes to greatly increase methane gas for power and experimental nuclear plants while extending its burning of coal for at least 15 years. The plan slashes projections for large-scale solar and continues its suppression of rooftop solar. This would put billions into the rate system, leading power bills to double or triple over time while driving even more weather disasters that are devastating North Carolina communities.

“We call on Governor Stein and other state leaders to denounce and rein in this out-of-control corporate monopoly.”

Warren said that even if Duke’s estimates about rapid future growth in manufacturing pan out, the utility and state legislators could create incentives for companies to install solar collection and battery systems that would reduce strain on the electrical grid and provide some security against outages.

“Solar is the cheapest form of electricity ever created,” Warren said. Especially in cases where the state offers incentives for companies to locate here, Warren said, “There should be a requirement that these places use some of their investment up front to make their facilities as self-generating as possible in terms of their energy use. Why wouldn’t you? You have all these huge buildings and the roofs and walls and parking areas are empty. We should be having solar and storage put on all these places.”

What happens next with the Carbon Plan?

The N.C. Utilities Commission will schedule a public comment period and hearings on the Carbon Plan and issue and order on the plan by Dec. 31, 2026.

Fleets of batteries are now performing like gas plants, virtual power plants are dispatched daily, and hyperscalers are supporting new models to finance capacity around their data centers.

But investor-owned utilities? The Edison Electric Institute says they’re planning more than a trillion dollars in new infrastructure over the next decade to support historic load growth — with no mention of DERs or flexibility as solutions.

So which world are we living in? The one where DERs become essential infrastructure, or the one where they remain a rounding error for utilities?

This week, we examine this critical moment for distributed resources. Tim Hade, a co-founder of Brightfield Infrastructure and former COO of Scale Microgrids, joins us to talk about the tug-of-war at the heart of the grid transition.

We unpack a recent historical overview of DERs from Andy Lubershane, who argues that technical innovation and the desperate rush to meet load growth is turning them from nice-to-have experiments into distributed capacity resources that grid operators can actually count on.

We also dig into EEI’s new report on utility planning, and examine why utilities still resist DERs even as customers and data centers push them forward. What are the consequences of ignoring them at this precarious moment when power prices are rising quickly?

Transcript

Stephen Lacey: It’s pretty wild that we’ve been recording together long enough that Tim is back on the show after almost a decade. Tim, how’s the last decade gone for you?

Tim Hade: Oh, wow. Well, hey, listen, first things first, I think this should be the cold open. I want to say this, I’m so grateful to be here today, and as I’ve told you many times privately, this show and its predecessor show has had such a profound impact on me professionally and I’ve learned so much from you all over the years, and I’m very grateful to Jigar for his service but I’m also happy he’s returned from his sabbatical and is back to being a ruthless capitalist. So, that’s good.

Jigar Shah: We’re definitely going to cut that statement out.

Stephen Lacey: He’s trying to butter you up, Jigar. He’s wearing a shirt that says, “Deploy,” with Jigar’s face on it.

Tim Hade: That is true.

Katherine Hamilton: You don’t realize this is a hostage video.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. This week, are DERs about to become essential infrastructure or will they stay stuck at the margins? Distributed resources have never looked stronger, for the first time fleets of batteries are performing like gas plants, virtual power plants are getting dispatched every day, and data centers are seeing them as a real capacity resource. But at the same time, the gatekeepers, utilities, regulators, even officials in California are acting like they’re still optional. Utilities are planning well over a trillion dollars of infrastructure in the next few years, but they still aren’t prioritizing DERs. So, are these resources about to finally break through or get sidelined again?

Welcome to the show, I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m the executive editor at Latitude Media. I am here as always with Jigar Shah and Katherine Hamilton. Katherine is the co-founder and chair of 38 North Solutions. Hey Katherine.

Katherine Hamilton: Good morning. I’m so excited to do this with one of our best friends.

Stephen Lacey: Yes. And Tim is an advisor for 38 North Solutions. Is that right?

Tim Hade: Senior advisor, thank you very much.

Katherine Hamilton: Does that just mean you’re old? What does that mean?

Stephen Lacey: What differentiates between advisor and senior advisor?

Jigar Shah: You have to be on the Energy Gang at least twice, or now Open Circuit to be able to be called a senior advisor.

Tim Hade: That’s it, that’s right. That’s right.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar is the co-founder of Multiplier, and the former director of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. How’s it going, Jigar?

Jigar Shah: Oh, fantastic.

Stephen Lacey: Excellent. Well, joining us is Tim Hade, the voice you heard. He’s the co-founder of Brightfield Infrastructure. Tim was also the co-founder and COO of Scale Microgrids, which he recently departed after the company was acquired this year, and he is a well-known DER evangelist and entrepreneur in the space. Tim, welcome.

Tim Hade: Thank you all so much for having me, I’m stoked to be here.

Stephen Lacey: I want to start with a little story that you told that last year’s DERVOS conference. I was not at the show but I watched the video afterward, and what some people might not know is that you were an officer in the Air Force, and in your keynote you relayed this story from when you were in the Air Force, that you heard when you were in the Air Force, about FDR and Henry Ford during World War II. And I think it’s a great story that maybe sets the stakes for what we’re talking about today. Tell us that story quickly and what it says about the moment.

Tim Hade: So, I guess first of all, this is a great opportunity to plug the upcoming DERVOS conference, that this year is being co-sponsored by yours truly, Jigar Shah. October 16th I think there’s still a limited number of tickets available, and if you care about DERs that’s the place to be. With due respect to the Latitude Media conferences, that is my favorite conference of the year.

Jigar Shah: I think you got that wrong, Tim. The advertisement should go like Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

Tim Hade: 100%. But yeah, look, I think the main point that I was talking about last year, and DERVOS last year was shortly before the election, was that in order for the United States to lead the energy transition and address the climate crisis, we really needed a public-private partnership. And the story that you mentioned was basically in the lead-up to World War II the German ambassador came to the White House and was basically like, “We build more bombers than the United States and don’t mess around.” And FDR sat there and listened, and then the German ambassador left the White House. FDR got on a plane, flew to Detroit, met with Henry Ford, who he didn’t like and they didn’t have the same sort of political leanings, and hadn’t talked in like 20 years, and they made this deal. And then, shortly thereafter, the Willow Run plant in the Ford Motor Company’s Willow Run plant was producing more bombers a day than the entire country of Germany.

And the thesis of my talk was that if we’re going to do this it has to be a public-private partnership. And then the election happened. And so, I don’t know, candidly this year has been a journey for me, because I think my view on this is the sad reality of the situation is that we’re not going to have that type of public-private partnership for the foreseeable future. So, now we’re in a position where my view is the U.S. energy transition is going to be private sector led, private sector enabled. And look, I think the good news about that is I know how to make people money, and our industry knows how to make people money. And so, I think there’s still a path and it’s not the path that I would’ve chosen, but I think we as an industry are resilient, and the leaders in this space are figuring things out, and figuring out how to pivot and move and adapt to this new environment.

And look, I think there’s a lot of reason for optimism. There’s headwinds that we’re facing, for sure, but there are also a lot of tailwinds, and I think we’re going to have a big next few years and we’ll see what happens.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I loved that story, and I think that’s a really important take on what’s happening now. So, we brought you here because it couldn’t really be a better time to talk about what’s happening in DERs right now. There’s a really interesting conversation going on about the role of distributed energy resources. I mean, this is a conversation we’ve had for 10 years or more, but there is a bunch of stuff that’s happening that I think makes it important to revisit this conversation explicitly. So, I think it’s really well framed out in a couple of pieces of writing that show the two ends of the spectrum. So Andy Lubershane, who is a partner and head of research at Energy Impact Partners, recently published this stellar piece on his Substack called Steel for Fuel. And his argument is basically that DERs have always been the right idea, but they were the right idea at the wrong time.

And 10 years ago when you were on the show with us previously, Tim, at that time the grid didn’t need them as much. They were still fairly expensive, but now everything has flipped. Demand from data centers, extreme weather, transmission bottlenecks, have utilities desperate for capacity, while of course batteries and other tech have gotten a lot more cheap and reliable. And he says that DERs are now turning into distributed capacity resources with this on off switch that grid operators can actually count on like real power plants. So, there’s a great interview with him on the September 18th edition of Catalyst, it’s a really superb breakdown of the history and evolution. But then when you go to the latest financial review from the Edison Electric Institute, which is basically a snapshot of where the money is going in the utility sector, it’s like DERs don’t exist at all. And the headline number is staggering.

Utilities plan to spend more than a trillion dollars this decade, the biggest investment wave in their history. And when you look closer, almost all of that is going into concrete and steel transmission lines, substations, plants, utility-owned storage, and what you don’t see in that document at all are virtual power plants, customer-sided batteries, flexible loads. So, I think this gets to the tension of what we’re going to talk about today, are living in a world where DERs are finally becoming essential infrastructure? Is the moment now? Or in EEI’s world where there’s still a rounding error. Katherine, which do you think is more representative of reality?

Katherine Hamilton: So, I’m going to go in the way back machine because Andy’s not been alive as long as I have, to when I was working for utility and I was designing systems for grids there, and DERs were absolutely crucial. And the reason was that load was growing, faster than we could manage it. And we had plenty of supply side, we had a nuke, we had pump storage, but we did not have enough substations. So, to buy us time to building substations, this was really on the distributed side, we had TOU rates, we had thermal energy storage rates. I was learning how to design ice systems for schools and hospitals. We had demand response programs, very sophisticated. This is the late 1980s, early 1990s. And what is consistent with that and what we’re facing right now is the utility.

The utility got to decide, “We need this, this is what we’re going to do.” They know how to do this. And the reason, Andy makes some great points about why things have or haven’t moved forward, but I think consistently it has to do with the utility and whether the utility wants it, and needs it, and is willing to monetize it or not.

Stephen Lacey: So Jigar, when you look at EEI’s report and you see almost no mention of distributed resources, and then you look at all the activity that we’re going to talk about on the show, what do you make of those two very different realities?

Jigar Shah: Oh, this is going to be fun.

Stephen Lacey: Meaning what?

Jigar Shah: You have a New Jersey Governor’s race right now where electricity rates are a top three issue. When you talk to the head of the Republican Party in Virginia, he’s like, “I have never seen energy be a number one issue in a gubernatorial race.” Like it’s on. The notion that utilities can just raise rates indiscriminately by 10% a year, that these utility CEOs who are basically just glorified head of a regulatory commission, they should get paid exactly what the head of the airport authority, or the water and sewer authority, or the transit authority get paid. But no, these guys think that they’re worth $26 million a year and they’re going to basically put one in six people in their territory such that they can’t afford electricity bills? The buzzsaw that’s coming for them right now is sharp, and it is going to cut right through them. I am very worried about the utility monopoly franchise itself. That’s how pissed off everybody is right now.

Stephen Lacey: There was this time around the 2015, 2016 timeframe when everyone was talking about the utility death spiral, and Andy points this out in that piece of history. Do you think we’re-

Jigar Shah: We’re still there.

Stephen Lacey: Do you think we’re overselling it?

Jigar Shah: No, we’re still there. I just want to make sure that people understand that in California, SoCal Gas has put forward a proposal to the Public Service Commission that says that they want to take all industrial clusters in California off grid based on Duncan’s paper. So, they’re just going to make it solar plus battery storage plus simple cycle gas plants-

Stephen Lacey: When you say Duncan’s paper, you’re talking about his solar microgrids paper that we talked about a couple months ago.

Katherine Hamilton: Duncan Campbell.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah.

Jigar Shah: Yeah. So, Duncan Campbell at Scale. So, now you’re at a place where the gas company is saying that they want to eviscerate the sales of the electric utility company in a formal filing with the Public Service Commission because they believe that doing this de novo would give you 11 cent per kilowatt-hour rates for industrial clusters. I don’t think people understand that the death spiral is real. The death spiral is defined by if people believe that they can generate their own power instead of being part of a system that supports each other, which is what I support, to be clear, I don’t want a death spiral. I want people to be part of a greater system of resiliency, but at some point you give people no choice.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and remember, the reason we didn’t have the utility death spiral per se was because utilities are very organized, and they figured out a way to try to make money and to keep DERs completely out of the market. So they said, “All right, we’re not going to interconnect anything, and we’re going to not compensate anybody for anything, and we’re going to make aggregation of resources illegal. We’re going to do that.” In 16 states they were simply made illegal. So, they have been the ones who have been putting barriers up all along and now all of a sudden they’re like, “Oh, we need to raise our rates.” So, it’s really the ISOs fault, not our own fault that this is happening. But the utilities are very, very organized about this and they’ve been consistent, their messaging has been strong. And you can see, as you referenced, Stephen, in the EEI report, they’re all in lockstep.

Stephen Lacey: Tim, what did you make of Andy Lubershane’s thesis? I know you read it and it was resonating with you. What do you think he got right about the history, and to Katherine’s point, the role of utilities in delaying the deployment of DERs?

Tim Hade: Yeah, so I mean, I guess to begin with, I think Andy’s brilliant and he’s one of the best people I have ever met at synthesizing complex ideas. And so, I would encourage everyone to go read his piece that was put up on LinkedIn a few weeks ago. But look, I think the thing that I would maybe branch off from Andy on is I think he is very conservative with respect to how he talks about the macro situation. And so look, to put it simply I think the U.S. electric grid sucks. And before I get a bunch of emails from retired utility CEOs, look, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave us a D plus this year on the electric grid. I think the World Economic Forum ranked America as having the 19th best electricity system. So, I remember when I was a kid and we were like, “America’s number 19,” and celebrated.

We’re in a situation now where one in five, one in six Americans can’t afford to pay their electricity bills. There’s really nothing that’s happening that gives me any confidence that electric rates are going to come back down to earth or rate inflation is going to come back down to earth. So Brian Deese, who I think was on the show a few months ago, wrote a piece in foreign affairs calling this an electricity crisis. Certainly in the state I live, in in California, the word electricity crisis is thrown around quite regularly. And so listen, I think what we’re watching play out in real time is the electricity system is failing. And so, what I think utilities generally miss about this moment is they don’t have a choice on DER’s. DER’s are inevitable, what we’re talking about is the timeframe. And so, one of two things is going to happen.

Utilities are either going to use DER’s to prevent the electric grid from failing, or the electric grid is going to fail and then people are going to deploy DER’s. And either way, DER’s are going to get deployed. And so, I think to Jigar’s point, what a lot of people in our industry are trying to work on right now is preventing failure from happening. Let’s try to get ahead of this as much as we can and make good things happen before people have to pay the price. But look, I don’t think that’s happening fast enough. The one thing I’ll say is that, and I know you guys make this distinction all the time on the show, it’s hard to talk about utilities as a monolith. And so, the EEI has their perspective on things, but there are good utilities out there that are Incorporating DER’s into their integrated resource planning and things like that.

And I think what you’re seeing is that the utilities that are leading on that front are generally providing a better service to their customers than utilities that aren’t. And so again, I think generally speaking this is heading in the right direction, but it’s not happening fast enough, and if we don’t pick up the pace we’re going to see big consequences. And again, I think you guys talked to Charles about this the other week, and I listened, and thought he had some really good points about this, but ultimately people care about electricity. This is the most important thing that’s the foundation of the future of our economic growth. And when that system fails, people are going to care about it. And so, the question is when do we get to the point where normal people start to really care about this? And to Jigar’s point, I think we’re getting there.

This is a big thing in New Jersey, this is a big thing in Virginia, this is a big thing in California. Normal people who aren’t part of the electricity industry who don’t own Jigar Shah paraphernalia are really starting to care about this. And just walking around town in Santa Barbara, people come up to me all the time and ask me, “Why is my electric bill $600 a month when it was $300 a month four years ago?” Or, “Hey, what happened in LA? Can that happen here? I don’t feel safe when the wind blows,” and things like that. This is becoming a kitchen table issue, and I think things like what Katherine’s doing at Common Charge and a lot of other initiatives in the country are coming together to give people a voice. And so look, I think ultimately the message to utilities is you don’t have a choice about this. Either get on board or the electric grid is going to fail and then you’ll get on board afterwards. And I hope we can avoid that.

Katherine Hamilton: To speak a little bit to common charge, Tim, you’re totally right. We did just a soft launch and I had so much outreach from small businesses, from homeowners, from people of all walks of life, all regions of the country saying, “This is a major issue for you.” And we really are at this acute point where we have to start dealing with affordability and with reliability. And that’s where all of this conversation about DERs, which Andy talks about so well, really comes to the fore.

Jigar Shah: Can I say it maybe a slightly different way, which is that we were at roughly 60% asset utilization as a country for the assets that the utility operates in 2000, 2001. Today we’re at 40% asset utilization. So, that means that we have built a lot of stuff and not enough kilowatt-hours are going through that stuff. And so, every kilowatt-hour that goes through it has to pay more to pay for it. And so, we are in a magical place right now with load growth where we can resolve that situation, get back to 60% utilization by 2030, but the only way to do that is to take the EEI report and say, “Half of that is necessary maintenance, need to do it, stuff is old, it has to be replaced. And half of that is optional.” And the optional stuff can be better served at 90% discount to what you were going to do with DERs.

That’s the moment we’re in right now. And if you fail to meet the moment because you insist on investing a trillion or $1.1 trillion, then you’re going to make electricity so unaffordable that the DERs are going to be the cheapest way for people to serve themselves. And so, that I think is what’s in front of us. And I would say that as someone who has talked to the vast majority of CEOs and CFOs of the electric utility industry in 2024, given the energy and infrastructure reinvestment program that I was running for a loan programs office, I’d say almost all of them get it, but their middle management is fighting at tooth and nail. Their public policy people are fighting at tooth and nail, old habits die hard. I don’t think that the CEOs and CFOs are the ones that are not on board, because Wall Street has already told them that, “We’re worried about your Monopoly franchise. We’re worried that governors are going to go to extreme measures to make sure that this gets solved politically.”

Stephen Lacey: So, let’s talk about some of those potential consequences. You talked about the potential disconnection of industrial loads, you talk about it forcing more deployment of distributed resources, creating more competition. You talked about potential political outcomes, threatening the business model of the utility. Unpack which of those you think is the biggest threat for utilities right now if they don’t embrace this suite of solutions. It feels like we’re talking a very different language, by the way. You read the EEI report, they’re just in a completely different world and they’re really psyched about all this load growth because they’re going to build a lot more stuff. But talk about the potential consequences. Which of those you think are most acute if they continue to ignore them, these resources?

Jigar Shah: So I mean, I think we should balance the conversation from within the PJM Governors’ conference that happened last Monday. And so, you’re in a place where all these governors went on stage led by Shapiro, but then you had Wes Moore and Governor Youngkin from Virginia, et cetera, and they basically issued a veil threat that they’re going to leave the PJM. And the reason that they did that is because they believe that their populous wants them to be tough against the PJM. Make no mistake that it’s the dumbest idea ever to leave the PJM. It is so much better for everybody that we’re sharing power between Illinois and Virginia, so let’s just be clear. Then you follow up with all of these super smart people, some not so smart, that work for the governor. And you say, “What are your list of demands, right? You’ve issued a veil threat, what is it that you want the PJM to do differently?”

Zero demands. Not just bad demands, zero demands. So Shapiro made earlier demands, which is that we want to cap the capacity auction results, we want create a tighter window within which they operate. But if you ask them, “Have you demanded that the PJM implement FERC Order 2222? Have you demanded that they do grid enhancing technologies to expand the amount of capacity in the current grid that they’re operating? Do you actually want them to implement, connect and manage like we have in Texas so you can bring new assets on board faster?” So, you’re not guaranteeing them transmission capacity, you’re just guaranteeing that the new asset is safe to add to the grid, and then if they get curtailed, they get curtailed. These are all things they could have demanded, but they don’t know enough to demand these things.

And then when you talk to their public service commission, their public service commission’s like, “Look, it’s not my job to micromanage the utility.” They’re supposed to submit a rate case, I’m supposed to review it, and sometimes I push back on certain things, which is what Marissa Gilbert was doing in Connecticut, and the utility hated her so much that they spread nasty stories about her and got her fired last week. And so, now the utility is going after their regulator, after the judge that is supposed to oversee them because they don’t like how they’re being regulated. And so, we are in a period of maximum discord. The governors don’t know what to ask for, the regulators are saying, “It’s not our job to micromanage the utilities,” and the utilities are in la-la land saying nothing is wrong.

Katherine Hamilton: Well, they also would love to blame the ISO too. They would love to say it’s not their fault that their rates are going up. Well, they’re causing us to have our rates go up. One of the things that Shapiro did demand was, and other states too, wanted to have more say on the PJM structure, the board. I mean, there’s something to be said about the ISOs and the way they function, and the way that they operate, which is the people who are members of the ISO, the companies that are members of the ISO, those are the supply side resources. Those are the resources on the grid so they’re the ones that have the say, not the homeowners and small businesses that are desperately trying to get into a VPP program to be bid into the market.

They just don’t have any power right now, so part of that is really a power structure that I could see having to be somehow rethought and reorganized. But being out of the market, as Jigar said, that would be really unhelpful to everyone, especially since Pennsylvania is a net exporter. Who’s going to buy their stuff if they’re not in a market?

Tim Hade: Yeah, I mean, just one of the things I think Jigar touched on that I think is really important for people to understand is I think people generally understand that state policy has a huge impact on energy markets. I think what’s been shocking to me over the past few years is how little the average state politician understands about the electricity system in general. And so, as an anecdote I was meeting with a fairly high ranking person in the California legislature a few weeks ago, and we were in the middle of talking about some complex electric grid issues. And she asked me, she was like, “Hey, can you just clarify the difference between the transmission and the distribution system for me real quick? I don’t really get that.” And I laughed, I thought it was a joke, but then I realized she was serious. And so, I explained it to her and we got where we needed to go.

But look, I think the thing people should understand about state assemblymen, and state senators, and legislators who are making a lot of these decisions is they have a lot on their plate. And I think until recently, electricity issues haven’t been at the top of the list in terms of things they’re worried about and things their constituents are worried about. And so, as we talked about in the beginning, that’s changing. And so, now these folks are learning about this stuff, and a lot of the rhetoric from utilities, and regulators, and ISOs, and RTOs, and all these folks about, “Hey, this isn’t possible to do, and we don’t know how to do this and we can’t do this,” people are getting smart about this stuff and they’re realizing that no, you actually can do it. There’s a ton of precedent for doing it.

Jigar in the loan programs office wrote this liftoff report, and this liftoff report, and this liftoff report, and it gives you all the information you need. And so, I think the difference between now and 10 years ago is that there’s a ton of evidence out there, and there’s a ton of credible work out there to show that a better way is possible. And so, I think we’re in this period right now where it’s just taking time to educate folks about what the solutions are, but those solutions are out there and people are going to find them. And so, I think that’s the case for optimism is that as this becomes a big issue and constituents care about it, and normal people care about it, and Charles keeps going on CBS and doing his thing, that’s right, that’s right. As people get educated about this, they’re going to demand a better product and I think we’re in the beginning stages of that happening. And the good news is there are better products out there.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I mean, I’ve talked to a lot of those legislators, as you know too, and I think what a lot of people have said to me is that basically the only way through this moment is through state legislatures. That what the utility CEOs and CFOs have said to me is that they’re never going to go to Wall Street on their own and say, “We’re going to deploy stuff that’s 90% cheaper.” That is never going to happen. And so, they’re like, “What we need you to do is to pass a law that forces us to do stuff that’s 90% cheaper, and then we can say there’s a law. I’m so sorry, but we have to comply with the law.” And the regulator’s like, “Yeah, once there’s a law and we have to implement it, well then we can implement a law. That’s something we can do.”

And the governors are like, “Yeah, we’re happy to think about putting that law into our package of bills in January 1st so that it’s more likely to get passed,” as opposed to it being some sort of grassroots bubbled up idea that then we’re being forced to sign this law. And so, you’re seeing a lot of governors talk about reaching out and saying, “Okay, I know I ignored you for the last four years, Jigar, but maybe we’ll think about writing a law together to put this forward,” which I’m excited about because I feel like we’re starting to get real traction from the governors and the legislators around actually putting a prescriptive set of solutions together.

Tim Hade: I don’t want people’s impression of this to be that my view is the DER industry is perfect and we’re batting 1,000, and we just need utilities to get out of our way and then everything will be great. One of the real problems we have as a DER industry is that I would say generally speaking we’re politically naive. And so I mean, you guys know all our friends who run these companies and they tend to be introverts who like sitting in front of AutoCAD and designing stuff, and doing weird things, and building cool projects and things like that. But again, the reality is, is that our future is going to be dictated at least in part by state legislators and state regulators. And to date, we as an industry haven’t done a really good job of investing and educating those people. And so, Jigar, and Tom Massie, and Katherine and all these people who are leaders in this industry have gone out and talked to so many companies about, “Hey, you need to put some money in the kitty so we can go and launch these programs, and educate folks and do things.”

And more times than not, people haven’t stepped up to the challenge. And so, there’s a price that you pay for this education, and we as an industry have to take that more seriously. And so, I think part of the problem is that people don’t know this stuff, and part of the problem is that we as an industry haven’t done a good job of teaching, and we have to get better at that, for sure.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, that is literally what you have devoted your career to. Does that reflect your reality?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, absolutely. Just so much education, and sometimes it feels like there’s so much on the other side of educating, the uneducating part of it, that it’s a hard battle to fight. I would say, I think we’re at a tipping point, which is what we’ve been talking about, that people are going to start demanding this stuff. They’re going to start saying, “You have to give us the keys, unlock the door so we can actually start participating and saving money, because we can’t afford to pay our bills.” And I would give an example, Jigar was talking about legislative initiatives, and I would just say there’s an interconnection technology company that was telling me the stories. It’s very simple, interconnection technology, very inexpensive, would be super easy for a customer to get either EV connection or solar connection. And they’ve done this, they’ve deployed it in multiple utility areas that have been open to it, but they recently went to two different utilities in two very different parts of the country.

And the utility each said individually the exact same language, “This is probably illegal so we can’t do it.” And it was like they had been given that phrase, just as they have been given the phrase cost shift, which is also ludicrous, to say, “This is illegal.” And this company said, “If all of this is outlawed, only the outlaws will have it,” and we need to make this legal. We need to not have a bunch of outlaws. But I’ll tell you what, they’re going to be. People are going to deploy DERs whether or not they’re given permission, we need to give them permission.

Stephen Lacey: One of the things that has changed is the comfort of certain utility teams in bringing these resources into the operations team. So, planning teams have gotten used to modeling a lot of solar on their grids, but it is only until recently that operations teams have been thinking about this stuff as delivered capacity. And so, I just wonder how significant you think that shift has been, and if these DERs are now turning into distributed capacity resources with batteries as a backbone, will that accelerate inside these historically skeptical operations teams inside utilities?

Tim Hade: Yes. Yeah, look, this is an important thing I think, for people to understand about the technical journey that we’ve been on is what’s happened in the battery energy storage industry over the past decade has been remarkable. And so, when I was starting Scale in 2015, I would talk to engineers all the time and I would say, “Hey, I want to build a solar storage microgrid.” And they would be like, “Storage doesn’t work, it’s not a real thing.” And now it’s a very, very, very real thing. Battery costs at the cellular level are down 40% year over year this year delivered CNI systems, which is what I spend a lot of time procuring, are down 20%. The economic value proposition of batteries as a capacity resource is an absolute no-brainer in a lot of areas of the country. It’s not everywhere, but it’s a lot of places.

And so again, I think at some point the math just gets so obvious that people can’t ignore it anymore. And I think we’re at that point, we’ve hit that tipping point where putting a Powerwall in your garage, or a Megapack outside your industrial facility is just an obvious economic value proposition for the end use customer. And so, that battery capacity is going to get deployed. And I think the real question is do we use that battery capacity intelligently to help improve the grid, or do we just let people do this sporadically on a case by case basis? And so, the thing I worry the most about in the DER industry is there are a lot of people who just think, “Let’s just let the electricity system continue to do what it’s doing. It’s going to fail, we have a better value proposition, we’ll come in and pick up the scraps.”

And I think really what that leads to is a very unjust system where Fortune 500 companies and rich people have solar panels on their roofs and batteries in their garages, and all that kind of stuff, and then people who don’t have the right credit score or enough money to put a down payment on a solar system are still paying the fixed cost of the grid. And we don’t want to live in that world. If you’ve ever been developing countries, that’s how it is in a lot of the developing world, and it sucks. And so again, I think the key for the folks that run the electric grid is this stuff is going to get deployed anyway, the question is how do you manage that deployment in a smart way so the benefits percolate across society and aren’t just concentrated in a certain sector of the economy?

Jigar Shah: Well, and the thing that I think is so important right now is that we have to understand that the utilities have a really rickety software system. They’re mostly on SAP and Oracle, which are really terrible. And so, the way Oracle has built themselves is they just bolt on companies that, they just buy companies and then they just have this bandaging system. And so as a result, the operations people can’t do the things we’re asking them to do. So, if you ask them to integrate smart meter data into their operations, they don’t know how to do that work. It’s not possible. The vast majority of utilities don’t have a DERMS platform by which to dispatch DERs. And so, the reason why Dana Guernsey at Voltus, or the folks at C-Power or others are doing such a good job is they’ve just created an entirely parallel effort.

So, every time they build a commercial system, they have their own metering system that’s revenue grade on that system that they pay for separately so they can actually settle their dispatch with the PJM or whatever it is, and they can respond to a signal, which is not cost-effective to do for residential. And so, the weird thing is in this moment is that the one technology that can solve all the utilities problems happen to be AI. What AI does for a living, I don’t believe in AGI and all this other crap, but it’s very obvious that what AI is, is 20,000 paralegals that you can get for 20 bucks a month. So, the utilities have enormous amounts of unstructured data by which they can’t make any decisions. AI can turn those data sets into decisionable data sets. That’s what ThinkLabs does, that’s what all these other groups do inside the utility.

So, when you think about the key to OpenAI being successful as a business, it’s actually having a real paying customer that is worth serving. Right now every time they serve them, they lose money every transaction, but this is a use case where they could make a crap load of money. And so, we’re in this moment where it’s, I don’t know what’s going to happen. Does the utility actually want to solve this problem, or do they not want to solve this problem? Because my experience is the distribution people at the utility are in the basement. They do not have nice views of the park, they don’t actually have the right floor. They’re like, “Where’s your office?” “Oh, we’re in the parking garage.” And so, in this moment everything the utility does is utility scale generation, upgraded transmission, upgraded distribution, serve the load. It is clearly way cheaper just to figure out how to serve the load at the distribution line. And all the tools are there now, all the tools are available. And Lord Almighty, is this going to be a cultural shift.

Tim Hade: This is actually one of the things I’m really excited about with the hyperscalers getting involved in this industry, because I think what Jigar said is 100% true, which is one of the problems with integrating DERs into utility systems is utility software is archaic in a lot of cases. And so, now all of a sudden you have this situation where the customers who care most about utilities fixing their situation are literally software engineers. And so, the utilities come to Amazon, or Google goes to the utility and they’re like, “Hey, we need X megawatts of capacity to be able to build our data center.” And the utility is like, “Oh, we can’t do that.” And Google’s like, “Well, why don’t you just put batteries all over the city and then we can do it?” And the utility is like, “Oh, we don’t have the software capability.” And Google’s like, “What are you talking about? We could fix that problem for you in eight seconds.”

And so, now you have these people who have deep understanding of what’s capable in a software world and AI enabled software world who are coming to the table and helping to solve these problems. And I think you’re starting to see a lot of really cool pilots that are partnerships between tech and utilities rolling out across the country. And I think those programs are going to be really successful, because now the tech companies who have the most resources to be able to upgrade utility software and address these problems have a seat at the table and a deep concern about this issue. And so, I think that’s one of the reasons for optimism. My bet is that utility distributed energy resource management software platforms are going to get a lot better over the next two, three years.

Katherine Hamilton: So the other piece of that, and Tim, I totally agree, and with Jigar as well about the software piece, is that that does not just affect the utility operation but also affects the ISO. And that’s part of what the disconnect is, is that with order 2222 in which DERs are supposed to be able to actually completely participate in the markets, it’s taking forever because of all these software updates, and it’s software updates that have to do with the bidding parameters, all the information and data that they need from all the DERs, what are the locational requirements? What are all the different nodes that they need to pull in? Metering and telemetry requirements. And all this coordination has to be done with the utility.

So, you have an issue with utility and the data that they have, which I would argue they have a ton of data, they just don’t know how to use it, and then conveying that and coordinating very closely with the ISO, that is the way DERs are going to become really unlocked is to actually be able to monetize those wholesale markets that will bring down, put downward pressure on prices that will go to everybody in the ISO and all of the customers in the utility side.

Stephen Lacey: Let’s go to a couple other stories here. I want to turn to California. We hinted at this story previously. California has historically been great at promoting DERs but awful at utilizing them. We’ve railed about this previously on the show, but it is now potentially defunding this VPP program called DSGS. Katherine, how much of a blow is this to the market in California?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, it’s ridiculous. It’s the demand side grid support program, and what it allowed was for existing assets, like not new stuff but existing distributed assets that were out there to be brought together in virtual power plants to really solve some of the most crucial issues, peak demand and other events on the grid. They were extremely successful, there were hundreds of thousands of customers participating, almost 550 megawatts brought to the grid in a way that was really, really effective. And it was companies like Sunrun and Tesla who knew how to do that and were able to monetize it. And what happened is that in the budget, they only have about 15 million left for this program and they need about 75 million to make it work. So, that’s been part of the issue.

They think they might be able to get a billion or compete for a billion out of the cap and trade fund in the reserve, but it is a blow because it’s a program that was actually working in solving some issues on the grid, and allowing customers to participate. And it was unlocking these resources that were sitting there not being as useful or effective for the grid as they could be. So, I’m sure Tim has a lot of stories about it too, but it seemed one of those things that’s a penny-

Jigar Shah: Penny wise.

Katherine Hamilton: Penny wise, dollar foolish.

Jigar Shah: I’m torn about this thing. The DSGS program basically is a program that’s designed to be the quintessential, “We are incompetent so this is what we’re going to do,” program. Because you can imagine the CCAs, the community choice aggregators, have to buy resource adequacy so they could pay for these batteries right now that they’ve already been geotagged and allocated here. You have this emergency load response program that they could get paid by, the California ISO could pay them under FERC Order 2222, but the California Public Service Commission has deliberately sandbagged that program by making the effective load carrying capacities that they calculate for the California ISO program impossibly low so that nobody can make money in that program. And so, you basically have all this dysfunction up and down the state of California, so they’re like, “Screw it, we’re not going to fix anything. Let’s just pay them through the DSGS program.”

And that bothers me to no end, because along the way we’re just goal plating everything in California. We continue to keep building out new distribution grids because we refuse to use DERs to make those grids run more efficiently. Some of the grids in California are down at 15% capacity utilization. At some point you’re like, “What are we doing?” And so, I’d like to actually solve the underlying problem, which is that the state of California has a CPUC which hates DERs, and the staff that work there, which by the way is 650 people on the electricity side, they’ve got 1,200 people with gas and everything else, largest public service commission in the entire United States thinks that what consumers want is dynamic pricing. So, they hate DERs and they hate aggregators. And they’re like, “What we need is to give people a different price every five minutes of the day, and make them check their app before they turn on their dishwasher.”

And I was like, “In what freaking world do you have a job? I don’t understand how you even are employed here.” And so, the DSGS’s program is fine, but it’s a bandaid to the fact that the state of California can’t figure out what Texas has done, and actually just integrate decision making for the DERs and how they get paid through a stacking of multiple different revenue streams from all these different things that they could do to make things more affordable in the state of California.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and they’ve hated demand response like forever, since the beginning of time they’ve hit a demand response. Like a very simple tool.

Tim Hade: Yeah, all right. So, I guess before I talk about the state of California, it’s probably worth noting that I live in the state of California. And-

Jigar Shah: Is Santa Barbara the state of California? It feels like its own little enclave.

Tim Hade: Some have called it a bubble. Look, I think one of the caveats is before I ever talk about the problems with the California energy system, I do think it’s important to note that California has done more than any state on climate leadership, and I don’t think it’s close. And so, if you think about the history of the solar industry, the wind industry, the battery industry, the EV industry, so much has been done in this state to move those technologies forward and a lot of other states are benefiting from the early work that was done in the state of California. With that said, California has the worst electric grid in the United States and it’s not close. And so, you look at any metric, reliability, resilience, price, it’s terrible. I think in my county of Santa Barbara, one in four people can’t afford their electricity bills, one in four households. So, it’s bad on a national basis, it’s worse in California.

Average retail rates here for residential customers in my area are like 35 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is, I don’t know, two and a half times the national average. And it’s like a safety issue. And so, again, I guess there’s still a court case going on, but potentially the electric grid burned down Pasadena. And so, I think we’re in this situation now where California is the Normandy for this issue nationally, where look, I think the average person I know in the state of California, part of the problem with this is it’s so confusing, and it’s complicated, and people don’t understand the difference between a kilowatt and a kilowatt-hour, and how does any of this stuff work? But what they know is that we’ve been listening to the same people in this state for 20 years, and the result is we have the worst electricity system in the country.

And so, now you have this whole other group of people on the sidelines who have been saying, “Hey, there’s a better way to do this,” over and over and over again, and being ignored. And I think normal people are just like, “Hey, let’s change direction.” And so look, I think the challenge with this is we talked about the education piece with the state legislature and the California Public Utility Commission, but look, ultimately from my view this is going to be a massive issue in the 2026 gubernatorial election. And I think in my mind there hasn’t been a governor who’s done a worse job on electricity policy than Gavin Newsom. And so, I think when we have this gubernatorial election, especially the Democratic primary, people are going to need to answer for that. And so, ultimately I think the gubernatorial candidates are going to have to get smart about this stuff in order to answer the questions people have about why is the system so bad.

And when they’re preparing for those questions, they’re going to find out that like, “Hey, there’s a lot of stuff that we can do to make this better that we’re just not doing because this person at the IBEW, or this person at XIOU doesn’t think it’s in their best interest for quarterly earnings,” or whatever the case might be. But this is going to come to a head, it’s coming to a head right now. And I think again, the good news is that we have a lot of companies in California, we have a lot of innovators in California. I think we’re going to get a shot to deploy this technology and show what it can do. And I think once we do that, people are going to find out we’re ready for this and we’re going to be able to build a better system. And so, part of the reason I live in California is because we have the worst electric grid in the country.

And again, you guys talked about this in terms of painkillers and vitamins, good electricity technology is a painkiller in California. And so, I think ultimately we’re going to get our shot on goal and we got to step up and meet the moment, and make sure we’re doing it the right way. I think once we do that, California is going to become a model for how you build the 21st century grid. At least that’s what I hope happens. And then, the rest of the country can steal our innovation again, and hopefully we land in a good place.

Stephen Lacey: Is there any lesson to take from California about how to fund these programs? So, we’ve learned throughout the history of solar in particular that these stop start programs are bad for the industry, we had early rebate programs that would sell out really quickly. How do you structure these programs so that you’re not at the whims of state politicians so that when they’re in this budget squeeze they don’t just strip funding out of your program? What’s a better way to fund these programs so that they’re market based and stacked appropriately?

Jigar Shah: Well, it depends on-

Tim Hade: Retail choice.

Jigar Shah: Look, I think it depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. So, obviously when you’re in the commercialization phase of a program, rebates and incentives are going to be critical because they’re clearly very expensive. I think the challenge you have in California is that that pivot to a market-based system is very hard when people get addicted to the rebates. So, when you look at Texas, Texas clearly was basically started as a market-based system. They had some wind mandates early on, but solar was really not allowed in Texas until it hit some sort of economic threshold, and then it was allowed to do as much as it wanted to do. And you’re starting to see the DER stuff because Texas unlocked a lot of the smart meter data early on, and is innovated in that area so that you could actually access a lot of the DER work. Whereas California has really been frustrated by entrenched interests.

I mean, you see with the NEM programs in California, we knew a long time ago that the net metering programs needed to be reformed in California, but they just had so much power that they were able to stave it off until they basically just went too far the other way, which is where you are now today. And so, I’m hopeful, and you see that when New York now, and New York has eviscerated the solar industry in New York and has not committed at all to doing any of the permitting reforms or other reforms that are required to cut the cost of doing business in the state of New York by half. And so, residential solar in Texas now is $1.90 a watt unsubsidized, and in New York it’s $4. And so, you’re in this weird spot where New York has not gotten the backlash that California got, but New York has done exactly the same thing to cut the legs out from underneath rooftop solar in that state.

And so, one of the big challenges that we have in front of us is as we commercialize these technologies, we have to figure out a really secure off-ramp for these subsidies as they get bigger and bigger, obviously as the technologies get deployed at more scale, and they get fully integrated into the way the utilities operate so you can get all the best benefits out of them.

Katherine Hamilton: Well, and you need open markets. So, the utilities in California fought against community solar to the point where it’s only going to be allowed by utilities, third parties can’t participate. And that’s where you get the benefits to customers is through third party programs because those third parties come in, they compete, they provide all of the benefits. Well, part of the benefits will go to themselves, but most of the benefits will go to the customer. Whereas of the utility, if they own it, it goes to the return on equity and to their shareholders. So, something has to also give in the utility, and maybe that’s through the legislature as you had mentioned earlier, Jigar, but we need to somehow break that so that we get the ability to have open and fair markets so customers and all of these DERs can actually participate.

Tim Hade: Yeah. And one other thing that I think is really problematic in California is the complexity of the market is mind-boggling. And so, almost no one understands how the electricity markets in California work. I’ll give you a distinct example. When I moved out here, I had to learn about resource adequacy, which is the capacity market in California. It cost me $150,000, something like that, in consulting fees to feel like I had a good understanding of the resource adequacy market, and I still don’t really understand it. And so, now I go out and I want to build a battery system, and I’m like, “Okay,” and my revenue streams are dependent on this abstract concept of a resource adequacy market. How do I think about how much money I’m going to make over the next 10 years? And it’s impossible to figure out. And by the way, trying to figure it out is dependent on do you think Diablo Canyon is going to get relicensed in 2032? That’s the underlying assumption in the model.

And so, none of these markets make sense to anyone. And so, ultimately you’re in this situation where you want to have utilities and the private sector working together to try to figure out how to deploy all these resources, and it’s really, really hard to do and no one understands what the market dynamics are. And I think honestly there’s some entrenched interests in Sacramento who like it that way, because there are six people in Sacramento who actually understand how this works, and that’s their competitive advantage. And so, when people like me want to understand it, I have to pay them a lot of money in order to explain it to me. But that’s not a good way to run a state electricity market. And so, I think ultimately one of the problems in California is like it’s way, way, way too complex.

We’re very, very good at writing laws, we’re not good at taking laws away. We’re very, very good at writing regulations, we’re not good at taking regulations away. And so, if you want to be an entrepreneur and into the electricity sector in California, I’ll print you out 100,000 pages of documents that you probably won’t understand anyway, and you have to read all those things and then guess. And so look, if you really want to create a vibrant market, people have to understand how that market works. And that’s a huge problem in California as people just don’t get it, and I’m one of those people.

Jigar Shah: Well, what’s so sad is that, as you know, we had that gathering of all those California companies a few months ago and they all basically said, “Yeah, we’re based here but we don’t do business here, and we’ll never do business here. So, we do business in Texas and Massachusetts, and all these other places, and we’re based here with our headquarters but we’ll never do business here.”

Stephen Lacey: That actually brings us nicely into something that you’ve been thinking a lot about, Tim, which is soft costs, the costs around permitting, customer acquisition, navigating the regulatory environment. That’s the stuff that hasn’t budged as hardware prices have fallen. And Tesla recently put out this report saying we could potentially lower residential soft costs by 40% with better automation. We’re seeing companies like Aurora Solar, 257 use AI to slash customer acquisition costs. And I know that this is something you’ve been looking into more. Why do you have soft costs on the brain?

Tim Hade: Yeah, so if you think about the problems with distributed energy, and there’s some stuff we own too, and I think Jigar wrote a LinkedIn post about this two or three weeks ago that’s really good and explains the issue in a very concrete way. The biggest problem with the distributed energy resources business model is soft costs. And so, if you think about a typical distributed energy resource project, it varies a little bit, whether it’s residential or commercial, what size of the commercial or whatever the case might be, 50% of the costs are not hardware installation. And so, the cost of putting solar on your roof in California, if you just look at hardware and installation is like two bucks a lot, something like that. The actual cost that the homeowner pays is four bucks a lot. And the difference between those two things is soft costs.

And we’ve known that as an industry for a long time, there just hasn’t been a clear solution. And then AI. And that’s the thing I’m most excited about with AI is AI is a really, really good way to reduce soft costs on these projects. And so, you think about the primary drivers of soft costs, legal, legal and contracting. Jigar mentioned it, it’s a lot easier for me to write a contract today than it was three years ago. Financial modeling, energy modeling, engineering, one line diagrams and things like that. Permitting. The town of Bakersfield, which isn’t considered one of the most innovative places in the state of California, just implemented AI the other week that allows you to get an instant permit to put solar on your roof or a battery on your property. All of these drivers of soft costs can basically be solved with AI.

And so, I think ultimately what you’re seeing is now we’re on this path where hardware costs are dropping, installation costs are going up a little bit, but soft costs are just being eviscerated. And I think in the distributed energy space, whoever wins on soft costs is going to win. So, you have a lot of innovative people in the space who are really taking this seriously and looking for every dollar, every cent that you can extract out of the installed cost of these projects, and how you can apply AI to these things, and the early results are phenomenal. I think Jigar was telling me he was talking to some companies that think they can reduce soft costs by 80% today by using sophisticated AI tools. I’ll take the over on that, I think in the work I’m doing, 30 to 50% is probably reasonable. But even then we just dropped the cost 30 to 50%. Then you’re in this environment where the hub of DERs moving forward is going to be batteries, and I think a pleasant surprise from the last year is that the battery ITC withstood the OBBB process.

And so, you didn’t even lose the battery tax credit, you lost the solar tax credit but you didn’t lose the battery tax credit. So, when you think about the installed cost of these systems, they’re plummeting at the same time retail rates are rising. And again, I think the industry in general is going to hit that tipping point where this stuff just becomes super obvious from an economic value proposition standpoint to off-takers. But then within the DER industry, the race right now is who can do the best job attacking soft costs? And I think there are a lot of people coming up with a lot of innovative solutions really, really quickly.

Stephen Lacey: I totally agree that this is one of the most important areas where AI can have an impact. And Jigar, I think I agree with your take earlier in the conversation. I share your skepticism around AGI, however the AI labs are defining that, but I think this is a very clear example where AI is very good at distilling data, synthesizing things, improving processes. I know to Tim’s point, you were writing about this, Jigar, I think you mentioned 257’s Pink platform that can cut acquisition costs by 33% for installers through automated outreach, prediction modeling. Aurora Solar has been using machine learning for years. How much are you seeing this actually impact soft costs now, Jigar?

Jigar Shah: Well, so EnergySage has put out these awesome reports every year, and certainly every quarter as well, and the last quarterly report they put out was right before RE+ and showed a huge decline actually in the average install cost of residential solar that it was tracking. I think it was like 14% or something. And so, one of the things that I did a lot at RE+ was just talk to a bunch of people when we put together events, and I’d say that something on the order of 20% of the industry is fully committed to this. They’re fully committed to hitting basically a $2 a watt benchmark residential system cost installation by the end of ’26. That’s going to change obviously, it’s $1.90 in Texas and maybe 2.45 a watt in Massachusetts, but they’re committed to whatever that equivalent number looks like for their region and their state, which is not nothing.

And I do think that the other people may not come along and they may all go out of business, and then the people who decided to do this will take up their market share. So, I think like most things in life in solar, the people who are willing to innovate and actually push the envelope are going to have much larger businesses, and the people who want to do things the exact same way they did last year will go out business, and the solar industry megawatts will still go up into the right. So, I think the industry is going to continue to deploy more technology and more panels and all that stuff as ever before. And unfortunately, you might have a bunch of people who go out of business because they decide that they don’t want to commit to the number of changes required to make this a reality.

But I do think in this moment you have 25% rate increases across the country the last four years, you have another 25% rate increases that are coming over the next four years. I mean, solar’s never been more cost-effective. And as Tim suggested, and Katherine has said multiple times, battery storage, I mean, is the bacon of the grid. And so, at some point people want more bacon.

Katherine Hamilton: Every single kind of distributed energy asset company should be using AI to squeeze every kind of efficiency out of their processes no matter what they are. I mean, the ones that do that are going to succeed and be more cost competitive than others. Definitely on the regulatory front I think it’s obviously going to be a little bit slower, it’s a higher risk environment, and I think that it’ll just take a little bit longer. But if you have the DER companies doing this and becoming very cost-effective, as long as the structures are enabling those to be unlocked and allowing customers to participate in a market, that’s going to be what’s needed. And then, hopefully we’ll be able to show the way to the regulators that, and to those who are, for example, processing permits and all of that, that has to be done on a local level, that we can kind of de-risk it so they can feel comfortable.

Jigar Shah: The one other thing that’s happening, which I think people are not paying enough attention to, is that people have gotten super smart about how to get around the regulations. So, like Carrier just announced that they’re putting a battery in their HVAC unit, and what that allows you to do is to just take away the ramp because when you’re turning on an air conditioner you have a huge amount of inflow current. And so, they get rid of that by having the battery. But magically, by having a battery in your HVAC system, there are no interconnection rules whatsoever or permitting requirements. And so, they control 100 gigawatts of HVAC load in the country. So, as all of those HVAC units are being replaced and they replace them with a battery in there, that’s 100 gigawatts worth of demand response that Carrier now controls.

Now look at Copper and what they’re doing in their induction stove. They’ve got a battery in there, there’s no permitting or interconnection requirements needed to put in a Copper stove. And guess what? I’m pretty sure next week someone’s going to come out with a battery inside their water heater. And when that happens, no permitting and interconnection requirements there either. And so, I just think this is going to be awesome.

Stephen Lacey: All right, guys, let’s round this out. So Tim, we talked to you almost 10 years ago. Hopefully we’ll have you on the show in less time than that, but let’s say we talk again in 10-

Tim Hade: I only do once a decade. Once a decade.

Jigar Shah: That’s in my contract, sir.

Stephen Lacey: So, we’re having this conversation in another decade, what is the optimistic scenario for DERs that you think could play out? Look, we were all feeling pretty optimistic about DERs 10 years ago, the utilities did everything they could to stall the transition. There wasn’t the same urgent need for these resources. We saw a lot of really interesting concepts developed but not deployed. So, 10 years from now are we going to be having a materially different conversation? We’ll go down the line with each of you.

Tim Hade: Look, I think what I know or what I deeply believe is that what we do in the electricity sector over the next decade is going to define America in a lot of different ways on a global stage over the course of my lifetime. And whether that’s from a climate perspective or a national security perspective, or a not losing the AI race to China perspective, which I guess is also national security, this stuff is really, really important. What I’m also convinced of is that the future of electricity systems will be wireless. We’re heading towards a world without wires. And the activity that I always ask people to go to when they tell me I’m crazy about that is just imagine the best possible version of the electricity grid. Why would we have wires? You would just have buildings that made their own power, and vehicles that made their own power and all this type of stuff, and you wouldn’t need thousands of miles of transmission lines, and distribution lines and all that kind of stuff.

And that’s going to happen. I don’t know whether that’s going to happen in 100 years, or 200 years, or 300 years, but the electricity system is 120 years old. We’re still in the infancy of this. And the idea that the way this currently works is going to be the way it works forever is preposterous. And so, you believe those two things that this is where America needs to lead on electricity innovation and the future is heading towards a more distributed electricity system, and we have a big role to play in that. And so look, I think to Andy’s point, Andy Lubershane’s point that we talked about with the time for DERs is now, I think if you look at this from an investor perspective and you look at the metrics, and you look at the cost curves and all this type of stuff, there’s a pretty good argument to make.

I think the big question is like, are we ready for this? We as an industry. And Jigar and Katherine, and some of the other leaders in our field, 10 years ago they were ready for that and we were not. The rank and file soldiers of the distributed energy movement were not. And now I think we are. I think we’re battle hardened and we have experience, and we understand how this shit works and we’re ready to go. And so yeah, I’m going to bet on us. And I think what you’re going to see in 10 years is that we’re going to be closer to having the number one electricity system in the world than the number 19 electricity system in the world. And I think that’s the beginning, we can continue to grow this thing and improve, and ultimately set the standard. Now again, I think there’s definitely headwinds in our way, but ultimately I’m going to bet on innovation over everything. And so, that’s where I hope we get to.

Katherine Hamilton: I love that, Tim, and I would just say Jigar was talking about how the DER folks have been stuck in basements. And remember, my examples are from the ’80s, and when I say ’80s I mean 1980s where we kept our files in the back of a funeral home, and we are going now to literally in 10 years I look at organizations like Common Charge and others as really being pathways to break down and heal some of the divisions that we have in our country now. I feel like we all want the same things. We all want to be able to have electricity, we all want power all the time, and this can bring us together. I think DERs will be a means of doing so. It’s been heartbreaking to see how clean energy has become political, and I’m hopeful that some of what we’re working on on the distributed side will start healing that.

Jigar Shah: Look, I thought it was impossible for us to pass SB 540, SB 541 and SB 254 this year of the California legislature. It took 10 years to get those things passed, so we are now allowing California to trade with the rest of its neighbors, which really wasn’t allowed before. We are now mandating VPPs and DERs in the state, and the CEC is going to lead it, the CPC is going to follow. Thank God Alice is leaving, and so we’ll be in a good shape there. And 254 basically helps to securitize $6 billion worth of PG&E debt, which starts to bring costs down. My sense is that we’re going to pass legislation like this in another six states next year because of the political tailwinds we have, and my sense is the environmental groups are all going to get on board. And so, when you think about all of the momentum that we had in the early 2000s around renewable portfolio standards, and how much coordination it took to pass those, we will have the exact same level of coordination over the next 10 years to pass consumer bills of rights across the entire country.

And those Consumer Bill of Rights will include DERs at the very top, grid enhancing technologies, connect and manage, some of these other things that are 90% cheaper than what the utility’s preferred route to do things are. And that is what is going to make for, as Tim said, a century where America continues to have a world beating, a world leading electricity system, which I know that the people who work in the electricity system want. I mean, everybody that I know that works in the electric utility industry is proud of what they do every day, and I’m proud of them and all the great work that they do every day, and I’m proud to be part of that broader industry. And I do think we have what it takes, but I do think we’re going to have to pass laws in all 50 states to really give the consumer the bill of rights that they deserve to be able to be protected in this moment.

Stephen Lacey: A great place to close. What an extraordinary moment it is. Tim Hade is the co-founder of Brightfield Infrastructure, he’s the former CO and co-founder of Scale Microgrids. Tim, this was awesome.

“Colorado is proud to lead the nation in clean energy and consumers in our state continue to choose low cost renewable energy and clean, reliable technologies.","DENVER (KDVR) — Day two of the federal shutdown is winding down. While members of Congress are not set to vote on another proposal until Friday, President Donald Trump and his budget director are working on a plan to cut federal funding and jobs in blue states.

Colorado is set to see cuts.

The president’s budget director warned that since Wednesday, Colorado may lose some federal funding for clean energy programs. There is now a better idea of exactly what could be cut.

Coloradans push for enhanced premium tax credit extension amid government shutdown

Russell Vought is the U.S. Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He also helped write Project 2025. He met with President Trump on Thursday to determine which agencies he should cut.

The president said on social media that the two of them would determine if the cuts would be permanent or temporary; Trump called this an unprecedented opportunity. Vought said mass layoffs would likely happen Thursday or Friday, the president’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying thousands will likely be laid off from the federal workforce.

Vought also posted on X on Wednesday that nearly $8 billion in climate-related projects would be cancelled in 16 states, Colorado being the second on the list of all the states that went for Kamala Harris in 2024.

A list of the U.S. Department of Energy projects was shared with FOX31. There were 34 projects related to Colorado. While those projects did not have cost projections listed, they are believed to be worth more than $500 million in federal funding.

Among the institutions whose projects are facing cuts, Colorado State University, Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines and the Colorado Energy Office were all listed multiple times.

Groups, leaders react to Colorado’s expected funding cuts

The Colorado Energy Office sent FOX31 an updated statement Thursday afternoon, saying their grants impacted by the cuts total to $5 million.

“Colorado is proud to lead the nation in clean energy and consumers in our state continue to choose low cost renewable energy and clean, reliable technologies. We cannot allow China to surpass our country in these sectors. While we have not formally received any official federal notices of termination, we understand that two Colorado projects that total $5 million are on DOE’s list, which specifically targets states where a majority of Americans cast their votes in favor of the Democratic nominee for President. This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the Administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution, and create instability in our business community. The two Colorado Energy Office grants that are targeted on the list each provide $2.5 million to support reduced energy use and create cost savings through building energy codes and building performance standards that support decarbonization. These are just two of more than 30 grants totaling more than $500 million that are being illegally terminated in Colorado alone. Other terminated grants in Colorado range from oil and gas methane reduction projects and investments in grid resilience to support for utility programs in low-income communities.”

The Sierra Club:

“By cancelling more renewable energy projects, Donald Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans. These projects are stable, well-paying jobs, and crucial cost-savings for families. While families are already struggling with the high cost-of-living across the country, the administration is focused on playing political games and holding common sense projects hostage, leaving everyday Americans out to dry.”- Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp

Colorado’s congressional members:

“By cancelling more renewable energy projects, Donald Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans. These projects are stable, well-paying jobs, and crucial cost-savings for families. While families are already struggling with the high cost-of-living across the country, the administration is focused on playing political games and holding common sense projects hostage, leaving everyday Americans out to dry.” – Congressman Jason Crow, a Democrat representing Colorado’s 6th Congressional District

“The cancellation of this funding for political vengeance is blatantly illegal. Congress approved this funding to create jobs and to generate cleaner, cheaper power. Even if for some dark reason you are against cleaner energy, these projects are well underway. To abandon them now wastes the funds already invested, and needlessly cripples dozens of honest, hard-working small businesses that believed having a legal contract with our country meant something. The White House strategy during their shutdown is to punish Americans who dared to vote against them.”- Senator John Hickenlooper, a Democrat

FOX31 is still working to learn exactly which projects could be affected and how much funding they could lose. Decarbonization could be a central goal of many of the projects on the chopping block.

“Since then, national sales data have shown a noticeable uptick as consumers rush to purchase EVs while the credit is still available,” the report states.
The internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle market share declined 4.2 percentage points.
Hybrid EV market share increased by 4.7 percentage points, while ICE vehicle market share contracted by 4.2 percentage points, the report says.
Through Q2 2025, the number of publicly available EV chargers increased 12% from 2024, while total EVs on the road also increased 12%.","As of Q2 2025, there were 6.5 million electric vehicles (EVs) on U.S. roads, or 2.25% of vehicles in operation, which is a new high, and a total of 217,929 public charging outlets — a ratio of 30 EVs for every public port, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation’s “Get Connected Electric Vehicle Report Q2 2025.”

EVs represented 9.5% of new light-duty vehicle sales in the quarter, down by 9,000 units from 9.6% in Q1, and from 10.9% in Q4 2024.

The report summarizes EV sales and purchasing trends across all 50 states, breaking down light-duty market share by powertrain (2016-2025) in addition to a geographic distribution analysis of registered EVs, state-by-state charging infrastructure, and a look at EV battery recycling.

The report notes that federal EV policies have shifted since 2024, including the elimination of consumer EV tax credits after Sept. 30, 2025. The report is based on data trends that occurred just before the tax incentive elimination was signed into law at the beginning of Q3.

“Since then, national sales data have shown a noticeable uptick as consumers rush to purchase EVs while the credit is still available,” the report states. “Nevertheless, EVs remain an important part of the U.S. market, both in response to consumer demand and in the larger picture of U.S. global competitiveness.”

EV market share declined by 0.5 percentage points from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025; however, EV volume increased by 4%, or 29,000 units.

The internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle market share declined 4.2 percentage points.

According to the report, as of Q2, 155 EV, utility vehicle, pickup truck, and van models were sold in the U.S.:

Ninety-five battery electric vehicles — 26 cars, 52 utility vehicles, seven pickups, and 10 vans

Fifty-seven plug-in hybrid vehicles — 24 cars, 32 utility vehicles, and one van

Three fuel cell electric vehicles (including a plug-in hybrid fuel cell) — one car and two utility vehicles

Light truck sales represented 79% of the Q2 EV market, unchanged from Q1 2025. California (22.9%) and Colorado (20.5%) led the country for EV registrations.

Nine states and the District of Columbia had EV registrations above 10% in Q2 2025:

District of Columbia (17.4%)

Washington (16.9%)

Nevada (16.2%)

Oregon (13.8%)

New Jersey (12.8%)

Florida (10.5%)

Hawaii (10.2%)

Connecticut (10.1%)

Massachusetts (10.1%)

Michigan (10.1%)

U.S. EV registrations stood at 385,075 in Q2 — a 0.3% volume decrease, or about 2,000 units, compared to Q2 2024.

Year-over-year, total light-duty sales (all powertrains) increased 5%, or about 194,000 units. Hybrid EV market share increased by 4.7 percentage points, while ICE vehicle market share contracted by 4.2 percentage points, the report says.

Nearly 761,000 EVs were sold in the first half of 2025, making up 9.55% of all light vehicle sales, and a decreased market share of 0.1 percentage point from the first half of 2024.

Through Q2 2025, the number of publicly available EV chargers increased 12% from 2024, while total EVs on the road also increased 12%.

During the quarter, 9,424 new public chargers were added — a ratio of 41 new EVs for every new public port, the report says.

More than 1 million additional public chargers (906,670 L2 and 124,401 DC Fast) are required to meet the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s necessary infrastructure estimate for 2030, according to the report. That breaks down to 513 chargers installed per day, or nearly 3.6 chargers every 10 minutes, through the end of 2030.

“A circular economy for EV batteries — focused on recycling, reusing, and repurposing — offers a path to strengthen supply chains, improve affordability, and ensure sustainable growth,” the report states. “More than 80% of global recycling capacity is in China, compared with less than 2% in the U.S.”

China is forecast to account for 78% of battery pretreatment capacity and 89% of black mass refining capacity, as the demand for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite is projected to continue surging, according to the report.

In the next decade, it’s projected that more than 100 million vehicle batteries will reach end-of-life, which the report says will create “a massive pool of recoverable material.”

“Recycling and reuse could cut primary mineral demand by 12% by 2040,” the report states. “By 2040, recovered materials could supply more than half of the global demand for these critical minerals.”

Cost savings are estimated to reach as much as $25 billion annually.

Wikipedia: Carbon offsets and credits

Research from The Australia Institute has suggested that at least 25% of carbon offsets may lack integrity, describing them as ""hot air.""[129][130] Additionally, some reports have raised concerns that carbon offsets could be used to justify the continuation or expansion of fossil fuel projects, potentially delaying direct efforts to reduce emissions.[131]

Using projects in this way is called ""greenwashing"".[132] Pope Francis noted in his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato si' the risk that countries and sectors may use carbon credits as ""a ploy which permits maintaining [their] excessive consumption"".[133]

Many projects that give credits for carbon sequestration have received criticism as greenwashing because they overstated their ability to sequester carbon, with some projects being shown to actually increase overall emissions.[19][20][21][22]

In 2023, a civil suit was brought against Delta Air Lines based on its use of carbon credits to support claims of carbon neutrality.[134] In 2016 the Öko-Institut analyzed a series of CDM projects. It found that 85% had a low likelihood of being truly additional or were likely to over-estimate emission reductions.[135] In 2023, the University of California all but dropped the purchase of offsets in favor of direct reductions in emissions.[136]

Add in the Honda/Acura EVs, and GM’s Ultium platform is at ~193,000 units on the year.

Need to see how much things fall off in Q4, but 175,000 for GM EVs and 230,000 for Ultium in 2025 seem like good targets.

Similarly, there are existing and predicted shortages of healthcare providers who offer SUD treatment, further limiting treatment capacity.
The reauthorized SUPPORT Act attempts to ease some of these challenges while providing much-needed investment in our prevention, treatment, and harm reduction infrastructure.
More Work to Do The passage of the SUPPORT Act reauthorization is good news, but more action is needed to address SUD and overdose deaths.
One important piece of legislation to expand access to evidence-based treatment has stalled in Congress: the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA-A).","On Sept. 18, 2025, something good happened: The Senate unanimously passed legislation to direct significant funds toward combating the opioid crisis. More accurately, no one objected when Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) asked for unanimous consent to pass the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025 (i.e., the SUPPORT Act), which the House passed in June. The SUPPORT Act’s passage is surprising since it languished in legislative limbo for two years after the original version expired.

The Substance-Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 was, at the time, the largest congressional investment in overdose prevention ever made. Many of its provisions were limited to five years, expiring at the end of September 2023. Upon that expiration, Congress modified or continued many of the act’s elements via other legislation. These stopgap measures were important, but a full reauthorization gives communities and providers support they can rely on. It also reminds us that bipartisan cooperation—including on evidence-based harm reduction approaches like overdose reversal medications—is still achievable.

A Step in the Right Direction

Many states have too few treatment facilities, making it unsurprising that only 6.3 percent of people in the United States who have substance use disorder (SUD) receive treatment each year. Similarly, there are existing and predicted shortages of healthcare providers who offer SUD treatment, further limiting treatment capacity.

The reauthorized SUPPORT Act attempts to ease some of these challenges while providing much-needed investment in our prevention, treatment, and harm reduction infrastructure. It attempts to expand treatment capacity by investing in programs that support SUD treatment providers, such as educational loan assistance and professional development, and exploring less restrictive regulation of Suboxone, a medication for opioid use disorder that contains buprenorphine and naloxone. Funding for different treatment options, including comprehensive opioid recovery centers, community-based programs, and programs led by people in recovery, is included in the reauthorization. The act also addresses SUD more broadly, allocating funding to programs that support youth prevention and recovery, treatment during and after pregnancy, career support for people in recovery, expanded access to the overdose reversal medication naloxone, overdose reversal training for first responders, and infectious disease monitoring related to injection drug use.

More Work to Do

The passage of the SUPPORT Act reauthorization is good news, but more action is needed to address SUD and overdose deaths. Congress should continue to remove obstacles to a range of intertwined harm reduction and treatment options. Improving access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is particularly important. It’s also important that treatment options be evidence-based, diverse, and able to meet different needs rather than forcing people into a single type of treatment. (We looked at some limitations of current treatment options in a recent Safer Solutions post).

One important piece of legislation to expand access to evidence-based treatment has stalled in Congress: the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA-A). Introduced in 2023, MOTA-A would expand access to methadone—a “gold standard” treatment for people with OUD. Currently, patients can only access methadone through specialized clinics known as opioid treatment programs (OTPs). This system presents a number of barriers for patients, including limited geographic access and restrictive hours and policies. MOTA-A would increase the number of access points to methadone by allowing addiction specialist physicians to prescribe it and pharmacies to dispense it—independent of the OTP system.

Congress can also remove barriers via the Temporary Emergency Scheduling and Testing of Fentanyl Analogues Act of 2023, the Telehealth Response for E-prescribing Addiction Therapy Services Act, and the Reentry Act and Due Process Continuity of Care Act. Respectively, these bills would empower scientists to conduct research on the substances in our drug supply, make SUD treatment more accessible (especially for people in rural areas), and boost uninterrupted access to treatment for people re-entering society from incarceration.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AdobeStock_61493778-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 07:59:55.166825

Government Shutdown Outlook: On Sept. 29, House and Senate majority and minority leaders, also known as the “Big 4,” met with President Trump to discuss the imminent federal government shutdown. The meeting ended without an agreement, leaving the government on track to shut down on Tuesday at midnight for the first time in over five years. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) pressed for a broader deal that includes extending the enhanced Advance Premium Tax Credits (eAPTCs), reversing health care cuts from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, P.L. 119-21) and limiting the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) ability to rescind congressional funding unilaterally. Minority Leaders Schumer and Jeffries said President Trump appeared open to bipartisan talks on some issues but agreed with Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who pushed for a “clean” stopgap funding bill that would fund the government through Nov. 21 and provide time for potential negotiations along with a final appropriations deal for FY 2026. Behind the scenes, Minority Leader Schumer reportedly considered a short-term extension as a possible compromise but publicly insisted on immediate action to avoid the shutdown.

On the agency side, the Treasury Department released its contingency plan for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and departmental offices in case a deal is not reached. Due to supplemental funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169) available through 2031, the IRS will be able to maintain operations for five business days under the contingency plan. The contingency plan also notes that all employees are funded by these multiyear appropriations and therefore are exempt from furlough, remaining on duty during the shutdown. The plan outlines that, if needed, shutdown activities would take no more than half a day to implement. It also emphasizes that operations (i.e., taxpayer services), enforcement and IT will remain fully staffed and funded.

Additionally, a shutdown is not expected to affect the work of the Office of Tax Policy (OTP) and IRS Chief Counsel significantly with respect to implementation of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), although external engagement with stakeholders may pause until funding resumes.

Earlier this month, OMB issued a memo instructing federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs if a government shutdown occurs. The memo contemplates that agencies may issue Reduction in Force (RIF) notices for employees working on programs whose funding would lapse, considering long-term workforce reductions aligned with administration priorities. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provided guidance emphasizing that layoffs could be revised once funding is restored and that employees may receive 60 days’ notice before any separation takes effect.

Energy-Tax Mainlines

Electric Vehicle Tax Credit Comes to an End: As of Oct. 1, consumers can no longer claim federal tax credits for new, previously owned or qualified commercial clean vehicles. The OBBBA’s enactment in July accelerated the phaseout and termination of several clean energy incentives, including sections 25E, 30D and 45W. Taxpayers who entered into a binding contract and made payment before the Sept. 30 deadline may still claim the credit once the vehicle is placed in service. The next clean vehicle incentive scheduled to expire is the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property tax credit, which will end on June 30, 2026.

Investment Strategies Shift Toward Clean Energy Projects Qualifying Under Expired Tax Credits: To avoid uncertainty in investment strategies, some investors are directing more capital toward clean energy projects that began construction before the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired at the end of 2024. Banks and corporations are classifying Section 48-eligible projects as lower risk because they are shielded from the added uncertainties of the Section 48E Clean Electricity ITC under the OBBBA. At an industry conference, tax credit investment leaders noted that developers who started projects earlier are now prioritized by investors, with institutions focusing exclusively on Section 48 credit opportunities in the near term.

1111 Constitution Avenue

Treasury Department/IRS Issue 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan: On Oct. 1, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan (PGP) that addresses the tax guidance priorities for the next year. The plan identifies 105 guidance projects that the Treasury Department and IRS will prioritize from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, focusing on implementing the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), deregulation and burden reduction, tribal tax issues, digital assets and the SECURE 2.0 Act.

Key upcoming OBBBA regulations in the plan include guidance on deductions for overtime pay, car loan interest and qualified business income, along with permanent expansions of the standard and child tax deductions. The plan also addresses energy tax credits, noting the accelerated phaseout of several clean energy credits after 2025, including the Residential Clean Energy Credit and Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, with deadlines for wind and solar projects extending through 2027. The Clean Fuel Production Credit is extended through 2029 but with more stringent domestic content and ownership requirements, while electric vehicle credits face earlier phaseouts. The PGP also continues to anticipate guidance on the section 45U production credit for existing nuclear facilities.

IRS Issues Proposed Rulemaking for Tipped Income Deduction: On Sept. 22, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued proposed regulations for the “No Tax on Tips” provision enacted under the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The provision allows workers in occupations that customarily and regularly received tips to deduct up to $25,000 in qualified tips per year from their income beginning in 2025 through 2028. The deduction is available to both employees and self-employed individuals, regardless of whether they itemize deductions, but phases out for taxpayers earning above $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). “Qualified tips” are defined as voluntary, customer-paid cash or charged tips, but exclude mandatory service charges like auto-gratuities and certain service business categories.

Some of the occupations eligible for the tip deduction include:

Hospitality: housekeeper, bellhop, concierge, hotel desk clerk, valet

Food Service: waiter/waitress, bartender, host, busser, chef, cook, baker, dishwasher, fast food worker

Entertainment & Events: casino dealer, gambling attendant, dancer, musician, DJ, performer, usher, ticket taker, coat/lobby attendant

Personal Appearance & Wellness: hairdresser, barber, nail technician, massage therapist, spa attendant, tattoo artist, fitness instructor, yoga instructor

Transportation & Delivery: taxi driver, rideshare driver, valet attendant, tow truck driver, pizza/grocery/delivery driver, parking garage attendant

Home Services: house cleaner, gardener, landscaper, handyman, plumber, electrician, appliance installer/repairer, locksmith, road assistance worker

Recreation & Leisure: ski instructor, skydiving pilot, golf caddy, recreation guide

Digital Content & Media: online video creator, podcaster, content creator

The proposed rule also provides examples and reporting requirements. The public-comment period is open until Oct. 22, 2025. A public hearing is scheduled for Oct. 23, 2025.

Treasury Department Releases Interim Guidance on CAMT: The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued two new pieces of interim guidance, Notices 2025-46 and 2025-49, addressing the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Notice 2025-46 provides rules for domestic corporate transactions, financially troubled companies and consolidated groups, clarifying how AFSI and CAMT basis should be determined. Notice 2025-49 expands taxpayer flexibility, overhauls reliance rules and introduces targeted AFSI adjustments covering fair value items, utilities, tonnage tax, insurance company NOLs and goodwill amortization.

IRS Workforce Reductions Affecting OBBBA Implementation: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Office of Chief Counsel is facing significant staffing shortages after more than 350 attorneys resigned from the office. The departures have left leadership gaps across several divisions as the agency works towards implementing the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). With limited resources, the office is prioritizing guidance on notable provisions such as tip income and overtime deductions and R&D expenses, while other projects may be delayed or dropped. The division also plays a key role in litigation and the administration’s deregulatory push will most likely see delays as new hires join. While core deadlines are expected to be met, competing legacy priorities from previous laws, like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the government shutdown will complicate an already strained rollout.

IRS to Begin Transitions to Paper Checks: In accordance with the President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) from March titled “Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account,” the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will begin to phase out tax refunds on paper checks starting on Sept. 30. While most taxpayers already receive refunds via direct deposit, around 7% still get paper checks. The IRS plans to provide detailed guidance for filing 2025 taxes before the 2026 filing season begins and will continue to accept paper checks from taxpayers until then. The IRS encouraged taxpayers without bank accounts to consider opening one or using prepaid debit cards or digital wallets, with some exceptions available for those who lack access to electronic payment systems.

In response to the IRS announcement about the transition, Sens. Angus King (I-ME), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in addition to Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Chellie Pingree (D-ME) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought urging a delay in implementing the EO. They argue that the accelerated timeline risks harming older and disabled Americans, veterans, small-business owners, farmers, rural and tribal communities and the domestic forest products industry, which relies heavily on demand for paper. They also emphasize that millions remain without bank accounts or lack reliable broadband, making electronic payments inaccessible. The lawmakers called for extending the timeline, enhancing outreach efforts, ensuring waivers are available and requesting detailed information on waiver processes, stakeholder engagement, fraud protections and interagency coordination.

IRS Extends Third Deferred Resignation Offer to Employees: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has extended a deferred resignation offer to select employees currently on administrative leave, allowing them to remain on paid leave until they permanently leave the agency on Dec. 31. This is the third instance in which the IRS has extended the offer and the number of employees offered or who have accepted this most recent offer has not been disclosed. Earlier in the year, about 21,000 IRS employees accepted similar deferred resignation offers. The agency has also placed employees on administrative leave in waves, including senior leadership and IT staff. After a significant number accepted the offers and left over the summer, the IRS has begun hiring again and has invited some employees who previously had intentions to leave to return.

Tax Worldview

U.S. Companies Highlight Importance for the OECD Tax Agreement: In the past few weeks, U.S. multinational companies have expressed concerns to Congress and the Trump administration that the pace of negotiations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to revise the global minimum tax framework, known as Pillar Two, is moving too slowly. Without a timely agreement, including provisions allowing for a “side-by-side” exception for the U.S. international tax system, these companies argue that the 15% global minimum tax will impose significant compliance costs. The side-by-side approach was part of a deal reached in June between the United States and the G-7 countries, leading to the removal of the proposed Section 899 “revenge tax” from the OBBBA.

U.S. business groups have also raised concerns with the Treasury Department regarding Australia’s new Pillar Two country-by-country reporting requirement and the Australian government’s intention to release such reports to the public. Concerns have been raised that the disclosures will affect privately held companies and information about U.S.-parented multinational groups, rather than just Australian subsidiaries.

Relatedly, as negotiations continue to stall, some countries like Kenya, France and Spain have implemented or maintained digital services taxes (DSTs) on technology companies as temporary measures, while others, such as India and Canada, have repealed their DSTs following pressure from the Trump administration.

Treasury Department, IRS to Release International Tax Guidance by Year-End: At an event last week, Huzefa Mun, a Treasury Department attorney, said four pieces of guidance addressing near-term international tax provisions from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) are expected to be released by year-end. Priority areas include changes to the foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI) rules under Section 250, revisions to the elimination of the one-month deferral rule for controlled foreign corporations under Section 898(c) and guidance on the changes to Sections 951 and 960(b) relating to transition rules and foreign-earned income credits. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are also weighing how stewardship expenses should be allocated under the revamped Net CFC Tested Income (NCTI) regime (the successor to GILTI), while broader changes under the law will be taken up in 2026 through proposed rulemakings.

At A Glance

CAMT Reemerges in Corporate Tax Planning Strategies: The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) made several provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA, P.L. 115-97) permanent, including immediate deductibility of research and development expenditures. However, the restored R&D benefit may now conflict with the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for some companies, as unamortized deductions from 2022 through 2024 trigger CAMT liability. Energy and technology firms warn they could lose access to hundreds of millions of dollars in credits, while business groups argue the restriction weakens incentives for domestic R&D. Business groups are urging Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration to pursue fixes through legislation or Treasury Department guidance.

Warren Presses JCT on Bonus Depreciation Under OBBBA: On Sept. 29, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent a letter to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) expressing concern about the permanent extension of 100% bonus depreciation enacted in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which is estimated to cost $362.7 billion over 10 years. She highlighted that the provision primarily benefits large corporations and contends that the provision will result in little economic stimulus. Sen. Warren asked JCT to provide information on which industries and companies benefited most from bonus depreciation between 2018 and 2022, how it may affect tax liabilities in 2025 and 2026, the types of assets written off and the effects of the provision’s retroactive application.

The building is a symbol of what private-sector leadership can achieve, but Farley says Ford cannot turn the essential economy around alone.
Dimon advised Ford to “take the lead,” but to enlist support from other companies, NGOs, family offices, and state and local policymakers.
But he believes that Silicon Valley’s large language model-makers have drifted too far from companies like Ford, and from its essential economy customers.
Strengthening Ford’s position in the highly profitable truck and van division that sells to the essential economy is central to Farley’s strategy.","Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley stood in front of a crowd in Detroit this week and said that if Henry Ford were alive today, “he’d be really upset at all of us.” His audience included US Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and CEOs from AT&T’s John Stankey to TIAA’s Thasunda Brown Duckett. His message was that the US has let its “essential economy” fall into crisis.

Farley, whose grandfather helped build Henry Ford’s Model T cars, defines the essential economy as “everything we build, move, and fix.” That includes the 95 million workers and 3 million small businesses that depend on trucks, vans, and other commercial vehicles, like those made by his Ford Pro division. Critical industries from construction to transportation, which drive $12 trillion of GDP, are suffering from worsening staffing shortages, maddening bureaucracy, and sliding productivity, he warns. “It’s a huge crisis, and it’s not getting better, it’s getting worse.”

In an interview conducted via video call from the passenger seat of a new Lincoln Navigator, Farley says three things came together to spark his alarm. Ford dealerships have a 6,000-person shortage of technicians; entry-level Ford workers have told Farley that they need to work multiple jobs to make ends meet; and he has observed a widening gulf between Ford Pro’s struggling customers and tech evangelists who say AI will transform society.

“If you listen to technology companies, the answer is, just buy more AI products from them and we’ll be fine,” he says. But as he learned more about the difficulties facing Ford’s commercial customers, “I just realized, oh my God, we are in deep trouble here.”

The promise and limits of private-sector leadership

Ford billed this week’s gathering in Detroit as the first national conversation on the essential economy, but Farley says he’s tired of talk. “I’m not really interested in observing or admiring the problem anymore,” he explains, noting that Ford structured its event around a series of solution-seeking workshops. “If we can walk away with two or three really meaty actions for the three main problems — productivity, [worker] shortages, [and the] regulatory environment — then I’ll be happy with that outcome.”

Farley argues that America must reform the bureaucracy that slows down permitting, invest in apprenticeships and trade schools, and make AI “supercharge” the productivity of front-line workers, rather than replace them.

He delivered his pitch in the once-derelict Michigan Central Station, which Ford bought in 2018 and reopened last year as the centerpiece of a new innovation district. The building is a symbol of what private-sector leadership can achieve, but Farley says Ford cannot turn the essential economy around alone.

The planning for what he hopes will be the first of many Ford Pro Accelerate events began early this year, after he consulted JPMorgan Chase Chief Jamie Dimon about how to drive action on the kind of problems that one company cannot solve by itself. Dimon advised Ford to “take the lead,” but to enlist support from other companies, NGOs, family offices, and state and local policymakers.

The blind spots of breakthrough technologies

Like most of his peers, Farley sees AI’s potential for everything from improving warranty processes to training novice technicians to repair complex engines. But he believes that Silicon Valley’s large language model-makers have drifted too far from companies like Ford, and from its essential economy customers. “So far, [they] basically come to us and say, ‘here’s my solution, buy this to make your engineers more productive,’” he says. “The technologists have yet to fashion their technology towards this part of the economy… Their go-to methodology is, ‘Let’s fix big problems that we can sell to big companies or big institutions.’ They don’t like these dirty problems that are complicated.”

Farley sees an irony in this disconnect: “They’re building all these data centers that require essential economy people, and then they complain, ‘Well, I can’t find [people], my construction is behind time, it’s costing too much.’ It’s like, ‘Well, why are you complaining about the very thing that you could help solve?’”

His concern is shared by other industrial executives, such as Barbara Humpton, the former head of Siemens USA, who this week moved to run USA Rare Earth, a rare earth materials and magnets supplier. Humpton told Semafor she sees huge opportunities for “industrial AI,” but when Silicon Valley talks of transforming manufacturing, she asks: “Have you done any manufacturing?”

For Farley, that disconnect speaks to a growing cultural divide in how Americans view essential economy careers. “Our society does not honor these vocations like when our grandparents did these jobs,” he says. “I mean, how many times have you and I seen politicians run to shake hands with a union member on the [shop] floor? But they’re doing it to connect as voters. They’re not connecting with them as humans and thinking about how to serve them as policy leaders.”

Both President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, pushed to bring more manufacturing to US shores, Farley notes. “For the first time, we started to get industrial policy in the US, and yet, they hadn’t thought through this piece of it.”

Chaos and progress as government takes the wheel

Farley is one of the few US CEOs to have expressed frustration with Trump’s trade agenda publicly, saying in February that the president’s tariffs had created “a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,” and estimating more recently that they may cost Ford $2 billion.

“I’d say we’ve made some progress on the policy side,” he says now. “But there’s more work to be done — a lot more work to be done.”

Bilateral trade agreements with South Korea, Japan, and the UK have brought some clarity, he says now, and a rollback of tailpipe emissions regulations will offset some of the tariff costs. But he sounds resigned to the prospect of US policy changing sharply after every election.

“What we’ve learned at Ford after 120 years and certainly now, is we have to have our own plan,” he says. On issues like CO2 emissions, “We’re not going to rely wholly on administration policy. We have to make our own judgment as a company, and I think that’s been a bit of an awakening for us.”

On stage in Detroit this week, Farley spelled out the stark potential impact of Trump’s reversal of one of his predecessor’s policies. The Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicles could cut EV sales in the US in half next month, he said, to just 5% of the US vehicle market. “It’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.”

Staying alert after a wake-up call

This week also marked Farley’s fifth anniversary as CEO. Asked what the milestone meant to him, he replied: “To be honest, not much… I think we’ve built a solid foundation at Ford, but to build that North Star company, we have a lot of work to do.”

Ford’s annual revenues have grown from $127 billion to $185 billion over Farley’s tenure. But its stock’s advance has lagged that of rival GM as costly recalls to fix quality defects have detracted from Farley’s strategic refocusing and efforts to improve profit margins. Strengthening Ford’s position in the highly profitable truck and van division that sells to the essential economy is central to Farley’s strategy.

So, too, is finding the right response to Americans’ sputtering adoption of electric vehicles, and a path to profitability for Ford Model e, the group’s loss-making EV division.

After a chastening trip to China, Farley declared that the advanced, low-cost electric vehicles being produced by Chinese automakers like BYD posed “an existential threat” to Ford. He responded by shipping some of his rivals’ models to Michigan for his engineers to pull apart and learn from.

At the same time, he revealed that he had formed a secret “skunkworks” program two years earlier, led by Apple and Tesla veteran Doug Field, to develop EVs affordable enough to compete.

“I looked my team in the eye and I said, ‘Can you match BYD’s IT?’ They said, ‘Maybe.’ And I said, ‘No, I don’t think you can,’” Farley explains. Ford’s computer-aided design system was 20 years old, and the company lacked the specialized talent he needed, he says. “I can’t just take [internal combustion engine] people and throw them in an EV and say, ‘Make me a world-class battery.’”

Farley thinks the gap between US and Chinese carmakers has continued to widen, as Beijing underwrites loss-making automakers at a level that Washington is not willing to do.

The Ford Universal EV Platform, a new manufacturing process that he dubbed a “Model T moment” for EVs when he unveiled it last month, gives him confidence that Ford is “pretty ready” for the competition. But, he cautions, “the standard changes every month, so we could feel comfortable where we’re going to be in a year, but in three years, are we going to be fully competitive with BYD in Mexico? That’s a whole different question.”

Farley acknowledges the challenge of integrating the two cultures — his stealthy high-tech team, and the manufacturers who’ve been mass-producing vehicles for decades “Actually executing at scale, this maverick team has never done that, so now that’s what we’re doing. We’re a year and a half away from launch, and now this stuff’s going to get real.”

Once again, Farley is wary of letting complacency creep in. “I have no idea what’s going to happen,” he admits. “Everyone in this world wants the CEO to say, ‘Everything will be fine.’ [But] we’ve never built a car like this... There are no guarantees this is going to go just perfectly. So I think it will be an interesting conversation a year and a half from now. But we have no choice. We have to do this.”","https://img.semafor.com/1cfc8f2f20fe731759ca33d03b85c8d04b83ecc7-3000x2287.png?rect=0,357,3000,1575&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-10-03 10:01:35.515311

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

The proposal envisions roles in construction, infrastructure development, grid upgrades, engineering, and manufacturing of green technologies. By tying job creation to clean energy expansion, the strategy aims to generate momentum in regional economies across the country and draw in new investment into low-carbon industries.

Beyond sheer numbers, the proposals also emphasize quality and fairness. The plan includes a Fair Work Charter designed to ensure decent pay, secure conditions, rights at work, and protections against exploitative practices. In particular, attention is being paid to closing loopholes that currently allow certain roles in the energy transition to undercut standards. The vision is of a clean energy economy where growth does not come at the cost of workers’ security or dignity.

The announcement further nominates priority occupations, such as engineers, welders, electricians, and construction trades, for rapid expansion, backed by training incentives and funding for skills development. The goal is not simply to create roles but to make these careers sustainable and attractive long term. Regions that host industrial infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities are expected to see direct gains, with the potential for supply chains and local service industries to grow in support.

Critically, the government plans to integrate this jobs agenda into a broader industrial and climate policy framework. The narrative positions clean energy not as a niche or side project, but as a foundation of future economic resilience. By backing smart infrastructure, renewable generation, and modernisation of networks, the plan seeks to align labour market growth with decarbonisation goals. Communities across the country are being offered a chance to take part in the energy transition, both as places of production and as beneficiaries of improved connectivity, clean air, and economic opportunity.

The proposal is being cast as a turning point: an opportunity to redefine how energy, jobs, and climate goals intersect. It sends a signal that the next wave of industrial growth will be green, and that the prosperity of tomorrow depends on building a workforce equipped for the clean energy era.

For Tesla (TSLA), it's customers rushing to purchase vehicles just before the expiration of crucial tax credits. The electric auto company reported surprisingly strong third quarter global deliveries Thursday as the sunset of the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US appeared to reverse what had been a sales decline.

The sunny report served as a stark reminder that Tesla, and other EV makers, face a harsher market ahead without the draw and cushion of government subsidies. Because it wasn't just Tesla that enjoyed a last-minute feast of sales.

The rush to cash in on tax breaks before their end comes at a moment of uncertainty for Tesla. A challenging first half of the year, tied in part to the public backlash against CEO Elon Musk, has weighed on the company, just as it works to redefine itself as an AI and robotics giant.

That helps explain why the stock fell even after beating Wall Street delivery estimates, but remains near all-time highs.

If the criticism against Tesla — the stock — is that it is divorced from the actual business of selling cars, then the response from its leadership and faithful backers is that Tesla isn't a car company, and shouldn't trade like one.

Investors are eyeing production plans for the Cybercab, Tesla's dedicated autonomous vehicle at the heart of its robotaxi service. The company plans to start churning them out as soon as next year. And the bulls hope it's a paradigm shift.

""The AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for TSLA over the next six to nine months has now begun,"" Wedbush analyst and vocal Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note to clients on Thursday.

But what's most striking about Tesla's bull case is that even as the company says farewell to special tax breaks, its most optimistic forecasts rely on — and perhaps even take for granted — another kind of government assistance elevating the company to multitrillion-dollar heights.

Ives said he expects the Trump White House to fast-track Tesla's autonomous initiatives. As Washington battles Beijing in an AI arms race, companies like Tesla serve a useful purpose to the US government, the thinking goes. American AI leadership aligns the goals of the administration with those of Musk and his investors.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has made a similar geopolitical argument for why it's important for his company to compete in China. And other Silicon Valley heavyweights have cautioned that aggressively regulating tech companies would give a leg up to unburdened Chinese firms.

Back to the reality of Tesla's car sales, where most of the company's business comes from: The news was good, at least for the moment. But on a broader scale, the end of a special benefit doesn't seem to matter when another, even bigger one is on its way.

The two companies have entered into a new Engineering Services Agreement (ESA), marking the next stage of collaboration on what will be the nation’s first transmission line to directly connect three major energy markets.

The 420-mile North Plains Connector will operate as a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system running at ±525 kilovolts. Once complete, it will be capable of carrying up to 3,000 megawatts of electricity in either direction. Enough to power millions of homes and businesses. By linking Montana and North Dakota to the wider grid, the project will support the growing energy needs of AI data centers, industrial electrification, and communities across the country.

The New Engineering Services Agreement (ESA)

Under the ESA, Hitachi Energy will provide early-stage engineering work, including the design of converter station specifications. This step is intended to reduce project risk, strengthen supply chain planning, and speed up overall execution. The agreement builds on the companies’ earlier collaboration announced in March 2024 and underscores their shared commitment to advancing HVDC technology in the U.S.

“Allie Wahrenberger, Vice President of Engineering for Grid United, said the project represents a milestone for the U.S. transmission system. ‘North Plains Connector will be the first transmission system connecting three major U.S. energy markets. Supporting a key Department of Energy goal of enhancing grid reliability and resilience. We are excited to move forward with world-class engineering from Hitachi Energy,’ she noted.”

Connecting Eastern and Western U.S. Grids

The project will integrate the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). By improving grid coordination across these organizations, the North Plains Connector is expected to unlock new capacity, reduce bottlenecks, and strengthen overall reliability. Local communities in Montana and North Dakota are also projected to benefit from job creation and increased tax revenue once construction begins.

Hitachi Energy executives emphasized that the partnership illustrates how early collaboration can help streamline complex projects. “This new agreement with Grid United is a perfect example of how a long-term collaboration built on trust and a shared vision can accelerate delivery and mitigate risk,” said Nathanael Occenad, Vice President and Regional HVDC Sales Manager for Hitachi Energy in the Americas.

Long-distance transmission lines like the North Plains Connector are increasingly critical as the U.S. works to balance abundant low-cost power generation with surging electricity demand. Beyond its regional benefits, the project is aligned with broader national energy strategies, including the White House AI Action Plan, which prioritizes a stronger grid to secure U.S. competitiveness in artificial intelligence and advanced technologies.

Alongside the North Plains Connector, Hitachi Energy is actively advancing other major U.S. initiatives, including a $457 million power transformer manufacturing plant in South Boston, Virginia. The largest such investment in Southside Virginia, set to establish the region as a hub for high-tech electrical infrastructure.

The cancellations affect places like Colorado State University, the Colorado School of Mines and the Colorado Energy Office, among others, whose grants have been marked for termination.

Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, announced on Wednesday that funds would be canceled for 223 projects across 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

According to a list by House Appropriations Committee Democrats, 34 projects in Colorado are on the chopping block.

The cancellations affect places like Colorado State University, the Colorado School of Mines and the Colorado Energy Office, among others, whose grants have been marked for termination.

""Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,"" the Energy Department wrote.

Denver7 political analyst Alton Dillard said the cuts send a clear political message.

""One, it is always going to be concerning that having a clean climate is somehow become politicized,"" said Dillard. ""But it also is sending the message that if you are in a state that supported Harris, that you're going to pay.""

Dillard warned of significant consequences for Colorado's energy sector.

""In a state like Colorado that's known for innovation and entrepreneurship, the downstream effects, I think, are going to be dire,"" he explained. ""So you add this back in again to the fact that we're also in the middle of a government shutdown, and I know it's an overused term, but we are at a major inflection point in not only clean energy, but just government in general.""

Dillard added that no one should be surprised by this move, as it delivers on exactly what the Trump administration said it was going to do.

The cancellations are likely to face legal challenges. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, recipients of those awards will have 30 days to appeal the department's decision.

Reaction from Colorado's lawmakers

“I’ve always been in energy because I think it’s just far and away the world’s most important industry,” Wright said at the forum, which included a panel discussion with business leaders and a fireside chat with MIT Professor Ernest Moniz, who was the U.S. secretary of energy from 2013 to 2017. Wright added: “Not only is it by far the world’s most important industry, because it enables all the others, but it’s also a booming time right now. … It is an awesomely exciting time to be in energy.”

Wright was greeted on campus by MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who also gave introductory remarks at the forum, held in MIT’s Samberg Center. While the Institute has added many research facilities and buildings since Wright was a student, Kornbluth observed, the core MIT ethos remains the same.

“MIT is still MIT,” Kornbluth said. “It’s a community that rewards merit, boldness, and scientific rigor. And it’s a magnet for people with a drive to solve hard problems that matter in the real world, an enthusiasm for working with industry, and an ethic of national service.”

When it comes to energy research, Kornbluth added, “MIT is developing transformational approaches to make American energy more secure, reliable, affordable, and clean — which in turn will strengthen both U.S. competitiveness and national security.”

At the event, Wright, the 17th U.S. secretary of energy, engaged in a fireside chat with Moniz, the 13th U.S. secretary of energy, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems Post-Tenure, a special advisor to the MIT president, and the founding director of the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI). Wright began his remarks by reflecting on Kornbluth’s description of the Institute.

“Merit, boldness, and scientific rigor,” Wright said. “That is MIT … to me. That hit me hard when I got here, and frankly, it’s a good part of the reason my life has gone the way it’s gone.”

On energy topics, Wright emphasized the need for continued innovation in energy across a range of technologies, including fusion, geothermal, and more, while advocating for the benefits of vigorous market-based progress. Before becoming secretary of energy, Wright most recently served as founder and CEO of Liberty Energy. He also was the founder of Pinnacle Technologies, among other enterprises. Wright was confirmed as secretary by the U.S. Senate in February.

Asked to name promising areas of technological development, Wright focused on three particular areas of interest. Citing artificial intelligence, he noted that the interest in it was “overwhelming,” with many possible applications. Regarding fusion energy, Wright said, “We are going to see meaningful breakthroughs.” And quantum computing, he added, was going to be a “game-changer” as well.

Wright also emphasized the value of federal support for fundamental research, including projects in the national laboratories the Department of Energy oversees.

“The 17 national labs we have in this country are absolute jewels. They are gems of this country,” Wright said. He later noted, “There are things, like this foundational research, that are just an essential part of our country and an essential part of our future.”

Moniz asked Wright a range of questions in the fireside chat, while adding his own perspective at times about the many issues connected to energy abundance globally.

“Climate, energy, security, equity, affordability, have to be recognized as one conversation, and not separate conversations,” Moniz said. “That’s what’s at stake in my view.”

Wright’s appearance was part of the Energy Freedom Tour developed by the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), in coordination with the Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University. Later stops are planned for Stanford University and Texas A&M University.

Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute, gave remarks at the forum as well, noting the importance of making students aware of the energy industry and helping to “get them excited about the impact this career can make.” She also praised MIT’s advances in the field, adding, “This is where so many ideas were born and executed that have allowed America to really thrive in this energy abundance in our country that we have [had] for so long.”

The forum also featured remarks from Roger Martella, chief corporate officer, chief sustainability officer, and head of government affairs at GE Vernova. In March, MIT and GE Vernova announced a new five-year joint program, the MIT-GE Vernova Energy and Climate Alliance, featuring research projects, education programs, and career opportunities for MIT students.

“That’s what we’re about, electrification as the lifeblood of prosperity,” Martella said, describing GE Vernova’s work. “When we’re here at MIT we feel like we’re living history every moment when we’re walking down the halls, because no institution has [contributed] to innovation and technology more, doing it every single day to advance prosperity for all people around the world.”

A panel discussion at the forum featured Wright speaking along with three MIT alumni who are active in the energy business: Carlos Araque ’01, SM ’02, CEO of Quaise Energy, a leading-edge firm in geothermal energy solutions; Bob Mumgaard SM ’15, PhD ’15, CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a leading fusion energy firm and an MIT spinout; and Milo Werner SM ’07, MBA ’07, a general partner at DCVC and expert in energy and climate investments. The panel was moderated by Chris Barnard, president of the ACC.

Mumgaard noted that Commonwealth Fusion Systems launched in 2018 with “an explicit mission, working with MIT still today, of putting fusion onto an industrial trajectory,” although there is “plenty left to do, still, at that intersection of science, technology, innovation, and business.”

Araque said he believes geothermal is “metric-by-metric” more powerful and profitable than many other forms of energy. “This is not a stop-gap,” he added. Quaise is currently developing its first power-plant-scale facility in the U.S.

Werner noted that the process of useful innovation only begins in the lab; making an advance commercially viable is the critical next step. The biggest impact “is not in the breakthrough,” she said. “It’s not in the discovery that you make in the lab. It’s actually once you’ve built a billion of them. That’s when you actually change the world.”

After the forum, Wright took a tour of multiple research centers on the MIT campus, including the MIT.nano facility, guided by Vladimir Bulović, faculty director of MIT.nano and the Fariborz Maseeh Chair in Emerging Technology.

At MIT.nano, Bulović showed Wright the Titan Krios G3i, a nearly room-size electron microscope that enables researchers to take a high-resolution look at the structure of tiny particles, with a variety of research applications. The tour also viewed one of MIT.nano’s cleanrooms, a shared fabrication facility used by both MIT researchers and users outside of MIT, including many in industry.

On a different note, in an MIT.nano hallway, Bulović showed Wright the One.MIT mosaics, which contain the names of all MIT students and employees past and present — well over 300,000 in all. First etched on a 6-inch wafer, the mosaics are a visual demonstration of the power of nanotechnology — and a searchable display, so Bulović located Wright’s name, which is printed near the chin of one of the figures on the MIT seal.

The tour ended in the basement of Building 10, in what is now the refurbished Grainger Energy Machine Facility, where Wright used to conduct research. After earning his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, Wright entered into graduate studies at MIT before leaving, as he recounted at the forum, to pursue business opportunities.

At the lab, Wright met with David Perreault, the Ford Foundation Professor of Engineering; and Steven Leeb, the Emanuel Landsman Professor, a specialist in power systems. A half-dozen MIT graduate students gave Wright demos of their research projects, all involving energy-generation innovations. Wright readily engaged with all the graduate students about the technologies and the parameters of the devices, and asked the students about their own careers.

Wright was accompanied on the lab tour by MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan, himself an expert in developing energy-efficient systems. Chandrakasan delivered closing remarks at the forum in the Samberg Center, noting MIT’s “strong partnership with the Department of Energy” and its “long and proud history of engaging industry.”

As such, Chandrakasan said, MIT has a “role as a resource in service of the nation, so please don’t hesitate to call on us.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202510/MIT-Energy%20Secretary-01-press.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:12:01.345648

The group said the legislation is necessary in order to address some of the larger challenges facing the river basin, which stretches across 31 states. Issues like the annual Gulf of Mexico “dead zone” and floodwater control affect multiple states, requiring a more holistic approach, they claim.

“This is a national problem that needs a national solution,” Coalition Manager Gerald Blessey said in a release. “The Mississippi River Basin covers 41 percent of the continental United States.”

Mississippi commercial fisheries were hard hit in 2019, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to open the Bonnet Carré Spillway two times to divert floodwater away from population centers. That decision sent a surge of freshwater into the ocean, with the resultant drop in salinity shocking and killing shrimp, oysters, and other species. Those commercial fisheries are still struggling to recover. The U.S. government has since declared the incident fishery disaster, authorizing USD 88 million (EUR 80.6 million) in financial support to Southern states impacted by the event.

As cooler weather sets in, households across the country face a tough question: keep repairing their old heating and cooling systems or finally replace them with new ones.

While squeezing every penny out of an old unit might seem like a way to save money, experts caution that waiting can lead to higher costs, less comfort and missed opportunities for major savings.

The hidden cost of “just one more repair”

Older HVAC systems often need frequent service and those repair bills can add up. Bandage-type repairs on current units could lead to more surprise bills from repair people who usually do not offer financing plans. With contractor schedules filling up during peak seasons, a breakdown at the wrong time could mean long delays for repairs or replacements — leaving your home uncomfortable when you need it most.

Beyond the financial drain, there is the stress of dealing with an unexpected breakdown during extreme weather. Having to replace an HVAC system in the middle of a breakdown denies you the opportunity to shop around and purchase a system that best fits your home and needs. Similarly, replacing an unreliable system with a newer model can provide consistent comfort, improved efficiency and financial predictability.

Fall is the ideal time for replacement

Fall is considered the “shoulder season” in the HVAC industry. Contractors generally have more availability than during the busy summer and winter months, which makes scheduling easier. With the more moderate weather conditions during fall, you may be more comfortable without heating or cooling while the new system is being installed. Acting in fall also avoids the risk of facing a system failure in the middle of a cold snap when demand is high and options may be limited.

Incentives can make upgrading more affordable

For a limited time, programs are available to help homeowners manage the cost of replacement. This fall, certain high-efficiency systems from Carrier qualify for rebates of up to $2,100 and financing plans with 0% APR for 60 months, giving families the ability to spread out payments without extra interest.

In addition, federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offer homeowners tax credits — such as up to $2,000 back for installing a qualifying high-efficiency heat pump — further lowering the net cost. These IRA incentives are set to expire at the end of the year, making this fall the perfect time to upgrade.

Ensure comfort and efficiency during the holidays

The holiday season is a busy time and usually includes hosting loved ones. Guarantee your celebrations go off without a hitch and your guests stay warm and comfortable by replacing your old unit during the fall months.

Modern HVAC systems do more than heat and cool; they can help maintain balanced humidity, reduce drafts, improve air quality and eliminate uneven hot or cold spots throughout your home. Plus, the energy efficiency of your new heating and cooling system may help you save on monthly utility bills — savings you can put toward holiday shopping.

While it may be tempting to prolong the life of an old HVAC system, delaying replacement can end up being more expensive and stressful. With incentives, financing and tax credits available this fall, planning ahead can help you save money and enjoy year-round comfort.

Commonwealth LNG could go ahead and make a final investment decision on an $11 billion plant in Cameron Parish before the end of the year, Scott said.
And the $10 billion Lake Charles LNG retrofit could get a final investment decision before the end of 2026, he said.
The job gains in metro Monroe are entirely driven by the Meta data center, which will create 5,000 construction jobs and up to 500 permanent jobs.
The $18 billion expansion at the Venture Global LNG export terminal in Plaquemines Parish will provide a boost.","Louisiana is projected to add 74,500 jobs over the next two years, extending a five-year run of job gains in the state since the pandemic, due to expansions in the liquefied natural gas industry and construction of Meta’s $10 billion artificial intelligence data center.

The job gains, if they occur, would represent a faster pace of job growth than the state is projected to add in 2025, according to economist Loren Scott, who released his annual economic forecast earlier this week at the Louisiana Business Symposium, an economic conference hosted by the Greater Baton Rouge Business Report.

Scott said Louisiana is expected to finally have more than 2 million jobs by the end of the year, and that number will grow over the next two years.

The state has come close to breaking the 2 million mark for nonfarm jobs in 2015 and 2019, but a drop in oil prices, then the COVID pandemic caused job numbers to plunge.

""Let's hope for the best,"" Scott said, noting that while data centers and LNG export terminals are adding jobs, there could be disruptions, such as AI taking away the need for some workers.

Lake Charles, which has two LNG terminals under construction and could potentially add two more before the end of the year, and Monroe, which will benefit from the Meta data center and two Entergy power plants providing electricity for it, are expected to be the fastest-growing regions of the state, according to Scott.

Both Lake Charles and Monroe are expected to post an 8% gain in jobs by the end of 2027, Scott said. That would add 8,600 jobs in Lake Charles and 7,500 in Monroe.

Lake Charles is benefiting from the Trump administration’s decision to move ahead with permitting LNG facilities quickly. That’s in contrast to the Biden administration’s move to pause export permits on manufacturing plants such as Calcasieu Pass 2, while their impact on global warming could be studied.

Since April, Woodside Energy has announced plans for the $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG facility in Calcasieu Parish, while Venture Global has started work on CP2, a $15.1 billion facility. Each plant will create 7,500 temporary construction jobs and several hundred permanent jobs.

Commonwealth LNG could go ahead and make a final investment decision on an $11 billion plant in Cameron Parish before the end of the year, Scott said. And the $10 billion Lake Charles LNG retrofit could get a final investment decision before the end of 2026, he said.

The job gains in metro Monroe are entirely driven by the Meta data center, which will create 5,000 construction jobs and up to 500 permanent jobs. Entergy plans to spend $2.2 billion to build two natural gas power plants to meet the needs of the data center, which will be around the size of 70 football fields. The power needs of the plant are significant; the Center for Energy Studies at LSU estimates Meta’s consumption alone will boost electricity consumption in Louisiana by 15%.

Scott said that the other major employers in Monroe, such as the Foster Farms poultry plant, the Graphics Packaging paper plant and the JPMorgan Chase Mortgage customer service center, are expected to see employment hold steady or even fall slightly.

Baton Rouge is projected to see a 4.9% job gain over the next two years, adding 21,600 new positions, thanks to industrial construction in Ascension Parish. Scott said more than $20 billion in projects are in motion, most are in the 17,000-acre RiverPlex MegaPark, a mixed-use development on the west bank of the parish bordering the Mississippi River. The RiverPlex MegaPark development will be anchored by the $5.8 billion Hyundai steel mill project which Gov. Jeff Landry and Ascension Parish officials committed $600 million to upgrade the MegaPark land with a wastewater treatment plant, road and rail updates and land purchases. The project will create 1,300 direct jobs.

All of the other metro areas in Louisiana are expected to see job gains that fall below the 3.7% increase that is projected to happen over the next two years.

Hammond and St. Tammany Parish are both projected to see 3.4% gains in new jobs. Hammond will be boosted by expansions at North Oaks Health System and Southeastern Louisiana University, while St. Tammany will be boosted by continuing gains at Globalstar and Pool Corp.

Shreveport-Bossier City is expected to see 3.3% growth because of growth prospects at the Cyber Research Park, the former GM plant and the Port of Caddo-Bossier. There's a chance a data center could move into the area, because of the easy access to the abundant supply of cheap natural gas in the Haynesville Shale, Scott said.

Lafayette is forecast to see a 2.8% gain in jobs, as tariffs weigh down the offshore drilling industry. SafeSource Direct’s recent suspension of operations is also expected to hurt the local economy. The Broussard plant, which makes personal protective equipment, has laid off just under 700 employees.

New Orleans is expected to see a 2.4% gain in jobs, as the city is pulled down by a lagging convention business and financial difficulties at the University of New Orleans.

Globally, investors are pouring more money into renewable energy than ever — even as they pull back on spending in the U.S.

Over the first six months of this year, a total of $386 billion flowed to projects ranging from small rooftop solar installations to massive offshore wind farms, according to research firm BloombergNEF. That’s 10% higher than what investors doled out in the first half of 2024.

But the story is very different when you zoom in on the U.S.

As President Donald Trump enacts a scorched-earth campaign against renewables — particularly offshore wind — clean-energy investors are fleeing the nation’s increasingly volatile market. Spending was down by 12% compared to the first half of last year.

To an extent, the U.S.’s loss may have been Europe’s gain, according to BNEF. The European Union saw investment jump by 27% in the first half of this year, due in large part to major offshore wind developers shifting their focus from beleaguered projects on America’s East Coast to those in Europe’s North Sea. In the UK., another offshore wind hot spot, investment tripled compared to the first half of last year, rising to $6.6 billion.

That increasing interest in erecting turbines in European waters helped buoy global investment figures. The offshore wind sector may be crumbling in the U.S. under Trump, but worldwide, it attracted more money in the first six months of this year than in all of last year.

Small-scale solar is also quickly gaining ground, especially in China, where investment in the energy source almost doubled even as funding for utility-scale solar fell by 28% due to policy changes that make those larger projects less lucrative.

Overall, the investment figures are trending in the right direction: up.

Well, maybe.

The electric vehicle maker run by Musk reported Thursday that car sales jumped 7% in the three months through September after plunging for most of the year as people turned off by his embrace of President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe balked at buying his cars.

But the jump comes with a caveat: Tesla benefited from consumers taking advantage of a $7,500 tax credit before it expired on Sept. 30, a surge in buying that helped all EV makers.

In fact, many Tesla rivals saw sales rise more. Rivian Automotive reported a 32% increase.

Tesla stock rose sharply on the sales news, but closed the day down 4.5% to $439 amid skepticism the new number really signals a turnaround given all the anti-Musk backlash.

“I don’t think most people are any more enamored with Elon now than they were a few months ago,"" said Telemetry Insight's Sam Abuelsamid. ""I expect this is more a blip for Tesla than the restart of growth.”

Even Tesla bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities was cautious, noting there are ""still demand issues.”

Still, it was a blowout number with sales hitting 497,099 vehicles versus 462,890 in the same period last year. Analysts expected a small drop to 456,000.

Investors cheered Musk’s decision in April to leave Washington for Austin, Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. But he is still heavily involved in political and social wars, alienating potential car buyers.

On Wednesday, he posted on X that he was canceling his Netflix subscription because of critical comments made by the creator of a show on the streaming service, which appeared to spark a wave of cancellations in turn.

The sharp fall in Tesla stock Thursday was remarkable as investors have been surprisingly optimistic about the company in recent weeks despite terrible financial figures.

Investors drove the stock up 34% in September alone in a bet that Musk’s planned new cheaper version of his bestselling Model Y will recharge sales. Musk has also been successful in shifting investor attention away from cars to other aspects of the business — the rollout of its driverless robotaxi service planned for several cities and its Optimus robots for factory work and household chores.

Driving the stock higher has also been Musk’s apparent renewed focus on the company.

To hold his attention, Tesla's board proposed last month a pay package that would allow Musk to earn $1 trillion if he meets certain financial goals over the next several years. The pay offer, unprecedented for U.S. companies known for outsized CEO compensation, drew criticism from Pope Leo in an interview lamenting widening income gaps.

If Musk meets the goals, he could set a record on top of his own record. He recently became the first person ever to hit $500 billion in net worth, at least according to rich list compiler Forbes magazine.

The 7% sales rise in the last quarter compares with a 13% dropped in the first three months of the year when Musk led Trump's government cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. In the following three months through June, sales plunged 13% again.

The anti-Musk backlash in Europe had been also been fierce. Sales plunged 40% in more than two dozen countries after he publicly supported far-right politicians there.

Musk said a British prime minister was an ""evil tyrant"" who belongs in prison and told Germans ""things will get very, very much worse"" in their country if they didn't vote for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. Protests broke out in several cities, including a hanging of the billionaire in effigy in Milan and posters in London likening him to a Nazi.

For her part, the Tesla head of the board of directors who approved Musk’s latest pay package recently told Bloomberg that she is not sure if Musk’s politics have had any impact on the company’s finances. Robyn Denholm has earned nearly $700 million in compensation for serving on the board since 2014, a package that itself has drawn criticism.

Tesla reports third-quarter earnings later this month. Profits for the previous quarter fell 16% as the company continued to lose market share to European EV makers and fast-growing Chinese rivals, such as BYD.

Musk's new robotaxi service, which began with a test-run in Austin in June, has had some hitches with reports of the cabs stopping suddenly for no reason and even driving in the opposing lane in one instance. But Musk says the service will quickly roll out anyway with launches in several other cities by the end of next year.

Retail sales were estimated at 1.03 million units, up by 5.2% YoY, while fleet sales were thought to total 211k units, up by 7.2% YoY.

GM once again led the market, with total sales of 219k units, and a market share of 17.6%, its highest share since April. Toyota Group ranked second, with volumes of 186k units, but its market share was only 14.9%, the OEM’s lowest since March. Ford Group came in third, with sales of 160k units, and a share of 12.9%. The most unexpected result in September, however, was that Stellantis recorded its highest market share since June 2024, at 8.9%, and it was the first time that Stellantis had beaten Honda Group since that same month. A higher fleet share than is normal for several Stellantis brands appeared to partly explain this performance.

At a brand level, Toyota topped the rankings, on 159k units, ahead of Ford on 153k units and Chevrolet on 139k units.

The Ford F-150 returned to the top of the sales rankings in September, on 38.9k units, after having been usurped by the Toyota RAV4 in August. The F-150’s sales were disrupted by a recall in August, but did not appear to be too badly hindered in September. The RAV4 came in second, on 36.6k units, followed by the Chevrolet Equinox, on 31.4k units. The Equinox appeared to be boosted by sales of its EV variant, as buyers took advantage of EV tax credits before they expired.

According to initial estimates, Compact Non-Premium SUV was once again the bestselling segment, with a market share of 22.0%, a six-month high. Strong showings from the Hyundai Tucson and Hyundai IONIQ 5 helped to drive this performance. On the other hand, Midsize Non-Premium SUV saw its share slip to 16.3%, its lowest of Q3, as share for the Hyundai Palisade and Honda Prologue eased back from recent highs. In the case of the Prologue, a lack of inventory reportedly restricted the model from posting higher volumes. Meanwhile, the Large Pickup segment accounted for 14.0% of the market in September. Ram’s trucks recorded their highest market share of the year to date, but it remains to be seen whether this performance can be sustained.

David Oakley, Manager, Americas Sales Forecasts, GlobalData, said: “September rounded out Q3 with another strong result, continuing the recent theme of resilience in the face of upheaval in the industry. The removal of tax credits at the end of the month likely pulled forward sales of EVs, but the wider story is that even models of other propulsion types are performing much more robustly than would have been expected earlier in the year, given the backdrop of tariffs. There has still been very little movement in pricing, and incentives also remain steady, providing the environment for sales to continue flowing. Most automakers appear still to be doing their utmost to absorb cost pressures, and some have indicated a willingness to extend offers into October to cushion the blow from the lack of EV tax credits. The longer that consumers can be persuaded that price increases are imminent, the more motivation there will be to buy now, while a stock market near all-time highs is also helping to support activity. The big question now is whether Q4 will lead to a sharp drop in sales, or whether there will be a more gradual easing in selling rates. Some kind of slowdown still seems likely, but the final quarter of the year begins with more momentum than seemed probable just a few months ago”.

With nine months of the year now passed, the outlook for 2025 is looking more robust than expected at any point since tariffs became a reality. We remain of the view that there will be a slowdown in selling rates in Q4, but this now appears likely to be more modest than previously thought, and the market is entering Q4 on a stronger footing than expected. In fact, there is now a good chance that Light Vehicle sales will grow YoY, and we have revised up our full-year forecast to 16.0 million units. This would represent a YoY gain of around 0.4%, and would also mark the first time that the 16.0 million unit mark has been surpassed since 2019. There are risks on both sides of the forecast, and much is hanging on the extent to which OEMs can continue to keep pricing in check, in a market in which affordability is still a major concern.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/05/2024-Ford-F-150-Lariat_01.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 03:58:38.239318

While an absurdly high-horsepower EV might have always been a niche product, this also likely means Dodge is abandoning its 800-volt architecture upgrade for all Charger EVs.

While an absurdly high-horsepower EV might have always been a niche product, this also likely means Dodge is abandoning its 800-volt architecture upgrade for all Charger EVs. And that’s the only thing that could have given the next generation competitive charging speeds.

The Banshee trim was positioned as Dodge’s new Hellcat

The Mopar Insiders website claims that one of its “trusted supplier sources” spilled the beans on this latest shift at Stellantis. When Dodge first announced the new Charger Daytona EV, it showed off a concept car with a new “Banshee” badge. This high-horsepower trim was supposed to be the brand’s new Hellcat.

Dodge launched the Charger Daytona EV for the 2025 model year. But all the trim levels available only offered a 400-volt architecture. It makes very little sense to build a single model with both architectures, because once you’ve engineered an 800-volt EV, your material costs to produce it aren’t much higher. So I assumed once Dodge finished the Banshee, all future Charger Daytonas would have an 800-volt architecture.

Why 800 volts actually mattered for Dodge

This upgrade wouldn’t just improve electric motor output—it could dramatically improve the charging speed of all the Dodge EVs. That’s why many of the Charger Daytona’s competitors have 800-volt fast charging: Porsche EVs, Lucids, Hyundais, and the Cybertruck. But not older Tesla models, which Dodge would be able to vault ahead of.

In Dodge’s marketing material, it claimed the 400-volt Charger Daytona’s battery would go from 20% to 80% in just over 27 minutes while hooked up to a DC fast charger. When InsideEVs tested the car, it found this took over an hour. The publication even tried a second charger, and speeds were so slow the reviewers gave up after 47 minutes.

When MotorTrend tested the same car, it found it took 72 minutes to get the battery to 100%. Half an hour of charging added just 115 miles of range. When the publication confronted Dodge, the automaker promised an 800-volt architecture for the upcoming SRT trim.

What the future might hold

Here’s to hoping that even with the Banshee dead, Dodge forges ahead with an 800-volt architecture for all its future EVs—whether SRT products or not. Perhaps the next generation of its top-trim muscle cars will be internal combustion after all. But an inexpensive EV with reliable fast charging could be an excellent budget-friendly Dodge.",https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2024-Dodge-Charger-Daytona-SRT-Banshee-EV-concept-Detroits-NAIAS-via-Henry-Cesari-rear.JPG.jpeg?w=1200,N,,2025-10-03 03:58:41.922505

,EPA,2025-10-03 06:25:04+00:00,www.achrnews.com,EPA Proposes New Refrigerant Rule | ACHR News,"Joanna R. Turpin, the University of Washington",,,,,https://www.achrnews.com/articles/165340-epa-proposes-new-refrigerant-rule,"For retail food refrigeration, EPA is proposing to raise the GWP threshold to 1,400 (from 150 or 300), starting in 2026 for remote condensing units and 2027 for supermarket systems.
Both would be followed by a GWP threshold of 150 or 300 GWP starting in 2032.
“With this proposal, EPA is working to make American refrigerants affordable, safe, and reliable again.” Industry Reaction Industry groups are already weighing in on the proposed rule changes.
The group had previously filed a lawsuit over the initial rule, arguing that the timeline for supermarket refrigeration equipment was arbitrary and violated the AIM Act.
In a press release, FMI president and CEO Leslie G. Sarasin praised EPA for reconsidering the TT rule, noting that the original rule imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines.","Additionally, EPA is proposing to raise the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300 to 700 starting January 1, 2026, followed by a GWP limit of 150 or 300 starting in 2032. For retail food refrigeration, EPA is proposing to raise the GWP threshold to 1,400 (from 150 or 300), starting in 2026 for remote condensing units and 2027 for supermarket systems. Both would be followed by a GWP threshold of 150 or 300 GWP starting in 2032.

EPA framed these adjustments as a response to real-world challenges, noting in a press release that the 2023 TT rule “forced companies to switch to specific refrigerants like designer HFC blends for residential air conditioning and ammonia or carbon dioxide for supermarket and cold storage refrigeration equipment, contributing to an increase in consumer costs and shortages.”

The agency added that shortages of HFC blends left families without air conditioning during this summer’s extreme heat.

“Not only has this left Americans unable to afford or access the necessary refrigerants to install critical equipment, but it has also put public safety and human health at risk, as substances like ammonia are more toxic and flammable.”

In addition, with only 15 months’ notice, the EPA’s timeline may not allow safe compliance.

“Hardworking Americans have made their voices and frustrations heard about the lack of availability of refrigerant alternatives during hot summer months and regulations that increase the cost of living for families. Today, the Trump EPA is heeding the call for change,” said Zeldin. “With this proposal, EPA is working to make American refrigerants affordable, safe, and reliable again.”

Industry Reaction

Industry groups are already weighing in on the proposed rule changes. FMI – The Food Industry Association, for example, welcomed the revisions. The group had previously filed a lawsuit over the initial rule, arguing that the timeline for supermarket refrigeration equipment was arbitrary and violated the AIM Act.

In a press release, FMI president and CEO Leslie G. Sarasin praised EPA for reconsidering the TT rule, noting that the original rule imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines. She added that the proposed new rule would balance environmental goals with economic realities.

“This revised proposal is critical to preventing the rule from unnecessarily driving up grocery prices,” she said. “A balanced approach will provide retail stores with additional time to comply and reduce the implementation challenges associated with the rule, including a lack of available technology, continued installation and technician shortages, among other factors.”

The Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors – National Association (PHCC) also expressed support for certain elements of the proposed rule. Chuck White, vice president of regulatory affairs, said PHCC supports eliminating the sell-through period for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump products, calling it a practical solution that avoids the costly problem of stranded inventory.

“Allowing installation of products manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025, will keep consumers from ultimately having to absorb the cost of equipment that was abandoned due to the date on the calendar,” he said. “PHCC will continue to review the other industry-related sections of the proposed EPA reconsideration and prepare comments for the Agency’s consideration.”

The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) is currently reviewing the proposed rule and will also have extensive comments by the deadline, said Samantha Slater, vice president of government affairs. In a press release, AHRI reiterated several of its well-established positions on the existing 2023 rule, including:

Delaying the TT rule transition dates would disrupt multi-year planning and investment by U.S. manufacturers. Companies have already retooled production, certified new equipment, and built supply chains around the current schedule;

Maintaining the current dates avoids duplicative costs, dual inventories, and confusion in the marketplace. Delays would force manufacturers and distributors to manage redundant product lines and training programs;

A delay would re-open the U.S. market to outdated, high-GWP equipment, giving foreign manufacturers a competitive advantage. This would penalize American firms that acted in good faith to comply with the AIM Act;

Certainty under the AIM Act supports stable refrigerant supply, protects domestic jobs, and prevents fragmented state rules. Reopening the rule would invite a patchwork of requirements across jurisdictions; and

Over time, delays would increase costs for manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and end users. Staying on schedule lowers costs, supports investment recovery, and ensures affordable, energy-efficient equipment for consumers.

“As stated many times previously, it’s important to remember that the existing TT rule applies only to newly manufactured equipment,” said Slater. “Existing systems can operate through their full useful life, and components will remain available to ensure that servicing is not disrupted.""

HARDI is also analyzing the impact of the proposed rule, including how it will affect future refrigerant supplies by changing which refrigerants are used in commercial refrigeration, said Alex Ayers, vice president of government affairs.

“We want to make sure this rule does not create major shortages in the future by increasing demand for refrigerants with high-GWPs on systems that can last over 25 years.”

Another concern, said Ayers, is that the EPA’s many proposed changes affect deadlines that are just three months away, making it doubtful the rule will be finalized by year’s end and creating uncertainty for distributors.

“The current government shutdown could delay the rule even further, since the Federal Register cannot post the rule to open the comment period until the government reopens, which delays the start of the 45-day comment period.”

Most importantly, Ayers stressed that the proposal is not yet final.

“No legal requirements have changed yet and won’t change until the final rule is released, so we’re asking our members to continue to follow the requirements in place now until the changes are finalized.”",https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2025/10/02/Idaho-condensing-unit.jpg?height=635&t=1759437484&width=1200,N,,2025-10-03 02:58:36.646894

The move comes as Ford CEO warns that Trump policies will further hurt the US EV market

Enchem Co., a South Korean battery materials maker, has scrapped its plan to invest $143 million to build a plant in the US due to the protracted downturn in the world’s third-largest electric vehicle market, industry sources in Seoul said on Wednesday.

Enchem, the world’s No. 4 electrolyte manufacturer, has canceled its plan to spend 200 billion won ($142.7 million) to construct a production base in Tennessee to supply the battery component to BlueOval SK LLC, a joint venture between South Korea’s battery maker SK On Co. and US automaker Ford Motor Co., the sources said.

Enchem had planned to provide electrolytes from the plant to BlueOval SK, but supply deals, which were expected to be signed last year, were repeatedly delayed.

An electrolyte facilitates the movement of ions between the anode and cathode, enabling the battery to charge and discharge by transporting electrical charge in the form of ions, not electrons.

Enchem’s decision came as Ford’s EV business remained sluggish. Ford’s EV division has lost $12 billion in total, including $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025.

US ELIMINATES EV TAX CREDIT

US President Donald Trump’s policies to boost internal combustion engine vehicles also hurt the EV industry. The US administration eliminated the tax credit benefit of up to $7,500 for EV buyers starting this month.

Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said on Wednesday that the elimination and softening of emissions rules will sharply curtail EV demand in the US.

He predicted the share of zero-emission vehicles, which is currently around 10% of the domestic market, could fall by half.

The policies are expected to affect not only the EV industry but also the battery sector.

ALL REVISE US BUSINESS STRATEGIES

BlueOval SK, the total capacity of which is likely to rise to 127 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by next year, is predicted to underutilize its facilities.

“All companies involved in the local EV value chain with Ford are now revising their strategies,” said an industry source in Seoul.

Instead of moving forward with the Tennessee project, Enchem plans to focus its investments on its Georgia facility, which supplies electrolytes to LG Energy Solution Ltd., and its Indiana plant, which serves Samsung SDI Co.

The same study projected that, by 2028, that figure could reach 12%, with data centers consuming as much as 580 terawatt-hours per year.
How often do you worry about your energy bills?
If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse.
With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast.","A new analysis by Bloomberg has uncovered the extraordinary impact that power-hungry data centers already have had on the electricity bills of millions of ordinary Americans, and the news is not good.

Over the past five years, Americans who live in areas near data centers have seen their electricity bills increase by as much as 267%, Bloomberg found.

""It's killing my pockets,"" said Antoinette Robinson, a resident of East Baltimore, Maryland, per Bloomberg.

What's happening?

As massive new data centers used to power artificial-intelligence models and cloud computing have sprouted up across the U.S. and around the world, they have consumed larger and larger amounts of electricity, outpacing new sources of electricity production.

According to basic economic principles, when demand goes up faster than supply, prices increase. As a result, millions of Americans, many of whom already were struggling to make ends meet, have seen their electric bills skyrocket.

""Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans,"" said David Crane, the CEO of Generate Capital, per Bloomberg. Crane warned the strain on power supplies in certain markets could result in brownouts as soon as the next year or two.

In 2023, data centers consumed 4.4% of all electricity produced in the U.S., according to a Department of Energy study. The same study projected that, by 2028, that figure could reach 12%, with data centers consuming as much as 580 terawatt-hours per year.

By way of comparison, in 2019, the entire country of Canada consumed a total of 530 terawatt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. That year, Canada ranked sixth out of all nations in terms of energy consumption.

Why does data-center power consumption matter?

While many experts have warned of the coming data-center power crunch, Bloomberg's analysis has shown that, for many Americans, the electricity shortages have already become a harsh economic reality.

Nicole Pastore, who has seen her own electricity costs go up by 50% in just the past year, serves as a judge overseeing rental disputes in Baltimore. In that capacity, she has observed firsthand the impact that skyrocketing power prices have had on many of the city's most vulnerable residents.

How often do you worry about your energy bills?

Every day 😥

A few times a week 😟

A few times a month 🙁

Only when I pay it 😬

Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.

""It's utilities versus rent,"" Pastore explained, per Bloomberg. ""They want to stay in their home, but they also want to keep their lights on.""

Many hard-hit residents wonder why they should have to, in effect, subsidize the country's AI boom, while already-wealthy tech companies rake in the resulting profits.

""They can say this is going to help with AI, but how is that going to help me?"" asked Kevin Stanley, an East Baltimore resident who is unable to work because of his glaucoma, according to Bloomberg. ""How's that going to help me pay my bill?""

What's being done about skyrocketing energy prices?

If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse. As tech companies in the U.S. race to keep pace in the fierce competition to dominate artificial intelligence, even more massive — and more power-hungry — data centers are in the works.

With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast. Meanwhile, policymakers could force tech companies to pay more for their own energy use and the strain they place on power grids, rather than pushing those costs onto consumers.

Unfortunately, recent policy changes have turned the U.S. away from cleaner, renewable sources of energy and toward dirtier, extracted fuels, which has hurt both the prospects for new electricity production and the environment.

According to S&P Global, the worldwide waiting list for the turbines used in gas-fueled power plants is currently seven years long, not nearly fast enough to meet rising demand.

By comparison, renewable-energy facilities such as solar arrays and wind farms can be brought online much more quickly and at much lower environmental costs.

To make a difference, you can help push for a return to policies that favor cleaner, renewable-energy production by contacting your elected representatives and voting for candidates who share your energy priorities.

Additionally, by installing solar panels on your home, you can drop your own electricity bill to practically zero while also reducing demand on already-maxed-out power grids.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/data-center-electricity-billsimage-recD51onMTapKBkD8-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:59:37.401576

The specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill.
After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day.
The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.
Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities.","The Trump administration is canceling about $8 billion in grants for energy projects in mostly Democratic-led states — but is allowing funding to continue for similar projects in states that voted for Trump.

The canceled grants, which were first announced by the Office of Management and Budget’s director, Russell Vought, on Wednesday, don’t total anywhere close to all of the energy investments made by the Biden administration, which Vought called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

For now, energy project money appears to be continuing to flow to companies and institutions located in red and swing states, even though the work these institutions are doing is very similar to the work that was cut, according to a NOTUS analysis of hundreds of projects across the country, including the latest cancellations.

For example, the administration canceled $460 million in funding for the Democrat-led state of Minnesota to build much-needed interregional transmission lines (power lines that connect the country’s separated parts of the grid).

It left in place a $700 million grant from the same program that will connect the eastern and western U.S. grids in Montana, a state that voted for Trump and is led by Republicans.

The administration also canceled funding to improve the resilience of the power grid in Hawaii from wildfires and other extreme weather, as well as $40 million in funding for a project to build a resilient backup microgrid for Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and the island of Oahu.

It did not cut the $160 million that was awarded in the same funding round from the same program for Georgia Power to make the state’s electric grid more resilient.

And of the 17 projects the Department of Energy awarded for battery recycling and reprocessing innovations, the list of cuts included just three: one in Colorado and two in California. There’s no obvious difference between those three projects and the remaining 14 that appear to still be funded, beyond the fact that some of the others are located at national labs or in states that either voted for Trump or are led by Republicans, like Utah, Virginia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

And while the administration canceled billions in funding for hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, hubs that touch states including Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Indiana appear fine for now.

The specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill. There is discussion on the Hill between some Democrats and Republicans in the states affected by the cuts about pushing for a restoration of the funds as part of a deal to end the shutdown, one source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested as much to Fox News on Thursday when asked about the program cuts.

“Pass the clean, continuing resolution and all of this goes away,” she said, directed at Democrats.

But just hours later, Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested that a reversal of the cuts was not on the table. In an interview on CNN Thursday night, he said that the decision to cancel the funding had nothing to do with the shutdown.

When asked about why the affected projects were all in states that voted for Kamala Harris last November, Wright denied that the administration was targeting Democrats and said that more cancellations were coming down the pipe — including in red states. “This is a partial list of an ongoing process. More project announcements will come,” he said.

The Trump administration’s announcement sowed confusion for the companies and states affected. After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day. Some local authorities said they have still not received official notice from the DOE, including the state of Colorado and the California Energy Commission.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said he had lunch with Energy Secretary Chris Wright “minutes before” the cancellations were announced, but received no warning.

“He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included 10 projects in my state, projects that affect real jobs and real families,” Heinrich said in a statement. “That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions.”

The grant cancellations span projects aimed to improve electrical grid infrastructure, innovate on battery recycling, create new forms of energy storage, lower buildings’ energy usage and advance hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Many of the projects would carry benefits and jobs outside of the states they are based in, especially those that would affect the resilience and performance of the nation’s aging electric grid.

A number of recipients are losing multiple projects, including some institutions whose goals could serve the Trump administration’s interests. GTI Energy, which is focused on modernizing the natural gas industry, lost 13 grants. Both GE Vernova, a maker of wind and gas turbines, and the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit electricity research organization, lost 11. The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.

Many of the projects on this list have already begun operations, which means the money that has been distributed for these projects so far will be wasted if operations halt, another source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

Lindsay VanLaningham, a spokesperson for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a community-owned electric utility, said in a statement to NOTUS that as of Thursday evening, the DOE had not yet notified them of any changes to their grant, which funds “a portion of a project already in flight.”

Some of the canceled awards are listed by the Energy Department as targeting blue states, but the impacted projects themselves are located in red states. For instance, a $19.7 million federal award to IBM related to methane emissions research is categorized under awards cancelled to entities New York — but a description of the project published in 2024 said it will be carried out entirely in western states that voted for Trump, including Utah, Montana and Alaska.

There are more areas for confusion: The list of cancellations includes some, but not all, grants that the DOE first announced in May that it was canceling, primarily for clean energy industrial demonstrations.

And some of the affected entities are getting information that conflicts from the DOE press release. The department says entities have 30 days to appeal the cancellations, but one affected group told NOTUS their instructions say they only have 10 days to appeal.

Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities. For example, the administration has issued executive orders and memos emphasizing the importance of mineral development and extraction in the United States. Recycling used batteries is one way to increase the availability of minerals and metals like lithium, but three of the grants in that program have been axed.

Some companies have confirmed with NOTUS that they are now receiving cancellation notices. Those include Smartville, a California-based company that was building a long-duration battery storage project, and Sublime Systems, which was originally told in May its grants had been cancelled and has been in the appeals process since then.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/c4c6a33/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5096x2867+0+265/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2Ff8%2Fa8e94e18431c9f708b764478d761%2Fap25169565568734.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:59:42.389500

The new station is located at Sheetz in Pittsburgh on Freeport Road along Interstate 76 (Exit 48).

Since the first NEVI-funded station opened in PA, the charging stations have delivered more than 30,000 charging sessions, powering over 3.5 million estimated miles driven and reducing CO2 emissions by more than 1.7 million pounds (or 750 metric tons).

Additionally, PennDOT announced that it is the first state to receive a Full Build-Out Certification under the new federal NEVI guidance issued in August. The build-out certification allows a state to move beyond the initial phase of the NEVI program that focused on building charging stations on the core network of interstate highways, enabling PennDOT to begin the next stage of the NEVI program — Corridor Connections(opens in a new tab) — which will be released on or before October 7, 2025.

“Thanks to our team’s diligent work in 2023 and 2024, and Governor Shapiro’s persistent efforts to secure Congressionally appropriated funding, we’re in a position to continue making EVs more accessible for PA travelers,” said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. ""That quick action ensured Pennsylvania could adapt to national program changes while locking in investments for Pennsylvania.""

Per NEVI guidance issued August 11, PennDOT submitted an updated Pennsylvania NEVI State Plan(opens in a new tab) and a second request for Full Build-Out Certification to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on August 27, 2025. The next phase will begin projects that connect communities. The NEVI State Plan was approved on September 5, 2025, and PennDOT received Full Build-Out Certification on September 22, 2025. Having received approval, the Shapiro Administration is moving forward with the community phase of the NEVI program, beginning with the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity.

The Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity(opens in a new tab) focuses on implementing EV charging stations along major roadways to strengthen long-distance travel outside of previously designated Alternative Fuel Corridors(opens in a new tab). These locations are expected to serve the communities and regions near the charging station locations. Projects funded from the Corridor Connections program will improve range confidence for drivers who are considering travel with an EV across and throughout the Commonwealth.

PennDOT anticipates soliciting about 24 projects through the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity, with up to $20 million in available funding. The Funding Opportunity is expected to include more than 1,000 miles of roadway and incorporate sections of:

Nevins, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://thefulcrum.us/governance-legislation/health-care-tax-credits-2025,"“So the message is not, ‘Never take Tylenol,’ ” he said, contradicting Trump’s own words.
“The Occam’s razor answer is the influence of RFK Jr., who is carrying water for his friends in the plaintiffs bar.
The current hyperpolarization, apathy, and extremism are incompatible with the preservation of these freedoms and the protection of our country.
The extreme polarization tearing our country apart is the consequence of our failing educational and scientific institutions.
Luke Harris is an op-ed author who writes about the US, UK, and international politics, policy, and culture.","As he struggled again to say “acetaminophen,” and asked someone off camera, “Is that OK?” when he finally managed to get his lips around the word, the moment was a perfect encapsulation of the dumbing down of expertise and the political corruption of science under this administration.

He said that taking acetaminophen, or Tylenol, while pregnant has been associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” a claim pushed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy with little to no basis in scientific fact.

“Taking Tylenol is not good,” Trump declared, as if anyone in their right mind would take medical advice from a guy who suggested injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus.

Scientists — people who, unlike Trump and Kennedy, have actual expertise in these matters — objected. Dr. Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University called the announcement “appalling” and “a very significant distortion” of what science says about any possible links.

The Coalition of Autism Scientists said: “The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”

And Sura Alwan, a clinical teratologist at the University of British Columbia, said, “The evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen or vaccines and autism.”

The absurdity of Trump and Kennedy doling out medical advice, when the former promoted taking anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine to ward off COVID-19 — and then contracted COVID-19 himself — and the latter believes chemicals in drinking water can make someone gay or trans, should not be lost on anyone.

Everyone should ignore these crackpot Looney Tunes and trust their doctors and pediatricians, not two politicians cosplaying at science, whose long and sordid history of bad advice could lead to serious injury or death.

And while MAGA-world usually falls in line quickly to defend even Trump’s worst impulses — see Jan. 6, see Russia, see tariffs — this time Tweedledum and Tweedledee aren’t getting quite the support they’re used to. That’s how bad this is.

Less than a day after Trump made his announcement, his own administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz, went on MAGA favorite Fox News to walk it back.

“So the message is not, ‘Never take Tylenol,’ ” he said, contradicting Trump’s own words. “It’s, ‘Take Tylenol judiciously.’ Take it by talking with your doctor.”

Also on Fox, the network’s own senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel asked and answered the question pretty definitively. “Does acetaminophen during pregnancy cause autism? People out there need to know there’s absolutely no proof whatsoever that that’s the case.”

In Congress, there’s been some rare pushback, too. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN he was “very concerned” and insisted, “science ought to guide these discussions.”

Sen. Bill Cassidy, a licensed physician, posted on X, “HHS should release the new data that it has to support this claim. The preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case.”

And Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal blasted Trump and Kennedy’s anti-Tylenol campaign, pointing to lawsuits against the maker of Tylenol and what may be personal interests in those outcomes.

“What’s going on here has less to do with healthcare than with a campaign by the plaintiffs bar,” wrote the Journal’s editorial board. “If a drug company made the unproven claims aired at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration would threaten legal action.”

“So why the sudden alarm, complete with a presidential presser?” it continued. “The Occam’s razor answer is the influence of RFK Jr., who is carrying water for his friends in the plaintiffs bar. A who’s-who of lawsuit shops are pushing the Tylenol-autism link in federal court. The transparent goal is to drum up more claims to drive a bigger damage award or settlement.”

I’m not even sure Trump believes all of the garbage he spewed on Monday. In his inimitable way, he seemed to distance himself from what he was selling, saying, “This is based on what I feel,” and “You know, I’m making these statements from me, I’m not making them from these doctors,” and “I’m not a doctor, but I’m giving my opinion.”

So when asked if it was appropriate for him to tell the public what to do, given it was based on his “feelings,” he answered it was “absolutely appropriate.”

Chef’s kiss.

Representative Democracy is a form of self-governing; our Constitution delineates a set of values and principles that evolve and materialize as Americans exercise their rights to challenge societal norms and create legal and social change. The Democratic state produces the circumstances that provide the greatest freedoms, such that they are consistent with equality under the law: the liberties to freely express one’s ideas, vote in open elections to decide the politicians who will represent our diverse interests, and defend against leaders or citizens who endanger these freedoms. The current hyperpolarization, apathy, and extremism are incompatible with the preservation of these freedoms and the protection of our country. This is the deleterious effect of the failure of our educational and scientific institutions.

Liberalism is curring the flamer, sniffy, childhood-enduring preconceptions, and unthoughtful, or unchallenged beliefs—the ideas and attitudes that provide the easiest answers, but often perpetuate in collective thinking, and social pressure; the accountability of schools—in K-12, and higher education—to teach students how to think critically; preparing citizens of a democracy, with any level of education, to synthesize information and form their opinions independent of group identity or ideology. However, my teachers taught critical thinking as an intellectual skill and did not properly acknowledge or instill its value. The consequence of learning to think independently and reexamine yourself, your thoughts, and your beliefs should be uncomfortable; it can be linked to losing your social/self-identity, questioning your faith or secular-moral values, and often facing disapproval from your parents and friends. The issue is exacerbated in higher education, where there is social pressure to think in a certain way, and professors continue to teach students what to think, rather than how to think.

Furthermore, the conversation needs to include everyone. Someone with a thought disorder, people who are prone to emotional outbursts, have social or communication challenges, or have lower intelligence, or learning disabilities, are being excluded from these conversations. If someone does not have the words to express their ideas, whatever they can say could direct the group to new ways of thinking; if someone is mentally disabled, they may change how people talk with each other, and bring a different emotional attitude. However, if the person is not intelligent or they are harder to speak with, we are denying them entry into these types of discussions where they can provide value. Personally, in early elementary school, I had many of these problems. My experience is different; I make connections more fluidly, I have less linear thinking, but I can present as neurotypical and intelligent. People will listen and consider what I have to say, but someone who cannot communicate as clearly or is harder to talk with does not receive the same respect. The consequence is reinforcing the same ideas and providing only one way to think.

The scientific community is responsible for engaging in public discourse, making their discoveries and ideas accessible to the public, and honestly discussing criticisms and challenges to their work, which includes spotlighting different public figures in their field. If topics or theories are backed by strong empirical evidence, then scientists should denounce and criticize the merits, character, and fitness of those people presenting unbacked science or dangerous assertions. However, consistent appeals to authority and consensus are a strong indication that members of the scientific community are succumbing to social pressure or represent a homogenous intellectual class. The contributions of science are essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy. For this reason, classicist-collectivist behavior across various fields of research is concerning and also symptomatic of educational institutions that have failed to effectively instill the values and skills discussed above—those most essential for serious inquiry.

Democracy is unsustainable and short-lasting when there are severe restrictions on freedom of expression. The highest form of expression is holding your representatives accountable to your interests, both by speaking loudly and voting out incumbents when they are dishonest, unresponsive, and unrepresentative of their constituents. In any democracy where the party convention suppresses contest and does not put forth any alternative options, it is necessary to vote against party lines, because elected officials who are assured of their reelection are no longer accountable to represent the interests of their constituents. There is contention in democracies about the extent of acceptable speech. The line for the strongest advocates is often hate speech, and the debate about the function and benefits of hate speech should remain lively. However, there is a strong argument that protecting hate is necessary for remaining vigilant and aware of the dangerous fringes and movements within a democracy.

The excursions into democratic governing have not proven to be sustainable in the long term. This form of government is the freest and rests on the maintenance and continuance of the freedoms it provides—these freedoms and the institutions, such as schools, and the scientific establishment, serve specific purposes that both represent what democracy is, why democracy is the most befitting to the protection of human dignity, and justice, and the factors that determine how well and how long any democracy will function. The first step forward is understanding that polarization is the consequence, not the cause. The extreme polarization tearing our country apart is the consequence of our failing educational and scientific institutions.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules that it says can’t be justified.","The Trump administration is canceling $7.6 billion in grants that supported clean energy projects in 16 states — including Colorado, where more than $550 million in funding is set to be eliminated in what the state decried as “politically motivated targeting.”

The U.S. Department of Energy said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated nationwide after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable.

Twenty entities in Colorado were on that list, including the University of Colorado, Colorado School of Mines, Tri-State Generation and Transmission, businesses dedicated to emissions reductions such as solar companies, and nonprofits that promote clean energy — including one that works with Indian tribes on clean energy projects.

The largest chunk of money being stripped involves $326 million for Colorado State University’s research toward reducing methane, a potent planet-warming gas, from oil and gas wells, The New York Times reported.

Two Colorado Energy Office grants that are targeted would provide $5 million to support programs that improve energy efficiency and cut carbon emissions from buildings.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown. Most of the projects being terminated were budgeted for states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election and have Democratic governors and senators.

Ari Rosenblum, a spokesperson for the Colorado Energy Office, said in a written statement that the office had not formally received any official federal notices of termination, but understood that two of its projects were on the list, “which specifically targets states where a majority of Americans cast their votes in favor of the Democratic nominee for president.”

“This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution and create instability in our business community,” Rosenblum said.

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Aurora, accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the federal government to punish people who did not vote for him.

“This spiteful and cruel decision will raise energy bills and mean the loss of good-paying jobs in Colorado,” Crow said in a statement. “We will not kiss the ring of a wannabe king. This blatant intimidation and act of retribution is illegal.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is from Colorado and is the founder of Denver-based Liberty Energy, an oilfield services company, said in a news release that his department had been reviewing financial awards since he was appointed by Trump and was attempting to trim waste.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” said Wright, who has opposed any efforts to combat climate change. “Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

The Energy Department did not respond to The Denver Post’s request for an interview with Wright.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”

The elimination of hundreds of grants is likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules that it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health.

Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

QBE insurance companies are rated ""A"" (Excellent) by A.M. Best and ""A+"" by Standard & Poor's.","The advertising landscape has fundamentally shifted as brands redirect their marketing dollars from traditional media to where consumers spend their time: social media platforms. This transformation has created a new economy of social media influencers, ranging from those earning modest side income to multi-millionaire content creators who command global audiences.

However, this rapidly growing sector presents unique challenges that traditional insurance products weren’t designed to address. As influencer partnerships become more sophisticated and widespread, both creators and the brands that hire them face potential liability exposures that can result in significant financial consequences.

The Rise of the Influencer Economy

The financial potential in influencer marketing spans an enormous range. “There’s a huge range in influencer revenue. At the top end, you have celebrity influencers earning millions of dollars. At the other end, it’s people with just a thousand followers who might earn very little money,” said Chris Cooper, SVP, U.S. Head of Media & Professions at QBE North America.

“In the middle, are influencers who typically represent the greatest risk and opportunity. These are influencers who earn tens of thousands of dollars per year. This demographic represents creators who have moved beyond hobbyist status but haven’t yet reached the level where they employ business managers or have sophisticated risk management strategies.”

The shift in advertising spending reflects broader consumer behavior changes. “Advertising dollars have shifted from traditional print media, digital banners, and TV commercials to platforms where people’s eyes are—primarily social media,” Cooper said. “A lot of this advertising comes in the form of sponsored reviews or influencers talking about their experiences with products and how the items have helped in their daily lives.”

Emerging Liability Risks in Influencer Marketing

The authentic, personal nature of influencer content that makes it effective also creates unique liability exposures. Unlike traditional advertising, which goes through multiple layers of legal review, influencer content is often created quickly by individuals who may not understand the legal implications of their posts.

Cooper explained how QBE became aware of this growing problem: “We’re a traditional media liability insurer that has been in this space since 2013 in North America and longer elsewhere in the world. We insure companies that are in the business of creating and disseminating content against exposures like copyright infringement, defamation, invasion of privacy, false light, and right of publicity.”

QBE’s existing relationships with specialized law firms revealed a growing trend. “We work with many law firms specializing in advertising law, copyright law, and defamation that started informing us they were defending non-media companies for claims arising from content created by small or midsize influencers who had made mistakes,” Cooper said.

The financial burden of these mistakes often falls on the brands rather than the influencers themselves. “Because these influencers typically didn’t have insurance or sufficient assets, the larger brands that hired them ended up bearing the entire burden from a claims payment, claims handling, and defense counsel perspective,” he said.

One particularly common issue involves music licensing. “We’ve seen numerous slip-ups by influencers and brands where they’ve allowed music to play in the background of content,” Cooper said. “Even something as simple as having music playing in the background while recording promotional content for a brand would constitute potential copyright infringement without a proper synchronization license.”

The distinction between personal and commercial use creates additional complexity. “Most platforms have blanket synchronization licensing agreements with music publishers, but these are strictly for personal use,” Cooper explained. “However, once content shifts to advertising and commercial purposes, the available music library narrows significantly. There’s a fine line between when an influencer is posting personally versus commercially, and many aren’t aware of this distinction.”

The timing of legal intervention also affects outcomes. “The law firms told us they were getting cases very late in the process, hurting both the brand and influencer’s chances of successfully defending their cases,” Cooper said.

QBE’s Specialized Solution for Influencer Media Liability

Drawing on its decade-plus experience in traditional media liability coverage, QBE developed a targeted solution, The Influencer by QBE, that addresses the specific challenges brands face when working with influencers. The approach combines education, insurance coverage, and streamlined claims management.

“Rather than simply writing policies for every influencer, we created a product addressing the core problem our larger insureds were facing,” Cooper said. “This product recognizes that even companies with existing media liability policies face challenges with influencer-related claims due to high deductibles and coverage gaps.”

Education forms a cornerstone of QBE’s approach. “We really leaned into that educational aspect by creating a short learning module. A 30-minute video covers the major topics influencers need to watch out for, followed by a short quiz,” Cooper said. “The video covers essential areas of media and advertising law that influencers need to understand from copyright and trademark to defamation and right of publicity.”

The insurance coverage itself reflects the unique structure of influencer partnerships. “The policy covers both the brand and the influencer, but solely for the actions of the influencer,” Cooper explained. “This isn’t meant to replace a larger media liability or Errors & Omissions policy for a large company. It’s designed to address that specific influencer-related problem we kept hearing about.”

The coverage structure aligns with how influencer campaigns typically operate and provides dedicated coverage for each campaign. “Influencers are typically hired for specific campaigns with contractual obligations. For example, they might be contracted to create 20 posts about a lavender latte. Then they might get another contract for 10 posts about a pumpkin spice latte,” Cooper said. “We’ve set an occurrence-based $250K limit for each of those contracts.”

The Influencer launched in mid-August 2025 and is distributed through brokers who can manage the process of getting influencers signed up with the training and coverage. “The brand and broker can direct influencers to our dedicated web page where they provide basic information and complete the required training,” Cooper explained.

Looking ahead, the scale of influencer marketing continues to expand. “Some brands and large companies work with thousands of influencers,” Cooper said. “As this market grows, specialized risk management solutions become increasingly critical for protecting both creators and the brands that partner with them.”

One refiner petitioner, Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc., owned by Delek U.S. Holdings Inc., filed a motion with the DC Circuit Court the same day of the EPA motion, opposing holding that case in abeyance.

(DTN) -- Because of the federal government shutdown the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency filed multiple requests to hold biofuels litigation in abeyance in at least one federal court.

The EPA filed a motion in multiple biofuels cases on Wednesday before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Columbia Circuit, and in at least one of those cases the plaintiffs are opposing the agency's motion.

""At the end of the day on Sept. 30, 2025, the appropriations act that had been funding the Department of Justice expired and those appropriations to the department lapsed,"" the EPA says in the motions.

""The same is true for the majority of other executive agencies, including EPA. The department does not know when such funding will be restored by Congress. Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of EPA are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including 'emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.'""

The motion said that if a stay is granted in cases that make a variety of challenges to the Renewable Fuel Standard, then government counsel would notify the court when funds are restored.

""Therefore, although we greatly regret any disruption caused to the court and the other litigants, the government hereby moves for an abeyance of these consolidated cases until Department of Justice attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions,"" the motion said.

One refiner petitioner, Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc., owned by Delek U.S. Holdings Inc., filed a motion with the DC Circuit Court the same day of the EPA motion, opposing holding that case in abeyance.

""To begin with, there is no legal impediment to EPA meeting its deadlines,"" the company said.

""As DOJ's plan recognizes, if a court denies a request for a stay, 'the government will comply with the court's order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue.'""

The DC Circuit Court announced on Wednesday that it ""will continue normal operations"" during the shutdown and that ""parties remain obligated to meet all scheduled deadlines for filing.""

The company said the court had ""materially identical contingency plans"" during shutdowns in 2013 and 2019.

""So, absent agreement from the parties, the court did not grant 'a single motion seeking a stay' of oral argument 'during the 2013 shutdown' and extended the 'same' 'practice' to motions to stay briefing during the 2019 shutdown,"" the company said.

In a lawsuit filed by Clean Fuels Alliance and Growth Energy against the EPA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, so far the agency has not asked the court to place that litigation in abeyance.

In that case the groups sued to press the agency to finalize Renewable Fuel Standard volumes. The groups told that court that all sides could reach a consent decree in the case to finalize the latest RFS volumes by Dec. 31, 2025.

Well, maybe.

The electric vehicle maker run by Musk reported Thursday that car sales jumped 7% in the three months through September after plunging for most of the year as people turned off by his embrace of President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe balked at buying his cars.

But the jump comes with a caveat: Tesla benefited from consumers taking advantage of a $7,500 tax credit before it expired on Sept. 30, a surge in buying that helped all EV makers.

In fact, many Tesla rivals saw sales rise more. Rivian Automotive reported a 32% increase.

Tesla stock rose sharply on the sales news, but closed the day down 4.5% to $439 amid skepticism the new number really signals a turnaround given all the anti-Musk backlash.

“I don’t think most people are any more enamored with Elon now than they were a few months ago,"" said Telemetry Insight's Sam Abuelsamid. ""I expect this is more a blip for Tesla than the restart of growth.”

Even Tesla bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities was cautious, noting there are ""still demand issues.”

Still, it was a blowout number with sales hitting 497,099 vehicles versus 462,890 in the same period last year. Analysts expected a small drop to 456,000.

Investors cheered Musk’s decision in April to leave Washington for Austin, Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. But he is still heavily involved in political and social wars, alienating potential car buyers.

On Wednesday, he posted on X that he was canceling his Netflix subscription because of critical comments made by the creator of a show on the streaming service, which appeared to spark a wave of cancellations in turn.

The sharp fall in Tesla stock Thursday was remarkable as investors have been surprisingly optimistic about the company in recent weeks despite terrible financial figures.

Investors drove the stock up 34% in September alone in a bet that Musk’s planned new cheaper version of his bestselling Model Y will recharge sales. Musk has also been successful in shifting investor attention away from cars to other aspects of the business — the rollout of its driverless robotaxi service planned for several cities and its Optimus robots for factory work and household chores.

Driving the stock higher has also been Musk’s apparent renewed focus on the company.

To hold his attention, Tesla's board proposed last month a pay package that would allow Musk to earn $1 trillion if he meets certain financial goals over the next several years. The pay offer, unprecedented for U.S. companies known for outsized CEO compensation, drew criticism from Pope Leo in an interview lamenting widening income gaps.

If Musk meets the goals, he could set a record on top of his own record. He recently became the first person ever to hit $500 billion in net worth, at least according to rich list compiler Forbes magazine.

The 7% sales rise in the last quarter compares with a 13% dropped in the first three months of the year when Musk led Trump's government cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. In the following three months through June, sales plunged 13% again.

The anti-Musk backlash in Europe had been also been fierce. Sales plunged 40% in more than two dozen countries after he publicly supported far-right politicians there.

Musk said a British prime minister was an ""evil tyrant"" who belongs in prison and told Germans ""things will get very, very much worse"" in their country if they didn't vote for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. Protests broke out in several cities, including a hanging of the billionaire in effigy in Milan and posters in London likening him to a Nazi.

For her part, the Tesla head of the board of directors who approved Musk’s latest pay package recently told Bloomberg that she is not sure if Musk’s politics have had any impact on the company’s finances. Robyn Denholm has earned nearly $700 million in compensation for serving on the board since 2014, a package that itself has drawn criticism.

Tesla reports third-quarter earnings later this month. Profits for the previous quarter fell 16% as the company continued to lose market share to European EV makers and fast-growing Chinese rivals, such as BYD.

Musk's new robotaxi service, which began with a test-run in Austin in June, has had some hitches with reports of the cabs stopping suddenly for no reason and even driving in the opposing lane in one instance. But Musk says the service will quickly roll out anyway with launches in several other cities by the end of next year.

According to Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, the U.S. Department of Energy will axe $8 billion worth of energy projects, including nearly $450 million in federal grants for clean energy and grid improvement projects in Oregon. The Energy Department stated that the grants did not meet the ""economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.""

According to the list, this includes about 19 awards in Oregon, including to recipients such as Portland General Electric, Warm Springs Power Enterprises and Daimler Truck North America.

RELATED: Daimler Truck aims to offer fully carbon-neutral trucks by 2039

Those canceled projects include upgrades to the electric grid, transmission, clean technology manufacturing, energy efficiency, charging infrastructure and workforce development, according to Climate Solutions, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Advocates and officials particularly highlighted the loss of $1 billion in funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub. The Biden administration had announced seven ""hydrogen hubs"" across the U.S. back in 2023, saying that they would help the country move away from fossil fuels and resulting greenhouse gases.

Said hubs were to be made up of local governments, businesses, labor groups and researchers, to help develop, produce and distribute hydrogen fuels in a regional network that included Oregon, Washington state and Montana. The Northwest Hub, according to the Energy Department at the time, would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 25 million metric tons per year — or the equivalent of the emissions of more than five million passenger cars — as well as create over 10,000 jobs.

Hydrogen has been touted as a greener alterative for parts of the economy that are hard to electrify, like heavy industry, trucking, and the manufacture of carbon-intensive materials, like concrete and steel.

""PNWH2 will continue to support our project and industry partners that have laid the foundation for a thriving hydrogen ecosystem throughout the Pacific Northwest,"" said the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, in part. ""With or without federal support, this industry will continue to drive the innovation and infrastructure needed to fortify America’s energy economy.""

Many warned that the cancelations will kneecap revamping of the electric grid amid higher energy needs, and end up costing ratepayers more money.

""Let’s be clear-eyed about the impact of this latest action by the federal government: it hurts our state’s ability to modernize our outdated electric grid and meet today's rising energy demands with affordable clean energy, and Oregon families and businesses will be stuck with paying the tab,"" said Nora Apter, Oregon director of Climate Solutions.

Director Janine Benner of the Oregon Department of Energy called the move ""a significant setback.""

“Between these actions, various supply chain issues, tariffs on components, and federal agencies halting permitting even for projects not on federal lands, the federal government is making choices that may threaten reliability and will certainly increase costs for ratepayers,” Benner stated.

Gov. Tina Kotek, in a statement, said the administration's reversal ""is not shocking,"" calling it ""the latest disappointment in the President’s history of prioritizing political posturing over the future we desperately need to build.""

Washington state officials also condemned the general government's action, saying it terminates more than $1.1 billion from the state's 11 federally funded energy projects across five counties, the grants having already been awarded by Congress.

Washington state Governor Bob Ferguson said that they are working with the attorney general to ""fight this illegal action.""

States that are affected include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

This follows another round of the Trump administration targeting climate programs and clean energy grants; last week, the Department of Energy yanked back $13 billion, authorized by Congress in 2022, intended for clean energy projects.

It is National Drive Electric Month but Oregon drivers who do not own electric vehicles face a setback, as federal tax credits expire Tuesday for buying an EV.

The credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used models are ending early under the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Oregon has a burgeoning EV industry, with one of the highest rates of EV drivers per capita in the country. The bill also scrapped federal fuel economy standards.

Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director for the advocacy group Plug In America, said the credits and standards have been a driving force in the transition away from gasoline vehicles.

“The policy changes that we’re seeing are largely going to undermine industrial progress in the United States,” Malmgren contended. “Particularly in battery manufacturing, clean energy manufacturing and automotive manufacturing.”

Investments in EV manufacturing have created more than 230,000 new jobs across the U.S. so far, according to Plug In America. Opponents of the EV tax credits said they have been costly and ineffective.

Malmgren pointed out more than one in four new vehicles sold around the world is electric, and the number is likely to increase. She argued rolling back clean vehicle standards and incentives puts the U.S. at a disadvantage globally.

“We are not going to be leaders in this space,” Malmgren cautioned. “We are going to lose out on technological innovations and we are going to have to watch the rest of the world move forward and possibly be buying our vehicles from other countries.”

Despite the challenging policy environment, Malmgren believes the shift to EVs is inevitable.

“They’re just superior vehicles,” Malmgren asserted. “They’re quick, they’re clean, they’re quiet. They offer so many benefits over gas vehicles.”

Oregon has also had some state tax credits for buying EVs but the Standard Rebate expired Sept. 8. Lower-income drivers can still apply for what’s known as a “Charge Ahead” rebate.",https://kyaq.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ev_charging.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 02:58:06.993896

Much of that capacity is clustering in Southeast Asia, not in Detroit or Chongqing.
In 2024, the White House raised the tariff rate on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent, with additional hikes on batteries and other inputs.
Brussels raised duties on Chinese EVs in late 2024 and has been haggling ever since over price floors and adjustments.
Southeast Asia is building that base right now.","Last month, BYD loaded 959 Thailand-built electric cars onto a carrier bound for Europe. The shipments left Rayong as Brussels kept tariffs on China-made EVs and explored price-floor talks with Beijing. The message here is simple. Production is moving to where policy and logistics make the maths work, and Southeast Asia is already on the route map.

Tariffs can wall off markets, but they cannot conjure supply chains. The United States can add a 100 per cent duty on Chinese electric vehicles and still find itself short of the parts that actually build cars. Motors roll on bearings. Battery packs need anode material and precision castings. Much of that capacity is clustering in Southeast Asia, not in Detroit or Chongqing. If Washington wants cheaper, faster electrification, it should build origin-cumulation corridors with Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which are basically agreements that let the value added across the participating countries be counted together under rules of origin and verified quickly. This way, the system rewards speed and auditability, not just domestic content targets. The alternative is to pay more and wait longer.

If the goal is resilience, the next step is to secure trusted capacity where it already exists or is scaling fast.

Start with the tariffs. In 2024, the White House raised the tariff rate on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent, with additional hikes on batteries and other inputs. Those measures were justified as a shield against subsidised overcapacity. They do not change the simple arithmetic that US brands still depend on non-Chinese, non-US nodes for key components. If the goal is resilience, the next step is to secure trusted capacity where it already exists or is scaling fast.

Thailand is the obvious anchor. It is the region’s auto hub, now flipping hard into electrification with new Board of Investment programs and a steady run of battery and EV announcements. The BOI’s incentives extend corporate tax holidays and export flexibility that have lured global pack makers (multinational battery firms that assemble cells into modules and packs used in EVs), including a billion-dollar cell plant that cleared approvals in 2025. In March 2025, Thailand formally approved more than US$1 billion of battery-cell investment by China’s Sunwoda, underscoring the scale and speed of the shift. Even after a soft year for output, Thailand is exporting EVs and attracting Japanese and Chinese capital for next-gen lines. This is a base that can supply US assembly lines with audited parts at scale.

Malaysia is the precision shop floor of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Its automotive ecosystem spans metal stamping, die casting, heat treatment, and machining, and it feeds regional vehicle programs with cast housings, hubs, and other high tolerance parts. The same supplier base that outfits vehicle platforms and industrial equipment can qualify bearings and machined components for North American lines, provided documentation is clean and lead times are contractual. Policymakers should recognise that documentation quality is as infrastructure-critical as a bridge.

Indonesia closes the triangle with minerals and mid-stream battery materials. The country now accounts for roughly half of global mined nickel and is adding capacity in anodes and cathode precursors, while large cell projects proceed towards commissioning. A durable US EV strategy needs a pathway to treat these inputs as “friendly” when they are processed and packed within ASEAN, with high-visibility audit trails. The point is not to import more risk, but to import time.

Europe’s own tariff moves underline the reality. Brussels raised duties on Chinese EVs in late 2024 and has been haggling ever since over price floors and adjustments. The message for Washington is clear. Everyone is trying to rebalance, but no one can decarbonise by decree. The winners will be the blocs that replace ideology with logistics.

Here is what to do.

First, negotiate “cumulation corridors” with Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia that allow parts to earn preferential treatment if value is added within the corridor and if suppliers meet digital audit standards. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership already provides a regional rules-of-origin backbone and a customs facilitation chapter. Use that legal plumbing to bolt on US standards for traceability, sample testing, and ruling timelines. Do not wait for an omnibus deal. Start with a corridor memorandum of understanding and publish the product-specific rules and harmonised system codes that qualify.

EVs are systems, not slogans. Systems thrive on uptime.

Second, make speed a policy variable. Set guaranteed determination windows for origin rulings and create a green-lane for certified suppliers so documentation moves at production tempo during tariff churn. That reduces working capital trapped at ports and cuts the hidden consumer tax of delays.

Third, co-fund metrology and failure-analysis labs in Kuala Lumpur, Rayong, and Batam so small-to-medium enterprises can qualify to US auto standards without six-month queues. A dollar spent on paperwork quality can save ten on inventory.

Finally, match incentives to auditability. The United States already ties credits to content. Go further and bonus what can be verified quickly. Require live dashboards for corridor shipments so buyers can see origin, transformation steps, and lab results in one view. Publish monthly stats on ruling times and exceptions. When suppliers know that clean paperwork is a revenue driver, they will build for it.

This is not a plea to offshore the energy transition. It is an admission that EVs are systems, not slogans. Systems thrive on uptime. With Europe tightening, China retaliating, and US automakers still climbing the battery learning curve, the smart bet is to lock in a nearby, non-Chinese, rules-compliant base for the parts that make cars move. Southeast Asia is building that base right now. America should meet it halfway, and quickly.",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/BYD%20shipment%20comp.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 03:58:46.884888

Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association - serving WA, ID, MT, & OR -- loses around $1 billion in federal funding, potentially curtailing billions in private sector clean energy investments & 10k+ jobs throughout region

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2) is one of the projects targeted by the Trump Administration’s short-sighted, partisan funding cuts the White House Office of Management and Budget announced last night. The PNWH2 supports clean energy efforts in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. Its cancellation will eliminate more than 10,000 jobs across the region, mainly in rural areas.

“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt. Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work. I will be fighting to restore these funds,” said U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

The Trump Administration cut funding from the following Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub partner projects located in Washington state:

Alare Renewables (Whatcom County): $102,797,603

Atlas Agro (Benton County): $157,342,270

Northwest Seaport Alliance (King/Pierce Counties): $11,800,670

Lewis County Transit (Lewis County): $36,385,400

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a collective of projects aimed at green hydrogen ecosystem spurring billions of dollars of infrastructure investment to provide alternatives to fossil fuels, has been years development and won a highly competitive national competition to receive the roughly $1 billion federal funding award. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) choose the Pacific Northwest Hub to demonstrate how clean hydrogen generated from hydropower could be utilized by a range of industries and transportation sectors.

In October 2023, the DOE designated PNWH2 as one of seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) across the nation, focused on harnessing the Pacific Northwest’s abundant and clean hydropower supplies to produce hydrogen through hydrolysis.

In July 2024, DOE announced that PNWH2 received Phase 1 award status and would receive an initial amount of up to $27.5 million to fund initial planning, permitting, and analysis activities to ensure that the overall Hub concept is technologically and financially viable, with input from relevant local stakeholders. Besides the $1 billion in federal cost-sharing, the Hub expected to be matched by over $5 billion in local investments.

Sen. Cantwell worked to include the H2Hubs program and other key hydrogen investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) during consideration in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where she served as a senior member, in July 2021, and push for its successful passage through the Senate. Together with the clean hydrogen incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), these investments represent a historical investment that will help spur hydrogen to be an important piece of the decarbonizing puzzle needed to reach our climate goals.

In March 2024, Sen. Cantwell co-led a bipartisan delegation of Washington and Oregon lawmakers voicing their support for PNWH2 in a letter to the DOE.

“Supported by the region’s vast federal and non-federal hydropower resources, the PNWH2 will not only demonstrate our region’s ability to produce, process, deliver, store, and use clean hydrogen, we believe it will serve as a national model of how an integrated clean hydrogen network can facilitate the creation of an affordable and self-sustaining clean hydrogen economy,” the lawmakers wrote.

In July 2024, Sen. Cantwell led her colleagues in a letter to U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging the agency to ease its criteria for hydrogen power development projects that qualify for the Section 45V Credit, which was established by the IRA and reimburses hydrogen power projects by up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced.

“The 45V credit offers the United States an irreplaceable opportunity to boost our economic and international competitiveness. At this critical juncture for the expansion of domestic clean hydrogen production, it is important that Treasury apply a workable tax treatment of new projects to spur investment, attract customers, and promote new clean energy jobs,” the senators wrote. The letter also stated, “Getting it right means capitalizing on this opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster and enhance our energy security, while strengthening our economy, creating thousands of jobs, and combating the climate crisis.”

The H2Hubs program was established by the BIL. It designates up to $7 billion in competitive grants to establish between six and 10 regional clean hydrogen hubs across the United States. These networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure will help accelerate the use of hydrogen as clean energy and work toward achieving the goal of a 100 percent clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/themes/cantwell/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 22:59:20.233939

We would welcome any partnerships with the utility to invest in clean energy options to help keep rates low.
We need to retire these aging coal plants and invest in more affordable, clean energy options for Arkansans to help keep our rates lower.","Coal-powered electricity has long had an impact on American energy systems and our environment. In its latest Dirty Truth report, the Sierra Club pulls back the curtain on the industry, grading U.S. utilities on their climate pledges and calling out greenwashing, as well as flagging slow coal plant retirements and challenging cities and states to demand more accountability.

Ozarks at Large’s Jack Travis reached out to two people deeply immersed in those questions: Emory Hopkins, Sierra Club organizer for Arkansas, and Peter Nierengarten, director of sustainability for the city of Fayetteville. They dig into what the Dirty Truth reveals about Arkansas utilities, what's realistic for cities, and how citizens can push for change.

As far as utilities in the Natural State, Hopkins says they're in a steady decline and possibly overcharging their customers.

Hopkins: SWEPCO we can see is backsliding, and this has been their worst score in the history of the Dirty Truth report. They scored an F. They're investing way too much money in their aging, dirty, polluting Flint Creek Coal Plant, which is located in northwest Arkansas. SWEPCO actually, right now, is asking the Arkansas Public Service Commission for a rate hike, and they want to spend over $30 million to invest in the Flint Creek plant in their current rate case.

They're also planning to build more expensive gas plants, more than 3 gigawatts by 2035, which is a lot of energy, while also investing less in clean, affordable energy than they have in previous years.

The Arkansas Electric Cooperative also scored an F. This is also their worst score in the history of the Dirty Truth report. AECC owns the Flint Creek coal plant with SWEPCO, and this aging, polluting plant has no retirement commitment. They also had one of the lowest renewable scores in the entire United States, earning 0 percent because they had no planned solar or wind while facing future load growth.

And finally, Entergy Arkansas earned a C. The reason why they earned a C rather than a D or an F is largely due to their commitments to retire the costly White Bluff and Independence coal plants, which will remove hundreds of tons of toxic chemicals from the air every year. But the reason why they didn't score higher is because Entergy Arkansas needs to be planning for more renewables moving forward.

Travis: More on Entergy. They're backtracking their 2030 clean energy goals. Could you talk about what message that sends to customers and policymakers?

Hopkins: This is a trend that we're seeing throughout the country. We've seen some of the lowest scores in the Dirty Truth since it was first published. Really, what we're seeing here is that utilities need to be making better choices and plan better for a future with more demand, which includes having a better diversity of resources and access to cleaner, affordable energy rather than relying only on fossil fuels.

We also need to be seeing our utilities investing more in technology like transmission because we need to have access to cleaner energy and more affordable energy in other places, like Oklahoma, which has great access to wind, for example. If Arkansas had access to that energy, it would make everybody's bills more affordable.

Travis: The report warns that some of that poor planning could increase household electricity bills by $120 by the year 2030 and $230 by 2035. Is that already playing out in Arkansas? Are we seeing rate increases?

Hopkins: We're absolutely seeing rate increases. For example, as we were talking about, SWEPCO right now has a docket open with the Public Service Commission where they are asking to increase rates by an average of 27 percent for residential customers. I think that number is a wider range for commercial customers—it's 20 to 40 percent. That's already $30 on normal residential customers’ bills, and we expect to see this trend continue moving forward.

Travis: How would a data center going up in West Memphis affect these results?

Hopkins: We see that throughout the country. Data centers are causing a lot of load growth, and utilities have not done the proper planning to keep up with something like that. A lot of utilities are backsliding on their clean energy commitments. My hope is that we can hold our utilities accountable to keeping their clean energy goals and keeping our bills affordable while big companies invest more in things like data centers.

Travis: How does continued reliance on these coal and new gas plants affect public health in Arkansas, especially for vulnerable lower-income communities?

Hopkins: We often see coal plants, gas plants already in the most marginalized communities, which are communities who are already paying so much of their income toward their electric bill. I don't have all of the stats on hand, but I do know that in 2023 alone, Flint Creek, for example, cost the residents of Arkansas over $13 million in health impacts such as ER visits and asthma attacks, cardiac and neurological diseases, as well as missed days of school and work. And that's just one of the coal plants that resides in Arkansas.

Nierengarten: And I'd just add, Jack, that from a pollution perspective, I think we've known for a long time that coal plants in particular emit dirty pollutants. Those are bad for our health. They're also bad for our environment. But what we're seeing play out today with the SWEPCO rate increase that Emory referenced is they're also bad for our pocketbooks. Continuing to operate these aging, dirty, particularly coal facilities is expensive.

The coal train coming to Arkansas from Wyoming, delivering that coal every single day, is expensive—to mine it out of the ground in Wyoming and ship it all the way to Arkansas and burn it in that coal plant. That has a cost that's much higher than wind and solar and other clean energy options and transmission. And so the economic argument for clean energy is really playing out and really laid bare by this 27 percent rate increase that SWEPCO has proposed.

Travis: With regard to that, if y'all could have the ear of a policymaker or a regulatory commission, what recommendations would either of y'all have if you could have just 15 minutes to really speak your mind?

Nierengarten: The city of Fayetteville has intervened in this rate case that SWEPCO has opened right now, and we've submitted our testimony to the Public Service Commission. Essentially, our arguments are that the economic justification that SWEPCO has used to continue and further the operation of the coal plant is unsound and uses bad math. They discount coal, and they inflate the cost for clean energy—wind and solar and transmission. If you corrected for both of those items, closing the coal plant would be in the best economic interest of Arkansas ratepayers.

Our message to the Arkansas Public Service Commission is disallow the $31 million that SWEPCO is asking for rate recovery on associated with these improvements at the coal plant because it's a bad economic investment for Arkansans, and it's causing our utility bills to go up.

Travis: How much influence or sway does the city of Fayetteville have with the Arkansas Public Service Commission?

Nierengarten: It's a difficult question to answer. We're one of about 10 intervening parties, along with Walmart, the University of Arkansas, the Sierra Club, Audubon, the attorney general's office, and a couple others. We have standing. They've accepted our testimony, and we hope that they are listening. I think our arguments are strong and sound.

If you look at the economic impact of the rate increase, it's over $30 per month for the average Arkansan. If you do the math on what that impact looks like just across Fayetteville alone, it's over $15 million a year in added electricity costs. That's going to be leaving our local economy, in part to support this aging coal plant that again is importing coal from Wyoming to burn and generate dirty electricity for Arkansas.

Travis: Does the city have any tools that can help people reduce their energy burden even when utilities are slow to transition? I know that Fayetteville is kind of a leader in sustainable energy.

Nierengarten: Yeah. We've been investing heavily in clean energy. We've got 10 megawatts of ground-mounted solar at our two wastewater treatment plants. That's helped levelize our electricity costs that we pass on to our ratepayers. That's part of what we're investing in to try to keep our services as low as possible in the city of Fayetteville, as our strategy to help mitigate the impacts of the rate increase.

Travis: Do you see any opportunities for partnerships between cities like Fayetteville and utilities that could accelerate some of that clean energy adoption?

Nierengarten: Yeah, we would certainly welcome any partnerships. That could be especially beneficial beyond us as a large ratepayer, but also for the average ratepayer, the residents and the businesses across the city. We would welcome any partnerships with the utility to invest in clean energy options to help keep rates low.

Travis: What's one action that you would like to see Arkansans—just normal residents—push for, whether through policy, city programs or grassroots advocacy, in response to this Dirty Truth report?

Hopkins: Jack, I love that question. Peter talked about the different people and entities that are intervening in this rate case. But normal Arkansans also have an opportunity to leave public comment and give testimony. I would really encourage everybody listening to go tell the Arkansas Public Service Commission that you don't want your utilities to pass on the costs of dirty coal onto everyday ratepayers and increase rates.

They can do that through—I'm going to shamelessly plug—sc.org/noratehike We have a site to make it easy for people to submit their public comment. There's also going to be an opportunity for public testimony in person in Texarkana on Dec. 2 and Fayetteville Dec. 4.

Nierengarten: We absolutely support folks making their comments heard directly to the Arkansas Public Service Commission. Use the link the Sierra Club has available, show up in person in December at the public hearing. That's your opportunity to talk directly to the Arkansas Public Service Commission and help them understand that we don't want to see continued investment in aging, dirty coal infrastructure that's causing our electricity rates to rise.

The only thing I would add, Jack, is we've known for a long time that coal plants produce dirty pollution. It's bad for our health. It's bad for our environment. And it's also bad for our pocketbooks. I think the current SWEPCO rate increase, the $31 million they want to pass on to ratepayers, that's going to cost the average Arkansan over $30 a month more in electricity rates. That lays bare the fact that the economics of coal is not good. We need to retire these aging coal plants and invest in more affordable, clean energy options for Arkansans to help keep our rates lower.

That was Peter Nierengarten from the city of Fayetteville and Sierra Club's Emory Hopkins speaking with Ozarks at Large’s Jack Travis about the Dirty Truth report.

Jack sought comments from the three Arkansas companies named in the report—SWEPCO, AECC and Entergy—for their input. Only AEC responded in time for our reporting here on Ozarks at Large. AECC manager of corporate communications, Marine Glisovic, stated via email that while the company considers all forms of generation, neither wind nor solar generation resources are capable of providing reliable energy at an affordable cost to serve as replacement generation for its 1.2 million members.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3ef4293/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+13/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Fa7%2F827916424ab5a0022dd7be4abe22%2Fnew-grove-2025-10-02t162511-860.png,N,,2025-10-02 21:59:51.761704

​“Energy does not abide by state boundaries.
Other groundbreaking interregional transmission projects are also facing the ax.
Similar grants awarded to utilities in states that voted for Trump have not been singled out for cancellation.
That includes grid-hardening grants for Gulf Coast utility Entergy ($53.8 million), Michigan utility Consumers Energy ($100 million), and Pennsylvania’s PECO Energy ($100 million).","The Trump administration has declared it will claw back billions of dollars in federal funding that utilities and other recipients are using to strengthen power grids and reduce electricity prices — almost entirely in states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In a Wednesday post on X, Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, declared the administration would cancel ​“nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.” He listed 16 states that would lose project funding — every single one of which voted for Harris last year.

Democrats reacted with fury, saying the Trump administration is abusing its power in an attempt to force Democrats to concede to Republican demands in a congressional budget dispute that has led to the current federal government shutdown.

On Thursday morning, the Department of Energy announced the ​“termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects,” which it claimed would save American taxpayers $7.56 billion. The DOE has not disclosed which grants or projects it has targeted for termination. The agency did not respond to Canary Media’s requests for comment.

“Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states was nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, the New Mexico Democrat who serves as ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in a statement. ​“These are projects that Congress already approved and funded — projects that create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward.”

Two separate sources have provided Canary Media with a list of the 321 grants being targeted by the DOE. The vast majority are indeed in blue states.

The DOE stated that the terminated projects ​“did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” But the partisan breakdown of cancellations appears to belie that statement.

The list includes 26 grants issued by the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (GDO) under a program created by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law to expand the country’s struggling transmission network, harden the grid against extreme weather, build microgrids to protect vulnerable communities during power outages, and deploy technologies to integrate solar, wind, EVs, and batteries into the grid.

The 26 GDO grants slated for cancellation are exclusively in the states that Vought singled out in his Wednesday X post: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.

Meanwhile, the DOE’s termination list does not include dozens more GDO grants issued in 2023, August 2024, and October 2024 for utility projects in states that voted for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Many of those projects are strikingly similar to the ones marked for cancellation in blue states.

“This will result in lost jobs, stranded investments, increasing energy prices — all the things the administration says out of the other side of their mouth that they’re working against,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.

“Even on their own terms — ​‘We’re going to damage those Democrats in the blue states!’ — they’re full of shit,” he added. ​“Energy does not abide by state boundaries. Electrons flow, supply chains flow, markets are often regional or national in nature. Anytime you destroy a project in one part of the country, it’s going to affect another part of the country.”

Some of the GDO grants set for termination are helping to finance core transmission grid infrastructure projects that will span red and blue states alike.

For example, in 2023 the Minnesota Department of Commerce, which is named on the DOE’s list, was awarded a $464 million grant to be backed by $1.3 billion from members of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, two grid operators spanning nearly a dozen Midwestern states. Those combined funds were meant to help finance a set of new transmission lines that will connect the grids between the two regions.

Lack of transmission capacity has driven up power prices across the Midwest and stymied development of lower-cost wind and solar projects that could reduce utility bills. The DOE previously estimated that the transmission built through this initiative could enable an additional 35 gigawatts of clean energy to be brought onto the grid by 2030.

Other groundbreaking interregional transmission projects are also facing the ax. Allete, a Minnesota-based utility on the DOE’s termination list, is a co-recipient of a $700 million grant meant to spur development of the North Plains Connector project, a high-voltage direct-current interconnection across Montana and North Dakota. The partners in the consortium, which include the Montana Department of Commerce, the Colstrip Transmission System, and grid developer Grid United, plan to invest $2.9 billion in matching funds.

Other grants targeted for termination are more state-specific. For example, in Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs and utility Portland General Electric were awarded $250 million to upgrade transmission grid capacity to connect clean energy projects in the eastern part of the state with the state’s urban centers west of the Cascade Mountains.

The California Energy Commission, also on the list, last year received a $600 million federal grant to upgrade 100 miles of electric transmission lines with high-tech power cables that are lighter, stronger, and able to carry more electricity than traditional ones.

Several grants intended to improve grid resilience by adding more clean energy are also slated for cancellation. Maryland utility Baltimore Gas & Electric, Illinois utility Commonwealth Edison, California utility Sacramento Municipal Utility District, and National Grid in New York and Massachusetts were awarded $50 million apiece to help integrate rooftop solar, backup batteries, and other distributed energy resources into their grids.

The list also targets investments in microgrids — combinations of on-site generation, solar, batteries, and power-control systems that serve critical facilities like hospitals and emergency centers. California’s Redwood Coast Energy Authority was awarded $88 million for a project that will finance the development of microgrids on the lands of Northern California’s Hoopa Valley, Yurok, Karuk, and Blue Lake Rancheria tribes. New Mexico’s Kit Carson Electric Cooperative won a $15.4 million grant to build a battery resiliency project. And the Jamestown Board of Public Utilities in New York received a $17 million grant for a community microgrid project.

The DOE had previously determined that these co-investments from the federal government were important for bolstering grid reliability in the face of increasingly extreme weather.

Similar grants awarded to utilities in states that voted for Trump have not been singled out for cancellation. That includes grid-hardening grants for Gulf Coast utility Entergy ($53.8 million), Michigan utility Consumers Energy ($100 million), and Pennsylvania’s PECO Energy ($100 million). Also spared were grants for resiliency projects such as $249 million to deploy microgrids across Louisiana, and grid-enhancing technology deployments such as a $160 million grant for utility Georgia Power to deploy advanced power cables and ​“dynamic line rating” technologies to expand the capacity of its transmission network.

It’s unclear how and when the threatened cuts will take effect, Walsh said. The ongoing government shutdown has scrambled communications with the DOE officials in charge of managing the grants set for termination. Grantees have the right to challenge the terminations with the DOE and in court.

“I hope a lot of them avail themselves of that,” he said. ​“The Trump administration is doing this stuff even when they don’t necessarily believe they can win in the courts. Part of the strategy is to make this so difficult that project developers or investors just walk away because the administration has elevated the risk to an unacceptable level.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2223415726-copy.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a441855e6356a8a8c741f9f5f25397aa,N,,2025-10-02 22:59:37.332821

DEEP Will Hold Webinar on DCRF and This Next Round of Funding October 3.

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) is pleased to announce a call for applications and a draft Request for Proposals under an expanded DEEP Climate Resilience Fund. DEEP is making available up to $33 million in state funds and up to $11.8 million in federal funds for projects that protect communities and critical infrastructure from extreme weather. This opportunity is open to municipalities, non-profit organizations, and other entities, and includes new funding categories that will support a wide range of community and energy resilience projects.

In recent years, Connecticut has experienced widespread impacts from extreme weather, including historic flooding in the Naugatuck Valley, unprecedented wildfires, and the hottest summer weather on record. These climate-driven hazards have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to homes, roads, bridges, and businesses. Connecticut’s communities have endured these recent challenges from extreme weather just as federal support for resilience is becoming less certain.

DEEP is releasing the next round of the Climate Resilience Fund to assist communities navigating these changes to the federal funding landscape and continue developing projects that make Connecticut more resilient. Leveraging the expertise of staff across DEEP’s environmental as well as energy programs, DEEP’s “one-stop shop” is ready to assist communities as they pursue resilience planning and project implementation and assess what federal support might be available to them to maximize their dollars.

“The 2025 DEEP Climate Resilience Fund builds on DEEP’s strong track record of investing in community resilience, from microgrids to flood mitigation projects, with a comprehensive approach that includes energy resilience and nature-based solutions,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “With climate change accelerating and traditional federal financial support uncertain, it’s more important than ever to help municipalities access every possible option for matching funds for resilience projects. The DCRF’s ‘single-front’ door approach is intended to do just that, making it easier for municipalities to seek project deployment funds for projects that will protect communities from floods, heat waves, power outages, and other extreme weather events.”

The DCRF Notice of Funding Opportunity and draft Request for Proposals include funding categories intended to help build a pipeline of successful resilience projects statewide. DCRF will support resilience planning to help communities identify risks and potential solutions, and project advancement to fund the design work needed to transform plans into projects. DCRF also includes a new category for project deployment that will provide direct and matching funds for construction of community and energy resilience projects, expanding upon DEEP’s prior Microgrid Grant and Loan Program. Through this new deployment funding category, DEEP anticipates providing support for measures as diverse as flood control projects, climate-smart improvements to energy infrastructure and other community lifelines, wildfire prevention strategies, nature-based solutions for cooling urban centers, energy resilience measures, and other innovative resilience projects.

“We are pleased to continue our partnership with DEEP to help communities reduce the risk of disasters and rebuild with resilience,” DEMHS Deputy Commissioner Brenda Bergeron said. “We look forward to encouraging communities who need matching funds for federal grants to apply to DEEP’s new matching funds program, which will help communities better navigate the current uncertainty in the federal funding landscape and successfully compete for funding.”

Previous DCRF-funded projects:

In 2023, DEEP awarded $8.8 million in planning and advancement grants through the inaugural round of the DEEP Climate Resilience Fund. These awards supported 21 innovative climate resilience plans and projects across 17 Connecticut municipalities and Councils of Government, including:

$250,000 to the City of Bridgeport to conduct a comprehensive climate risk and vulnerability assessment, and develop a prioritized list of strategies, actions, and projects.

$689,181 to the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments to develop and advance culvert replacement and drainage system improvement projects in nine municipalities to reduce stormwater flooding.

$506,000 to the Greater New Haven Water Pollution Control Authority to conduct studies on street flooding and sewer back-ups in the Westville neighborhood, and identify and evaluate options for potential projects that include nature-based solutions.

$250,000 to the Capitol Region Council of Governments to work with municipalities in the CRCOG region to conduct stormwater authority feasibility assessments.

Previous Microgrid Grant and Loan Program projects:

Since 2013, DEEP has awarded more than $22 million to 10 operational microgrids across the state. These projects support critical facilities like police stations, fire stations, municipal buildings, and hospitals during power outages. The new, comprehensive DCRF program will be open to microgrids as well as other energy resilience projects.

This current round of the DEEP Climate Resilience Fund is open to municipal governments, local public utilities, non-profit organizations, state and federally recognized Tribal nations, and other entities. Additional details on eligibility, funding categories, program priorities, and how to apply can be found in the Notice of Funding Opportunity and draft Request for Proposals.

DEEP will be holding a webinar to provide an overview of this funding opportunity on October 3, 2025, at 10 a.m. as part of Governor Lamont’s Sustainability and Resilience Week. Go here to register for the webinar: Webinar Registration - Zoom

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

Federal Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 18 other Democratic attorneys general who sued the U.S. Department of Energy and its leader, Chris Wright, in August over attempts to cut funding for such projects. Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal energy department.

Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench and no written order has yet been filed with the court.

States argued that a new federal energy department rule mandating that “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — cannot exceed 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations. Officials from the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.

The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.

Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.

“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”

Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.

Rayfield was joined in the latest suit by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as Kentucky Gov.

We should use this time to unite against Fascists, Dictators and those that use their power to forcefully control others. It’s the 4th Turn so please remain calm and stay strong.

The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money ""to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled.""

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican's short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — ""favorite projects, and they'd be permanently cut.""

""I'm allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,"" Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump's comments show that he and Vought are treating American ""families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

""This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people's energy bills,"" she said in a statement. ""This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state's hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project ""vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.""

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden's agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's cancellations deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE's termination decision.

The elimination of nearly $8 billion in funding for more than 200 projects could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs that would have been created by the projects, and undercut the Trump administration's own stated goals of boosting American manufacturing competitiveness, critics said.

The cuts were announced on Wednesday, the first day of the federal government shutdown. Earlier Wednesday, the Trump administration froze a whopping $18 billion in funding for two massive infrastructure projects in New York City — the home of Congress's two top Democrats.

President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday, referring to the Energy Department's funding cancellations, said, ""Instead of playing politics with the shutdown, President Trump should be working on bipartisan solutions to lower Americans' costs and create jobs.""

""This goes beyond targeting blue states. It's taking a wrecking ball to working families' lives: putting construction workers out of a job and raising families' electric bills for political gain,"" Schumer said.

While some of the department's cancellations first announced by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought were new, others had been previously announced in May by the department.

Vought likewise trumpeted the funding freeze for a project to build a new rail tunnel connecting New Jersey to New York under the Hudson River, and to extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, before the Department of Transportation formally announced the move.

""That hub will create a clean hydrogen economy across our region,"" Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement to CNBC.

""It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,"" Ferguson said. ""We're working with the Attorney General's Office to fight this illegal action.""

Chris Green, president of the Pacific Hydrogen Association, called the cancellation of federal funds for the hub ""a gut punch.""

""We are, of course, very disappointed in that,"" Green told CNBC, noting that the project could have led to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of jobs.

He said that companies involved in the hub ""were spending lots of their own money,"" with about 80% of the committed funds being provided by private companies, with federal funds providing the remaining 20% or so of the costs.

""Can we still do this project now that we've lost 20% of our planned revenue?"" Green asked. ""It remains to be seen if some of these projects can persevere.""

The Colorado Energy Office said that more than 30 grants totalling more than $500 million ""are being illegally terminated in Colorado alone.

Two of those grants each provide $2.5 million to support reduced energy use and create cost savings through building energy codes and building performance standards through decarbonization, the office said.

""Other terminated grants in Colorado range from oil and gas methane reduction projects and investments in grid resilience to support for utility programs in low-income communities,"" the office said.

""This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the Administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution, and create instability in our business community,"" the office said.

In New Mexico, 10 projects had more than $135 million of Energy Department funding cancelled.

Four of them were under the auspices of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, including one with $42.7 million from the Energy Department to ""develop a storage hub at a commercial scale within San Juan basin to verify these sites can securely store 50 million tons of CO2,"" according to the office of Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.

Heinrich, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Thursday, ""Minutes before the news of these cancelled projects broke, I had just left lunch with [Energy] Secretary [Chris] Wright and he had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included ten projects in my state — projects that affect real jobs and real families.""

""That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions,"" Heinrich said in a statement.

""The American people deserve a government that works for them, not one that plays politics with their lives,"" he said. This Administration is choosing to punish ordinary families just to settle scores — and that is as dangerous as it is un-American.""

The Energy Department, in a statement, said that the cancellations followed "" a thorough, individualized financial review,"" which ""determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.""

Energy Secretary Wright said that many of the awards were ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.""

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,"" Write said, adding that the cancellations ""deliver on that commitment.""

The department said that of the 321 financial awards terminated, ""26% were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day,"" with those awards alone valued at more than $3.1 billion.

But Wells, the NRDC advocate, said that despite the Energy Department's claims, ""there's been a confusing lack of transparency in this process of cancelling"" funding.

Wells contrasted that to the Biden administration's vetting of the projects before they were approved. He noted that the department itself had not publicly released a list of the cancelled projects.

The Energy Department did not respond to CNBC's request for that list.

Wells pointed out that several Democratic members of Congress, including New Mexico's Heinrich, in early September had raised concerns about the influence of political appointees in the Energy Department to cancel funding of projects in May.

""This is highly unusual and counter to longstanding DOE precedent,"" Heinrich and two other Democrats, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, and New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., wrote in a letter to Wright. ""It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards.""

""These programs are not optional,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress. You have no legal authority to sabotage them.""

Ken Lovett, the senior communications advisor on energy and environment for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, said that the funding cuts ""come as no surprise given the Trump administration's full-on assault on clean energy.""

""Whether it's blocking offshore wind, cutting federal incentives for electric vehicles and solar energy, or rolling back clean air and clean water standards, the Trump administration's attempt to rollback the progress we have made puts New Yorkers' well-being and safety at risk,"" Lovett said in a statement.

""We will not go back.""

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

A Maryland utility is touting a project that allows owners of Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickups to send power from their vehicles to the grid and get compensated for it.

The Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. project is a partnership with Ford, the automaker, and Sunrun, a solar and energy services company. It’s the kind of thing that, if deployed on a large scale, could be transformative for the grid.

But the nagging sense I get when reading about vehicle-to-grid pilot projects is that this is an opportunity that remains largely untapped. The Maryland project, for example, involves just three trucks.

Electric vehicles use the large majority of the lithium-ion batteries being produced in today’s market. When those EV batteries are sitting in garages and connected to chargers, they become a potentially vast resource that can be utilized by the grid, generating income for the vehicles’ owners. But to realize this opportunity, utilities, automakers and regulators need to move beyond pilot projects.

Also, the market share for EVs needs to continue to grow, and the Trump administration’s cancellation of the tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying a new EV is a setback. The tax credit ended this week, and analysts expect it will lead to a decrease in EV sales at least in the short term.

I spoke with Willett Kempton, a University of Delaware professor who first wrote about the potential of vehicle-to-grid power in 1997. That paper, co-authored with Steven E. Letendre, who was then at Green Mountain College in Vermont, had a central idea that seemed almost like science fiction at the time, when EVs barely existed. The paper’s title sums it up: “Electric vehicles as a new power source for electric utilities.”

One of its key points was that the technology for using EVs to power the grid was pretty simple. Consumers would need to have bi-directional chargers, capable of sending electricity from the grid to the battery, and from the battery to the grid. And grid managers would need software to control the flow of electricity to the grid.

Kempton found that groups of EVs could send power to the grid and receive compensation that would help to offset the costs of owning the vehicle. There would be almost no negative effect on battery life or the vehicle’s readiness for use.

“The economics are really compelling,” he said.

Here’s some of the math he found exciting: If the United States could get to the point that one-fourth of its vehicles were EVs with bi-directional chargers, they would provide the grid with access to 660 gigawatts of capacity. That figure, from a 2005 paper he co-authored, was close to the total capacity of all U.S. power plants at that time. Since then, other researchers have conducted their own versions of this calculation using more recent variables, underscoring the vast potential.

The main stumbling block turned out to be the reluctance of various stakeholders to agree on technical standards so that they would all be speaking the equivalent of the same language regarding how the system controls would work.

Only recently, decades after that 1997 paper, are companies involved in vehicle-to-grid technology beginning to adopt common charging standards. Now that the standards are coming into place, automakers and utilities have a much easier time setting up vehicle-to-grid programs than they would have before.

Progress is now happening with the development of laws and rules in the states and with pilot projects by companies such as Nuvve of San Diego, a leading player in vehicle-to-grid technology.

Nuvve’s U.S. projects include managing power from a fleet of electric buses in the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area.

At least eight states have recently enacted or introduced legislation or regulatory actions to foster vehicle-to-grid technology, according to the NC Clean Energy Technology Center. They are: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Delaware has been at the forefront, including the work of Kempton and his colleagues at the University of Delaware. Researchers there, sometimes in partnership with the utility Delmarva Power, have used vehicles from Nissan, BMW and other makers as part of various pilot projects.

One recurring theme across the states is that electric buses and fleet vehicles are a common early step for vehicle-to-grid technology because the batteries are large and they are often parked in a central location, making them easier to manage.

What I don’t see anywhere are projects with hundreds or thousands of residential EVs. In this way, vehicle-to-grid initiatives are not as far along as some of the efforts involving home battery systems used in virtual power plants, which are groups of batteries that work together to function like a power plant. Sunrun is a key player in virtual power plants and it has several vehicle-to-grid projects, including the one in Maryland.

Sunrun describes the Maryland initiative as the first in the country to use residential vehicles, as opposed to commercial or fleet vehicles. Last week, it announced that the vehicles had successfully sent power to the grid, after about a year of setting up systems to allow this to happen.

“In addition to showing how electric vehicles can power homes, add electrons to the grid, and help utilities meet peak electricity demand, this program also creates extra income opportunities for customers,” said Sunrun CEO Mary Powell in a statement.

Beginning in July, the utility had the ability to use power from the trucks during the peak demand hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays. The vehicles’ owners get paid based on the amount of electricity they share, which caps at $1,000 for a period that ran from July to September, Sunrun said.

Sunrun has been working with Ford to develop programs such as the one in Baltimore. The long-term goal is to make it commonplace for an EV owner to be able to use their vehicle’s battery for backup power at home or as an income source by selling power to the grid.

Some of the most significant developments in vehicle-to-grid technology are happening in Europe. BMW announced a program last month in Germany where consumers could receive essentially free charging at home in exchange for allowing their battery to provide power to the grid when it’s connected to a charger.

In 1997, Kempton expected that this technology would be much further along than it is today.

“I thought the world was going to beat a path,” he said.

But he is optimistic that today’s pilot projects indicate a market on the cusp of something big. He notes that most of the new EVs coming onto the market have built-in capability for bi-directional charging, and many utilities are in some phase of integrating this into their grid management.

So, let’s see a utility do a vehicle-to-grid project with hundreds or even thousands of vehicles. And let’s see it soon.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/car-8301630_1920.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 21:01:54.085968

As India sits on the cusp of launching its own carbon markets via the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) for the first time, the industry looks keenly to the list of activities that would be eligible to produce carbon credits.

In a cap-and-trade system such as the one India is constructing its carbon market upon, ideally activities undertaken by the obligated entities to reduce their footprints should be generating carbon credits.

But after a public outcry and expert inputs, it has since also been decided to include a ""voluntary"" offset market in the CCTS, which would ease the burden on the obligated entities to directly reduce their emissions. This move makes logical sense, as the industries currently mandated to reduce their carbon footprint under the CCTS are ones like cement, oil and gas, and aluminium, which can only reduce their emissions directly to a certain point.

While it may not be an obvious problem in the first few cycles, without having an alternative offset market in the long term sets the CCTS to fail to meet its objectives. Either due to the targets being scientifically impossible to meet or the deliberate reduction in the quantum of reductions required so as to continue the scheme.

Necessity of offsets

Therefore, offset markets are necessary for the health and sustainability of the compliance part of the Indian Carbon Market. While currently these offsets are left to be voluntary in nature, if one is to learn from the models developed by countries like Singapore and South Korea, there would eventually be a mandated component of 5-10% required to be purchased through the offset markets.

However, in all of this jargon and thick layers of policy, one very important opportunity remains missing — which is Indian biofuels, especially the first-generation (1G) ethanol — something that India is producing in abundance but not really cashing upon its whole gamut of benefits vis-à-vis its environmental impact.

Challenges

The BM 001 methodology that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency government agency has released for public review as part of the ""offset"" scheme does mention biofuel. But as it is a replica of the Clean Development Mechanism methodology on the subject, it presently requires dedicated plantations set up for biofuel production for it to be eligible to produce carbon credits —something that is practically impossible to do in India.

When viewed juxtaposed to the Essential Commodities Act, especially in the case of maize and sugarcane, it might even border on being illegal.

While this initial concern may be addressed in forthcoming drafts of these methodologies, other constraints present in it — while allowing next-generation biofuels like second-generation (2G) ethanol — still render carbon credits for 1G ethanol practically impossible.

Missed opportunity

This should be viewed by our policymakers as a missed opportunity for the country, as we have outperformed our own expectations by achieving 20% blending five years before schedule and are most likely to go ahead on increasing the base blend or allowing for flex-fuel blending with 100% ethanol dispensation, as is already available on 400-odd Indian pumps.

While so far the development of the ethanol programme has been driven by its ability to replace foreign imports, increase energy security, and augment farmer incomes, the environmental impact of this gargantuan measure is mostly qualitatively assessed and not truly capitalised upon.

This becomes more relevant when we consider how going above a 20% blend without any price differentiation between gasoline and ethanol would be a big blow to consumers, with data suggesting an almost 30% loss in efficiency (mileage) when extended up to 100% ethanol blend.

Given that the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) already face stiff price competition from gasoline prices for ethanol, it is still more difficult for the supply side to create this price parity without some additional scheme or support being provided.

Win-Win-Win

Carbon credits come as a natural 'win-win-win' solution for all of these issues. It has already been quantified under various research and policy papers that 1.2-1.5 tonnes of CO2 is saved by mixing every one kilolitre of ethanol with gasoline due to the same amount of fossil fuel use avoided.

Extrapolating this, India has saved more than 50 million tonnes of CO2 emissions so far and would soon cross even 100 million tonnes in the next two years.

A robust carbon accounting and crediting mechanism would drastically feed into India's Nationally Determined Contribution goals and affect it up to as much as 5-7% — an opportunity we have so far missed.

Now the question remains: how would such a scheme work within the existing framework of Indian the CCTS? And the easy answer is: it will not.

When we look at global precedents where carbon-based credits are given for 1G ethanol production, like in Brazil and the US, it is a dedicated scheme addressing this singular issue.

Learning from global precedents

While the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 in the US gives tax credits based on carbon reductions, Brazil's RenovaBio policy mandates the OMCs to buy these credits from the ethanol producers, and these credits are traded in open markets with the ethanol producers competing to make their product as carbon negative as possible in order to fetch a higher value for their produce.

While this policy is now being extended to other biofuels like CBG and SAF, the very existence of this act makes Brazil aim for achieving a negative footprint for their ethanol, which presently remains at 22gm CO2/MJ.

An important point to note here is that Indian ethanol, due to differences in fertilizer use and the prominence of manual harvesting, is 30-40% less carbon intensive —and this difference really starts showing when we are not able to capitalize in our SAF production, where every gram of CO2 fetches a premium price from the fuel markets.

As a result of RenovaBio, Brazil's framework has also been easily integrated within Corsia's list of carbon intensity for SAF from various feedstocks in various countries, while an Indian number remains woefully missing — causing another missed opportunity for Indian farmers.

Recommendations

So, looking at global examples, India must also mandate the OMCs to claim these credits as carbon reductions instead of carbon neutrality by purchasing them from ethanol producers.

This would: create a transparent framework to achieve their own publicly declared net-zero targets, upon which several critical international investments are hinged; and promote low-carbon production of ethanol and climate-resilient farming in India, which would have cascading benefits of its own.

Now, how this fits into the CCTS is for the policymakers to decide. Either OMCs can get a special exemption from meeting their mandatory targets if they purchase these ethanol carbon credits, or these credits are allowed to be claimed for mandatory reductions in the entire cap-and-trade system as a special category.

Given that the volume of these credits will be in millions, the latter choice might negatively impact the prices of other credits in the cap-and-trade system, and therefore the former seems to be a better choice. Keeping OMCs exempt from CCTS and having a specialised ""BharatBio"" scheme for Indian biofuels is also another way to go.

Conclusion: Seizing the immense gains

What is sure is the many gains that India can have — not just for NDCs but for future internationally traded biofuels, like SAF — are immense, so there is enough incentive to make it work even if the answers are not easily visible.",https://www.qcintel.com/i/qci_logo_sq_300x300.png,N,,2025-10-02 20:01:40.613971

U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Sammamish, said in a statement she would do “all I can to reverse this decision.”

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release that the canceled grants deliver on Trump’s promise to protect taxpayer dollars and expand the country’s supply of affordable and reliable energy.

According to DelBene’s office, the cuts include over 200 projects, totaling $7.56 billion nationwide, including $142 million in grants for 10 other projects than the hydrogen hubs in Washington.

Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said the state’s cuts add up to $308 million and would cost 10,000 jobs.

The Department of Energy said that following a “thorough, individualized financial review,” these projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs” and do not “justify continued investment.”

In 2023, the Department of Energy said it would contribute $1 billion to establish a handful of green hydrogen production sites across Washington, Oregon and Montana. That money would be added to supplement around $5 billion to $6 billion in private funding and eventually be used in agriculture and heavy-duty industry and transportation.

Hydrogen is a colorless, flammable gas that does not emit carbon or other greenhouse gases when combusted. Currently, it is used for producing fertilizer and refining petroleum, though advocates of the technology say it could be used to replace natural gas to heat buildings or power long-haul trucks or ships through hydrogen fuel cells, among other uses.

The funding cuts had been long anticipated since Trump took office. In April, 16 Washington Republican lawmakers submitted a letter to Wright urging the continued funding for the Pacific Northwest hydrogen hub.

Other canceled grants in Washington were awarded to Nippon Dynawave Packaging, Paccar, CleanFiber, Washington State University, Spokane Edo LLC and Silfab Solar, according to DelBene’s office. The awards were issued by DOE’s office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.

President of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, Chris Green, said the termination of funding was a disappointing setback.

“It is a pretty big gut punch for all these companies that have been working so hard on this, including bringing their dollars in from all over the world to make these projects happen,” he said.

Green said the organization received the termination notice from the Department of Energy Wednesday evening.

Since the award was announced in 2023, Green said construction has not begun and the organization had been working through permits, design and engineering studies and negotiating contracts.

There is still “significant demand” for hydrogen in the Pacific Northwest and some companies have already indicated they still want to try to move forward, he said. However, it’s too early to know how all the projects will be impacted without the federal funding, Green said.

Planned project sites include Bellingham, Richland and Chehalis in Washington, Port of Morrow and Baker City in Oregon and St. Regis, Montana.

Hydrogen is used for refining petroleum, treating metals, producing fertilizer and processing foods, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nearly all of that hydrogen is called “grey,” meaning it is made with natural gas.

“Green” hydrogen is made by splitting water through an energy-intensive process called electrolysis. Advocates of the burgeoning technology say green hydrogen could clean up hard to decarbonize industries like aviation, maritime shipping and heavy duty manufacturing. However, skeptics of the technology have pointed to the massive amounts of electricity and money it would take to produce green hydrogen at scale.

In 2023, seven hydrogen hubs were announced across the U.S., from California to North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Texas and the mid-Atlantic.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10022025_tzr_tzr_145512.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-10-02 21:00:54.025304

The effort to rescind the Solar for All program will likely bring additional legal challenges against the EPA.","The Biden EPA stated that the program would save households approximately $400 per year in electricity bills. But Republican-led states such as Louisiana, Tennessee, and Utah have since announced they are ending their own Solar for All programs in response to the EPA’s decision to rescind the funds. The program’s grantees, including state governments, have an option to dispute the EPA’s move to repeal the Solar for All funds 30 days after receiving the termination letter.

Louisiana’s energy and natural resources department, which ended its program in early August, told the Washington Examiner via email: “The EPA gave notice that the federal program was being terminated, and our Office of Energy wound the state program down accordingly. The final work plan for carrying out the program had not yet been approved by the EPA, so there was not any significant project work to be impacted.”

Gov. Jeff Landry (R-LA) criticized the state’s “Solar for Y’all” initiative on social media, following the EPA’s effort to rescind its funding.

“The only thing that’s driven your electricity bills through the roof is the Democrat Party. Period. End of story,” Landry wrote on X in August.

“From Obama’s unconstitutional Clean Power Plan… to the fantasyland Green New Deal… to Biden’s $156 million Louisiana ‘Solar for All’ giveaway – every single one of these schemes bleeds taxpayers dry, drives up rates, and leaves our grid weaker than ever,” Landry said. He added that these types of policies and programs have driven up electricity costs.

Louisiana had previously been open to using the funds. In 2024, Tyler Gray, Landry’s secretary of the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, said the state is “uniquely positioned to benefit” from the program, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.

Meanwhile, Democratic-led California has called the EPA’s move to terminate funding “unlawful” and said it is underway in implementing its Solar for All grants.

“Congress appropriated these funds with a clear mandate. Revoking them now undermines our legal system and destabilizes ongoing projects,” California’s Energy Commission said in August. It added that the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, and Labor and Workforce Development Agency “urge the EPA to reverse its unlawful termination.”

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, repealed unobligated funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Utah’s Office of Energy Development cited the megatax bill as the reason for ending its own Solar for All program.

“The EPA ended the program in response to the repeal of Section 134 of the Clean Air Act by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” it said in a statement. “Although Utah remains committed to its any-of-the-above energy approach, the Utah Office of Energy Development is unable to move forward with its Solar for All program.”

Zealan Hoover, a former senior adviser at the EPA, previously told the Washington Examiner that the Solar for All program is designed to help nearly 1 million low- and middle-income families save on their electricity bills by installing solar panels and storage systems on rooftops or through nearby community solar facilities.

The program’s termination “takes four gigawatts of energy off the table at a moment when we have serious concerns about our ability to meet rising demand from [artificial intelligence] and other industries,” said Hoover, who also works as an independent adviser to the Environmental Protection Network.

“It is one of the last remaining pressure relief valves for families that are grappling with rapidly increasing electricity prices,” he added.

The latest Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that electricity prices increased by 6.2% for the year ending in August — more than twice the overall inflation rate of 2.9%.

CLIMATE GROUPS SEEK FULL COURT REHEARING OVER $20 BILLION GRANT CUTS

The EPA’s decision is part of a broader effort to dismantle programs funded by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The agency is currently engaged in a legal battle as it seeks to cancel funding for other initiatives under the program, including the National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator.

The EPA has claimed that under the Biden administration, funds were being disbursed rapidly with limited oversight before the Trump administration took office. The effort to rescind the Solar for All program will likely bring additional legal challenges against the EPA.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25260752779027.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-03 00:59:11.482520

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want, “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called the cancellation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects, from West Virginia to Washington state, selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart the development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, another environmental group, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

The Trump move doesn’t affect a popular state program known as Illinois Shines, which provides incentives and has no income eligibility requirements.","Gerald Jones used to pay hundreds of dollars a month for gas and electric service to his Chatham home.

With 23 solar panels installed on his South Side bungalow last year, he now pays as low as $75 a month.

That savings is also the result of better home insulation and a switch to electric heat, eliminating the need for natural gas that contributes to climate change.

But the solar panels, funded with the help of a state program called Solar for All, are the game changer, he said.

“I tell everybody: Get it,” said Jones, a retired mail carrier. “You can save money and the environment.”

State officials were counting on more than $130 million in federal funding to expand rooftop solar and related programs for low-income residents, a plan that would help more people like Jones.

But President Donald Trump pulled that funding.

The federal money was going to significantly expand the program, in place since 2019.

For now, a relatively small number of customers have taken part in the state program — just over 2,700. But state officials and program advocates hoped to change that trend at a time when electric bills are soaring for Illinois residents.

“This program was all about saving people money on their electricity bills, particularly people and communities that haven’t seen the benefits of solar, which is the cheapest way and quickest way to get electricity built,” said Adam Kent, an expert with the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council.

Kent’s organization did an analysis showing Trump withheld more than $9 billion in promised money across the country for various programs intended to fight climate change.

The money for Illinois was canceled illegally, according to Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration. Under Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency said Congress recently gave it the power to end the promised money, setting up what’s likely to be a drawn-out dispute.

The termination of the funding “lacks any legal basis,” and “will cause irreparable harm to Illinoisans,” Pritzker’s administration wrote to the EPA last month.

Illinois electric utilities ComEd and Ameren offer tens of millions of dollars each year for solar subsidies, which are funded by charges on customers’ monthly power bills. The utilities will continue to provide money each year for rooftop solar assistance in Illinois, but state dollars may run out by the middle of next year.

The Trump move doesn’t affect a popular state program known as Illinois Shines, which provides incentives and has no income eligibility requirements. That program includes plans that allow people to earn credits on their utility bills by paying a monthly fee to support solar farms.

The expansion of rooftop panels through Solar for All helps all electric customers, according to ComEd.

The hottest days of summer stress the electric grid and drive up the price of electricity. So when people can produce their own power, it’s a savings for all customers, said Scott Vogt, ComEd’s vice president of strategy, energy policy and revenue initiatives.

In Illinois, Solar for All is intended to also help the state meet goals for clean energy and mitigate the impact of climate change.

It’s a pitch that appealed to Tekeyra Moore of Chicago Heights, who also participated in the program.

Moore said she worried about the health threats posed by natural gas. So she also cut off gas in addition to adding solar panels.

She said she definitely doesn’t miss gas bills that would rise above $200 a month during the winter. Her monthly bills are “now not even half” what they used to be, she said. “It’s a big savings.”

While Jones is pleased that he’s doing his part to help save the planet from climate change, he admits saving money while on a fixed income is an even bigger incentive.

“The main thing is saving me first,” he said.

Jones, who retired from the U.S. Postal Service 12 years ago, lives in the home his parents bought 70 years ago when it was newly built. He worked with Elevate Energy, the state’s program administrator, and ComEd to install the panels.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,’' said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace’’ for innovative energy technologies, he said.

If we want sustainable growth in Northwest Indiana, we must treat housing and placemaking as the building blocks of “real” economic development. Together, they turn addresses into neighborhoods and projects into places where people live, work and gather.

The Region’s current path makes the case plain: our market is tight, our communities are shifting, and our competitiveness hinges on how we align housing production with place-quality investments.

Clear market signals

In spring 2024, sellers in Northwest Indiana were securing 96% of their asking prices with just 2.1 months of inventory — a seller’s market buoyed by in-migration from Illinois.

Yet the housing pipeline still lags demand across product types. That is why community-minded projects matter.

The Region embraces this approach, as is evidenced by Michigan City’s approved Tryon Meadow — 218 units mixing rentals, townhomes and single-family homes — pairs new housing with walking paths and a neighborhood layout; Hammond’s Memorial Park Senior Residences and Townhomes proposal adds age-friendly units next to planned for-sale lots.

These are more than inventory improvements. They are placemaking choices that support workforce attraction, aging in place and neighborhood foot traffic — each a precondition for healthy local economies.

Strong sense of community

Decades of research show neighborhoods with strong collective efficacy — neighbors’ willingness to act for the common good — see lower rates of violence even amid economic disadvantage.

That safety dividend lowers operating risk for retailers and helps corridors retain patrons after 5 p.m., turning one-time visitors into regulars.

In other words, placemaking investments that meet individual and community needs generate positive social and economic outcomes such as crime prevention and market growth. Research shows that the combined influence of a community’s skills, resources and its shared commitment to creating a sense of community supports community resilience.

Civic infrastructure

If housing is the steel that we build with, then placemaking is the station-area design that connects us to our daily lives, and civic infrastructure is the network that ensures communities and their residents can function, collaborate and thrive. It can be thought of as soft infrastructure.

The challenge is to recognize that civic infrastructure is equally important, although less tangible. This network of relationships, organizations and shared spaces enables residents to act collectively — and it is as critical to market confidence as roads or fiber.

Ways to multiply the impact:

Create a regional civic leadership academy with IU Northwest and local foundations to train “civic entrepreneurs” to enhance our sense of community.

Measure civic health alongside GDP — publish an annual civic vitality index tracking association activity, volunteer hours and public-realm projects. We can build on the work of the Indiana Bar Foundation and the Indiana Civic Health Index.

Why? Because every dollar spent on facades or rail upgrades yields more when paired with social capital investments. Civic infrastructure is the multiplier that transforms placemaking projects into community-building engines, sustaining momentum and fostering trust.

Affordability fundamental

Nationally, the 2025 State of the Nation’s Housing documents record renter cost burdens and 30-year-low home sales. In Indiana, a worker must now earn $22.07 an hour to afford a modest two-bedroom at fair-market rental rates.

The affordability gap limits families’ economic well-being and stability, constrains hiring, and lowers spending in our communities.

The fix is a unique combination of more housing in places that attract talent and support economic growth, while enhancing a sense of community that fosters trust and a belief in the future of the Region.

The opportunity

Northwest Indiana has the momentum to realize its potential. In this next phase, we continue to build on our successes and identify ways to strengthen our civic infrastructure. We can set housing targets and fund placemaking.

However, building civic infrastructure will require intentional actions on the part of all who live, work and play in the Region. It is not a by-product of economic development but rather a way in which we define who we are, what is important to us as a community, and how individuals can connect and participate in decision making that impacts their everyday lives.

Economic development is successful when it takes root in a place. When we build homes and belonging — walkable blocks, safe crossings, shaded sidewalks, and strong civic networks — we build an economy that lasts. •",https://media.nwindianabusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29150235/2025_10_Viewpoint_Szarleta_1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 21:01:44.372293

Anne Taylor smiled broadly, like a proud mama with bragging rights at a family reunion, as she ticked off Hammond’s commercial real estate development wins.

There were big catches, like landing Meats by Linz, which supplies meats to upscale restaurants, casinos, golf clubs and more. The company eventually bought 10 acres and brought 400 new jobs to Hammond, said Taylor, who is executive director of the city’s planning department.

United Hospital Services and Huhtamaki, a global food packaging supplier, also have been huge for the city.

And, there were small ones, like local mom-and-pop shops that bring something special to the community.

“We focus on developments that have a lot of jobs,” she said. “We love bringing jobs to Hammond, but we also continue to support local businesses.”

Ixxa Coffee, a stylish coffee shop and roaster that also sells plants and pastries, is one example. It opened its doors in a 1,000-square-foot shop in north Hammond in 2021.

From light industrial to office space, from warehousing to major and light manufacturing, down to small businesses and the local doctor’s office, defining commercial real estate, or CRE, is almost like nailing jelly to a wall — you’re not likely to catch it all at once.

Generally, area experts broke CRE into three main categories: office space, industrial and retail — with each having multiple subcategories.

From Hammond to South Bend, regional experts agree Indiana’s strengths are a business-friendly climate, infrastructure like good highways and freight and passenger rail lines, and access to Lake Michigan. This combination makes it attractive to do business in the Region.

“We’re often the first call when companies are looking to relocate or expand,” Taylor said, a sentiment shared by her colleagues across the Lake Michigan’s southern shore.

Growing CRE

Experts repeatedly described the state of Indiana as pro-business and a not-so-conducive environment in neighboring states, particularly Illinois.

Indiana’s lower taxes, good highway and rail infrastructure, lower workers compensation and more affordable workforce are big draws to the Region, according to area experts.

Affordable land prices and a business-friendly government mean more businesses come to the Region, but population increases also are a huge factor, said David Lasser, managing broker for Merrillville-based Commercial In-Sites.

When new people come in, they want restaurants, shops, doctors’ offices and more, and that creates higher demand for commercial development in the area.

“The main driving force that’s been good for Northwest Indiana for many years is a considerable amount of vacant land for development,” said Lasser, who’s been a broker for 37 years. “There’s an ever-growing wave, over at least the last 15 years, of people moving from Illinois to Indiana. Every time somebody builds a home or occupies an apartment unit, it’s that many more heads and bodies to go into restaurants and shops and fill office buildings.”

Antony Miocic, director of Latitude Commercial’s office group, described Northwest Indiana as a suburb of Chicago, but the similarities between the two areas stop there.

“We’re a suburban market,” he said. “We definitely feed off Chicago, for better or worse, so that helps us definitely versus other markets, being close to a large population center like that.”

Office spaces are doing well in Northwest Indiana, with occupancy rates hovering around 90 percent, Lasser said. That average covers Lake, Porter, La Porte, Jasper and Newton counties.

“This means buildings are full,” he said.

Costs count, and a report from Commercial In-Sites published last January indicated the asking price for full-service rental costs for office space in the company’s Lake County portfolio averaged $26.18 per square foot and $24.73 per square foot in Porter County.

By contrast, business renters in the Chicago area, which had a vacancy rate of about 17 percent, could expect an average asking price of $42.85 per square foot, according to the online Savills Research and Data Services.

Office space remains a draw in the Region, in large part because it’s significantly cheaper than in the big city, and the pandemic prompted some trends that affect Indiana today, Miocic said.

For example, when more employees began working from home, a professional services firm paying for office space in Chicago could move across the state line and pay a fraction of the rental costs, Miocic said.

“It’s going to be much cheaper here, so there was definitely that trend in 2020,” he said.

Site location

A big part of encouraging commercial real estate development is knowing what works and what is welcomed in the many communities that make up the Region.

“So, we work with the communities to help them identify where they want to grow and how, and we help them make it happen,” said Bailey Tombers, vice president of business development for the Lake County Economic Alliance.

Typically, businesses already located within the county will contact the LCEA if they want to relocate or expand in the area, but there are plenty of calls from other states, Tombers said. The alliance discusses the site location with individual communities to see if there’s a match in Lake County.

Tombers named community after community in Lake County, noting the kinds of CRE development they usually want.

In Gary, for example, with the Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana and the upcoming convention center, “they’re going to see rapid growth all around that area in a relatively short amount of time, which is going to be very positive for them, but the question is how do we help support that.”

Farther south, Crown Point officials have encouraged preparing land for development, and they’re looking at different businesses that could use easy access to Interstate 65 and other infrastructure.

“The developers are working really well with the city to make sure that land is shovel ready,” Tombers said. “They’re putting up buildings and people are coming to look at them.”

One common refrain among communities in the state’s northwest corner, historically home to pollution belching mills, railroads and other heavy manufacturing, is a move toward something cleaner, she said.

“The communities are really trying to transition away from things that are going to have air emissions,” according to Tombers. “They’re tired of having the reputation of being the place where dirty things go. They like what they have, but they’re trying to diversify their economic clusters.”

About 45 minutes to the east, CRE brokers and experts also consider communities’ needs and interests when helping companies expand or relocate to the area, said Shawn Todd, a longtime broker with Cressy Commercial Real Estate.

Different communities have different personalities, and it’s important to recognize that and guide appropriate businesses toward the communities that fit them, he said.

Elkhart, long known as the recreational vehicle capital of the world and a spot for automotive industry businesses, continues to be heavier in manufacturing, while the South Bend area leans toward office and professional spaces.

“Downtown South Bend is just a different area than Elkhart or even Mishawaka,” Todd said.

Office space

The pandemic upended a lot, including the traditional demand for office space. More people who worked in offices began working from home, but that’s beginning to change too, Todd said.

“This need for private office space is not as much as it was before, and it’s an expense on people’s books they now look at differently,” he said. “Before, they thought they had to have (office space), and now maybe they see they don’t have to have it anymore.”

Still, more businesses are getting tired of having meetings in local coffee shops and restaurants, and they seem to be requiring workers to return to their offices more.

While office rental rates are holding steady, office vacancy is still higher than it should be in the St. Joe area, so that’s unfortunate for the office market, and the rates of office space deals have slowed down recently, Todd said.

“The velocity of deals is not there right now,” he said. “It used to be you could count on a certain number of deals happening each year, but it’s not really happening anymore. It is more challenging. The odd thing is we haven’t seen leasing rates really drop.”

Steel, data distribution

Steel manufacturing, with mills of various sizes dotting the lakeshore and its court of rail and other supporting businesses, still may be the Region’s economic king, but big data and distribution are eyeing the throne.

“We still do steel,” said Lasser, of Commercial In-Sites. “I’m told we make more steel of a higher quality than ever before, however, with less employees due to technology. Steel drives a lot of local vendors.”

Indiana still leads the nation in steel manufacturing, according to the Indiana Economic Digest and the American Iron and Steel Institute. U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs still run massive integrated steel mills along Lake Michigan’s southern shore, and there are plenty of more specialized mini-mills across the seven-county Region.

But, data and distribution are exploding in the area.

There have been giant distribution projects, recently, that capture the business imagination, like the 1-million-square-foot Amazon distribution center planned near I-65 and U.S. 30, the second such center in the area.

Another big catch is the Panduit distribution center — a $76.5 million, 475,000-square-foot behemoth — that will rise on Mississippi Street in Merrillville.

Proximity to Chicago makes Northwest Indiana more attractive, especially for warehousing and distribution businesses, Miocic said.

“We’re the crossroads of America,” he said. “We’re just a prime location for distribution centers. We have companies building (large structures) on spec, which is crazy, when you think about it, but they’re confident they’re going to find a tenant for them.”

Data centers are driving some economic growth in places to some extent, Todd said.

“We’re seeing it (in St. Joe County) and across NWI,” he said. “Data center activity is big. I don’t think there is a county in Northwest Indiana that doesn’t have a data center project.”

That’s not a bad thing, Lasser said. There’s a huge demand locally, regionally and nationally for data centers, even though they require huge amounts of power, and it means the Region is not putting all of its economic eggs in one basket.

“Diversification really helps the job market” Lasser said.

If you build it

Business parks and “spec buildings” still draw businesses to the area.

Spec properties are often massive structures developers build and subdivide to draw businesses. Sometimes, the developers don’t have to divide them at all.

Amazon opened a 190,000-square-foot distribution center at the AmeriPlex at the Crossroads park, built by Holladay Properties, in Merrillville in 2021, and this January, Amazon gobbled up a 1 million-square-foot building at The Silos at Sanders Farm development at the junction of I-65 and U.S. 30.

“Spec is still working,” said the LCEA’s Tombers. “It’s still very attractive. We see a lot of food production, packaging and those types of things. It’s making more sense in Lake County because of our proximity to Chicago.”

Headquartered in South Bend, Holladay Properties has dozens of development properties across Northwest Indiana, said Mike O’Connor, senior vice president of development and leasing.

Holladay also operates properties across several states, many of them mixed-use developments. Holladay broke ground on the 385-acre AmeriPlex at the Port in Portage in 2020, and they began building AmeriPlex at the Crossroads in Merrillville four years later.

“We try to have a pretty balanced portfolio. It’s somewhat influenced by the regional economy,” he said. “I would say we have more light industrial and medical office than residential in Northwest Indiana.”

Next up for Holladay Properties is another AmeriPlex-like business park in Michigan City. The company began developing the area after years of interacting with leaders in that city.

“It’s about aligning with interests in planning by the community,” O’Connor said. “We kind of stay close to the folks that are doing planning with local governments. There’s a great desire in Michigan City to create more opportunities for business growth, including light industrial flex space.”

Flex space is a versatile form of development that attracts a wide range of businesses, from office to warehousing, light industrial and distribution in a single area.

From business to community

Retail also is a big component of CRE, and it has the capacity to build communities where residents live, work and play.

Tucked into a strip mall, coffee shop Ixxa is within reach of a local plant of an international conglomerate that makes bar soap, a railroad yard, a casino and dozens of small businesses.

Jose Marin, who grew up in neighboring Whiting before moving to California, said he noticed a “missing link” in the community when he moved back to the area with his wife, Stephanie Mora.

“In every city where I’ve lived, whether it’s Los Angeles or London, there was always that part of the community that was important, and it was a coffee shop,” Marin said.

Marin and Mora decided to open their own unique coffee shop in 2021. Soon, they added a neighboring space in the strip mall to house their coffee roasting equipment, expanding the store by about 400 square feet.

Last year, they added an outdoor patio space. They could see the immense possibilities behind a community hangout, Marin said. One cool shop, restaurant or bar opens, and others soon follow.

“I’ve seen it before,” he said. “You see this thing that just happens in front of your eyes. The neighborhood can grow and grow and grow, and it all starts with someone in the neighborhood just starting a little community of their own.”

Taylor emphasized that small businesses are the key to commercial development. Getting people to live and work in Hammond requires services and activities that create a sense of community.

“We really want to see more amenities for people living in and moving to Hammond,” she said. •",https://media.nwindianabusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/19173603/Amazon_Merrillville_Rick_Bella_1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 20:03:07.623462

The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate organization, is broadening its scope, looking to build a broad coalition that puts fighting the Trump administration before any single issue.","The Trump administration’s cancellation of more than $7.5 billion in clean energy projects is one of the most tangible signs yet of how the president is viewing the government shutdown — as an “unprecedented opportunity” to gut Democratic priorities.

The Department of Energy announced late Wednesday that it would ax more than 300 grants, without naming them. A list circulating in Washington policy circles — and reported by my colleagues today — ranges from grid infrastructure upgrades and carbon capture demonstrations to building efficiency research and high-profile hydrogen hubs.

What do they have in common? Almost all are in states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

“It shows the political retribution is more important than serving the American people,” a former DOE staffer told POLITICO’s E&E News. “Either that or they are deeply uninformed about the power sector.”

The Trump administration hasn’t confirmed any of the specific cuts, and several grantees said today that they hadn’t heard from DOE.

But President Donald Trump has made it clear he plans to use the government shutdown to dismantle federal programs and target funding that isn’t in line with his agenda. Trump wrote this morning on Truth Social that he would meet with White House budget chief Russ Vought to determine “which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut.”

“I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,” Trump added.

Carbon removal, hydrogen at risk

Among the reported cuts were at least 10 of 21 DOE-backed direct air capture projects — aimed at sucking carbon dioxide from the sky. Some scientists see the emerging technology as a necessary tool to avoid dangerous global warming.

Most of the carbon-removal projects slated for elimination are intended for Democratic-led states, although one was developed by a California company in Wyoming (the company had already backed out). Projects pursued by companies close to the administration — such as Chevron and Fervo Energy — were absent from the list, as were a handful of projects in states like Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota. Also on the chopping block: more than $2 billion for two West Coast hydrogen hubs from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The affected projects in California and the Pacific Northwest aim to demonstrate “green” hydrogen, which uses renewable power to produce a clean alternative to fossil fuels.

Political blowback

Democrats were quick to criticize the cuts, which they said would raise power prices and hurt reliability at a time when electricity demand is skyrocketing.

Take a $600 million grant to California to upgrade 100 miles of electricity transmission lines. The funding was among several grants on the list of cuts from DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Program, which backs projects to shield power infrastructure from extreme weather and reduce outages.

Democrats have also pointed out that the cuts would hurt Republican districts as well. The reported list includes projects in Iowa, Florida and Arizona — which all backed Trump — and others would have had partnerships or outposts in red states. A breakdown from Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said at least 28 GOP districts would see funding cut, plus 108 Democratic districts.

“The Trump Administration continued its assault on cheap energy today, canceling projects designed to lower electricity bills while wasting your taxpayer dollars in the process,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.).

Thune says Republicans ‘don’t control’ White House budget chief

Senate Majority Leader John Thune warned Democrats today that Republicans “don’t control” White House budget chief Russ Vought.

In an exclusive interview, Thune tried to distance himself from the White House’s slash-and-burn response to the government shutdown, writes Jordain Carney. Some Republicans have expressed discomfort with Vought’s promises to conduct mass firings and cut funding for everything from transportation projects to research programs.

“This is the risk of shutting down the government and handing the keys to Russ Vought,” Thune said, adding that “there should have been an expectation” among Democrats that Vought could broadly target government workers and programs in a shutdown.

Climate cuts deepen

The government shutdown isn’t stopping the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back work on climate change, a whole gaggle of our reporters write.

For example, about half of the Interior Department’s staff will be furloughed, but work will continue on fossil fuel permitting projects. Its Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, meanwhile, “will cease all renewable energy activities” but continue work on oil and gas lease sales, according to its shutdown plan.

Just one staffer will be left to work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Climate and Health Program. And the U.S. is not expected to send a delegation to international climate talks in Brazil next month, in part because State Department offices that usually participate are now closed.

A peek behind the staffing curtain

Federal agency shutdown plans are offering new insight into how the federal workforce has shrunk during the second Trump administration, write Jennifer Yachnin, Hannah Northey and Kevin Bogardus.

The plans show that the Environmental Protection Agency has shrunk about 10 percent, the Energy Department nearly 13 percent and the Interior Department 14 percent, compared with September 2024 federal employee data.

More than 201,000 civilian workers have left the federal government since Trump took office, according to data compiled by the Partnership for Public Service.

“What’s always interesting to see is how many employees there are at each agency, and the numbers are smaller. You can clearly see that workforce numbers have been reduced,” said Jenny Mattingley, the Partnership’s vice president of government affairs.

EPA is alleged to have failed to make an attainment determination, violating the Clean Air Act.","The Sierra Club and other organizations filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (“Court”) a September 2nd Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (“Complaint”) against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) alleging a failure to perform a Clean Air Act nondiscretionary duty.

The other organizations joining the Complaint include the Committee for a Better ARVIN, Little Manila Rising and Medical Advocates for Healthy Air (collectively, “Sierra Club”).

The Complaint alleges that EPA has violated the Clean Air Act by failing to make a determination of attainment, or finding of failure to attain, for the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQAS”) in the San Joaquin Valley.

Particulate matter is a generic term for a broad class of chemically and physically diverse substances that exist as discrete particles (liquid droplets or solids) over a wide range of sizes.

States are primarily responsible for ensuring attainment and maintenance of NAAQS once the EPA has established or revised one. Each state is then required to formulate, subject to EPA approval, an implementation plan (i.e., “SIP”) designed to achieve each NAAQS. The SIP is required to attain an individual NAAQS within the air quality region within a certain period of time. Failure to do so requires that EPA within a certain period of time classify it as nonattainment.

The Sierra Club Complaint states that EPA established an NAAQS for PM2.5 of 35 µg/m3 averaged over a 24-hour period in 2006. Further, the agency is stated to have approved California’s request for a maximum five-year extension of the applicable serious area attainment date, extending the attainment date from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2024.

The Complaint further alleges:

...EPA shall, as expeditiously as practicable but no later than June 30, 2025, determine whether the San Joaquin Valley attained, or failed to attain, the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 standard. To date, EPA has failed to make an attainment determination.

EPA is alleged to have failed to make an attainment determination, violating the Clean Air Act.

The Complaint requests that the Court declare that EPA has a duty by June 30, 2025, to make a determination and that the agency continues to violate the Clean Air Act by failing to make an attainment determination. Further, the Court is requested to issue preliminary and permanent injunctions directing EPA to take final action on the attainment determination for the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 standard by December 1, 2025.",https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/images/site/Social_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:59:05.821171

Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

President Donald Trump’s energy policy leans heavily on fossil fuels and dials back the growth in renewables.

Yet West Virginia is one of the nation’s top states in the growth of clean energy jobs.

Curtis Tate spoke with Bob Keefe, the executive director of E2, a group that supports clean energy development, about what recent changes mean for the state and country.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: I was surprised to see West Virginia is one of the top 10 states for job growth in clean energy.

Keefe: As you saw from our numbers, there’s more than almost 11,000 people, 11,000 West Virginians that now work in clean energy one way or another in that state. And that’s energy efficiency. It’s not necessarily that the typical solar panel installer or the wind turbine guy, right? These are energy efficiency jobs, folks making what I believe is one of the oldest housing stocks in the country, in West Virginia, more efficient and saving consumers money on their power bill every year. That’s the biggest part of the clean energy sector nationally, and I believe, also in West Virginia.

But it is solar workers. You had three or four major solar plants open up just in the past six, eight months, in the past year anyway, in places like in Berkeley County, where a new solar plant just opened up on land that I think was formerly a storage site for coal ash.

You got factory workers at places like Form Energy in Weirton, which obviously is a big deal – 450 or so workers now making next generation batteries and what used to be a shuttered steel mill. Just like the rest of the country, these jobs are growing. They’re growing faster than the economy generally.

Tate: The governor wants to expand energy production with fossil fuels and nuclear. He didn’t mention renewables.

Keefe: Which is unfortunate. When you look across the country, 90% of all new power that was added onto the grid last year was solar, wind and batteries. This is where the country’s moving. This is where the world’s moving. I don’t live in West Virginia. I lived in North Carolina for a long time, one of the biggest solar states in the country. I grew up there. And I can tell you that the sun doesn’t shine any brighter in North Carolina than it does in West Virginia. And there’s no reason that the governor needs to continue to tie the energy sources for West Virginians to what has become the most expensive power available.

Tate: Form is building batteries in Weirton. Aren’t those becoming a bigger part of the grid?

Keefe: It’s getting better every day thanks to innovation at companies like Form. I know it’s probably a dirty word, but I’ll bring up California. California now gets about 60% of all of its energy from renewables and batteries on a daily basis. There are many days when the state produces more than 100% energy from solar, wind, and batteries keep the lights on at night.

This is that we’re talking about the fourth biggest economy in the world, in California, and they’re doing it by not adding gas, not adding nukes, not adding coal. They’re doing it strictly through renewables. Look at other countries. They’re doing the same thing. There are other states. Look at Texas. Texas is the number one wind state in the country. I think it’s about to be the number one solar state in the country. It’s also going to be the number one state for battery deployment. There should be nothing political or partisan about creating jobs, driving economic growth and producing cheaper, cleaner energy.

Tate: What’s happening in the rest of the world, especially China?

Keefe: China is adding more clean energy than any place in the world right now. They’re exporting more clean energy products than any place in the world right now. Right now, 90% or so of all solar panels come from China and a few other countries. 90% of all batteries come from China and a few other countries. Finally, America is getting in the game, and it’s happening right there in West Virginia. We’ve got companies like Form that are creating new batteries across the country in the past three years.

I don’t know if you have seen our Clean Energy Project Tracker, but you know, there’s been 400 major clean energy projects announced all over the country. Form there in West Virginia, but certainly battery factories across the country. I think there’s 50 or 60 battery plants that have been announced. There’s 60 solar panel factories that have been announced. There’s 120 electric vehicle related factories that have been announced. This is how America gets back in the game.

All three of New Mexico’s three congressional districts were impacted, with 11 projects related to mining research, renewable energy, and tribal energy initiatives losing funding.

Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez’s 3rd District saw the largest cuts, totaling $81.6 million across four projects, including $50 million from the Tribal Energy Consortium and $15 million for Kit Carson Electric, the Taos-based electric cooperative.

Rep. Melanie Stansbury’s 1st District lost $57.4 million across four projects, with Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) losing $36 million.

Rep. Gabe Vasquez’s 2nd District had $56.2 million eliminated from four awards, all involving the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.

An email to the White House press team asking about the energy projects being terminated received this automatic reply:

“Due to staff shortages resulting from the Democrat Shutdown, the typical 24/7 monitoring of this press inbox may experience delays. We ask for your patience as our staff work to field your requests in a timely manner. As you await a response, please remember this could have been avoided if the Democrats voted for the clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government open. The press office also cannot accommodate waves requests or escorts at this time. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

– The White House Press Team”

When New Mexico Political Report emailed the White House directly, we received a similar response:

House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., criticized the terminations as a “shameless and vindictive attack” designed to target Democrats, eliminate jobs, and raise energy costs.

U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called the decision “nakedly political, unhinged and unlawful,” noting that Congress had already approved and funded these projects.

Heinrich stated he was not given advance notice of the cuts by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

The Molpus Woodlands Group, LLC (Molpus), a leading timberland investment management organization, has, on behalf of its clients, successfully purchased approximately 173,000 acres of timberland in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi combined.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251002295928/en/

Along the Mississippi River.

The properties consist of well-managed, high quality timberlands. Molpus believes these timberlands present a desirable investment opportunity because they are strategically located in areas with diverse and numerous pulpwood, plywood, and dimensional lumber facilities, strong mill proximity and growth potential. The timberlands also present potential diversified income opportunities such as solar projects, carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, recreation income, and pine straw harvesting.

Molpus’s vertically integrated team will oversee the management of these timberlands including daily operations such as planning sustainable harvests, reforesting and nurturing young stands, and protecting wildlife habitat and water resources. In addition to these core management activities, Molpus will focus on creating long-term value through existing and new value add opportunities to help enhance both the investment potential as well as the environmental and community impacts of these forests. Molpus plans to include these timberlands in its certification with the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® forest management standard, which includes key measures to protect biodiversity, sustainable harvest levels, water quality, protection of at-risk species, wildlife habitat, and regeneration.

“As a long-time manager in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, we are excited to add these forests to regions where we already have a strong presence,” said Terrell Winstead, President and CEO of Molpus. “It is our view that these properties provide our clients with positive exposure to areas with established histories of sustainable timber production as well as numerous impact and value add opportunities.”

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified.
Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

A city where clean air, smart infrastructure, and economic opportunity go hand in hand. We’ve had meaningful conversations with the public and we invite everyone to stay involved and help guide the next steps.”

Louisville hired AECOM and EHI Consultants in November of 2024 to help create a two-part EV Readiness Plan. The draft of the community plan outlines recommendations and strategies to expand public EV infrastructure and remove barriers to EV adoption. A forthcoming component of the plan outlines steps needed to transition the city’s fleet to zero-emission vehicles. Together, both components support the city’s sustainability goals of achieving 100% clean energy for Metro Government operations by 2035 and 100% community-wide by 2040.

What’s in the Plan:

Current EV Trends & Future Demand: EV ownership in Jefferson County tripled between 2021 and 2024, signaling the need for a major scale-up in public charging infrastructure to meet projected growth through 2040.

Community Voices and Ideas: Insights from surveys, focus groups, and stakeholder engagement shaped the plan’s priorities, identifying barriers such as cost, EV range concerns,and lack of home charging access.

Infrastructure Gaps & Priority Areas: The plan pinpoints areas most in need of charging stations, including multifamily housing, employment hubs, shopping destinations,and historically underserved neighborhoods.

Implementation Strategies: Outlines actions guiding a citywide EV transition, including public-private deployment models, workforce training, permitting reform, and funding pathways.

“We’ve heard from residents, community organizations, and key stakeholders across Louisville,” said Katie Littman, Deputy Director for the Cabinet of Economic Development. “They told us where charging is needed, the barriers that stand in the way, and how we can make this transition work for everyone in our city.”

The Cabinet for Economic Development assembled a steering committee of internal agencies to lead this process, including the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Facilities and Fleet. The Department of Transportation will lead implementation moving forward.

The release of the draft plan follows a major announcement from Ford Motor Company. In August, Ford announced it will invest $2 billion to retool Louisville’s Assembly Plant for electric vehicle production. The investment secured 2,200 local jobs and put Louisville firmly at the forefront of Ford’s EV rollout.

Residents, businesses, and organizations are encouraged to review the plan and share feedback. The public comment period is now open and will run through Friday, October 31. Click here to view the EV Readiness Plan.

The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases.","Coloradans’ window to receive thousands of dollars in federal tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles has closed. But they’ll soon have the opportunity to tap into larger state-level benefits starting next month.

Colorado is boosting rebates through the state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program for new and used electric vehicles by thousands of dollars starting on Nov. 3, according to an announcement on Thursday from Gov. Jared Polis’ office.

The program aims to incentivize more electric vehicle use by offering rebates to Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid. Starting on Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle will increase from $6,000 to $9,000, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones.

The incentive boost comes after Congress ended a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles, which expired on Sept. 30. Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, the benefit was created under former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a major climate and health law.

The tax credit was initially set to last through 2032, but Republicans in Congress cut that timeline short as part of the sweeping tax and spending-cut law they passed this summer, which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office. Electric vehicles account for a quarter of all car sales in Colorado so far in 2025.

Funding for Colorado’s vehicle exchange program comes from fees on package and food delivery services. Money for the higher rebates will come from the program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, according to Polis’ office.

The rebates are reserved for Coloradans changing from cars that are at least 12 years old or that fail a Colorado emissions test. Households must also make under 80% of their county’s area median income to qualify.

The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, is being reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting on Jan. 1, 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

Meeting North Carolina’'s energy needs, he said, “Also means welcoming companies with net-zero emission targets and creating more opportunities to grow our already strong clean energy economy.” There are nearly 110,000 clean energy jobs in the state.
To accomplish these tasks, Wilson said, “We must ramp up our clean energy projects, modernize our electrical grid, and continue innovating in energy efficiency and energy conservation.
The state Energy Office is investing $20 million in seven projects to update infrastructure around the state.
I think we all recognize the path to prosperity runs directly through a clean energy economy.”","Governor Josh Stein said via a video message today that North Carolina’s energy demands are rapidly rising and its power generation and grid must be prepared for the growth it is experiencing.

The governor made his video message for the Center for Energy Education’s EnergyFEST, which was played before North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson gave his keynote address.

“That means rebuilding critical infrastructure in western North Carolina and adapting to a change in climate so that North Carolina remains resilient into the future,” the governor said.

The need for these improvements has been made clear “in the wake of action by the federal government and by our own General Assembly that threatens to stifle the clean energy economy and raise our utility bills.”

(See related story at this link)

In August, Stein launched the Energy Policy Taskforce in an effort to lower energy bills for North Carolina families and promote renewable energy. “When we have lower emissions and improve energy efficiency, everyone benefits.”

Stein said earlier this year the state launched the Energy Saver NC rebate program, which rewards households for installing energy-efficient appliances, improving home insulation, and upgrading electrical systems.

Meeting North Carolina’'s energy needs, he said, “Also means welcoming companies with net-zero emission targets and creating more opportunities to grow our already strong clean energy economy.”

There are nearly 110,000 clean energy jobs in the state. “We need to work together and continue our support for investments in that economy so that we can push that number higher.”

Stein said North Carolina is and will continue to be a leader in the clean energy economy “because it’s an investment in our people and our future.”

Wilson

Wilson, who has been on the job for nine months, said, “From day one there was one thing that was crystal clear, and that is that our department makes peoples’ lives healthier and better every single day in all 100 counties. Every day we are working to safeguard our air quality, water quality, and making sure our lands are healthy.”

The secretary said Stein is committed to expanding the state’s economy and creating good-paying jobs, especially in clean energy, and to reducing greenhouse gases and other air, water, and chemical pollution.

To accomplish these tasks, Wilson said, “We must ramp up our clean energy projects, modernize our electrical grid, and continue innovating in energy efficiency and energy conservation. We need sufficient electricity to support economic growth, new industries, and a rapidly growing population — all the while keeping prices affordable in their homes.”

Wilson said it makes sense for the state to invest in clean energy. “We keep seeing increasingly devastating storms.”

Some of the biggest hurricanes in the state — Matthew, Florence, and Helene — were considered 1,000-year storms but all occurred within eight years. “The vast majority of the world’s climate experts agree that the cause of these more intense storms is in fact greenhouse gas emissions, so we really do need to keep investing in clean energy and driving down those emissions if we want to avoid the kinds of disasters we’ve seen in recent years.”

He said the state has received more than 5,400 applications for the Energy Saver NC program. “By investing in home energy efficiency and conservation, we are investing in people.”

The Weatherization Assistance Program helps 1,100 households per year become more energy-efficient. The state Energy Office is investing $20 million in seven projects to update infrastructure around the state.

The state has $5 million invested through regional partners in western North Carolina for microgrids.

In the last few years the state has seen more than $24 billion in clean energy investment, Wilson said, adding that over 15 years the state has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by around 50 percent.

The state is now at a point where renewable energy produces about 15 percent of the electricity generated.

Headwinds

There are headwinds, however. “The United States Department of Energy recently canceled our $156 million Solar for All program. We are contesting that with the EPA.”

The administration in Washington has canceled offshore wind projects and earlier this week announced a plan to increase coal as an energy source across the country. “Popular clean energy tax credits will expire in three months,” he said. “Duke Energy yesterday submitted their latest carbon plan to the Utilities Commission, and it extends the life of coal plants. It relies more on gas and puts off renewable investments for some time.”

And on the state level, Wilson said lawmakers passed a bill which removes the interim 70 percent reduction goal in carbon. “It does keep the zero carbon (target) by 2050 but it removes the interim goal, which we think would be important to keep having the foot on the gas to get it there in time by 2050.”

He said despite the obstacles, “We have to continue to prioritize energy efficiency, resilience, and clean energy deployment. We have to keep investing in the people of North Carolina, building opportunity in every county through clean energy. I think we all recognize the path to prosperity runs directly through a clean energy economy.”",https://www.rrspin.com/media/sigplus/preview/08708afcb21edef3485e3e01f9a8c4dd.jpeg,N,,2025-10-02 18:02:39.968881

It also now aims to delay the construction of new nuclear power plants until later in the 2030s.

“In a rational world, we're going to have wind development in North Carolina.” The Oct. 1 blueprint from Duke is a first draft.","When North Carolina’s GOP-led legislature nixed a key decarbonization deadline for Duke Energy in July, critics feared it would upend the state’s transition to clean energy.

Now, a proposal Duke just submitted to regulators shows they were right to worry as the utility, North Carolina’s largest, seeks to walk back its clean-energy ambitions and enact one of the most aggressive fossil-fuel expansions in the nation.

Without a mandate to cut climate-warming emissions 70% from 2005 levels by 2030, the utility intends to build about half as much wind and solar capacity over the next decade compared to its previous trajectory. It also now aims to delay the construction of new nuclear power plants until later in the 2030s. Battery storage is the sole bright spot for clean energy in the blueprint — Duke wants to invest in about 1.5 gigawatts more than it did before.

Meanwhile, the company proposes to extend the life of aging coal plants and develop more natural-gas units, bringing its total build-out of new fossil-fuel plants to 9.7 gigawatts by 2035 and as much as 12.3 gigawatts by 2040.

“It’s certainly a regressive vision for North Carolina’s energy future,” said Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.

Underlying Duke’s proposal is the unprecedented growth in electricity demand it expects from new large energy users, especially data centers. If the company’s “high load” projections materialize, its carbon emissions could rise by one-third or more by the middle of the next decade.

After that, greenhouse gases will “rapidly decline” as nuclear power plants come online, Dukes says in its proposal to regulators.

Critics say the increase in pollution puts a midcentury net-zero carbon target that remains in state law further from reach and burdens consumers with rising fuel costs.

“Delaying coal power plant retirements and adding new fossil generation is digging the hole deeper, not advancing toward where state law says we need to get,” said David Neal, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “We have to find a way to get on a path to 2050 compliance with fuel-free resources that we know will be in the best longer-term interests of customers.”

Duke’s proposed blueprint largely aligns with how experts predicted the company would behave without the 2030 deadline to curb greenhouse gas emissions. “This is just about what we expected,” said Will Scott, Southeast climate and clean energy director with the Environmental Defense Fund.

The plan also reflects the federal government’s increasing hostility to renewable energy — and its unrelenting push to accelerate fossil-fuel use.

President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have in recent months slashed incentives and grant programs for clean-energy projects and, in some cases, moved to block in-progress installations.

At the same time, Trump has tried to prop up coal — the nation’s most expensive and polluting source of power — including via a Monday announcement of $625 million for the industry. As Duke notes in its plan, the administration has also relaxed other rules around carbon emissions and toxic ash from coal plants, although a future president could reverse course.

Duke is responding accordingly. The company now wants to keep 4.1 gigawatts of its coal fleet running longer than it previously planned, instead of investing in proven clean-energy technology, said Mikaela Curry, manager for Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. “It’s just so frustrating,” she said.

“It’s clear that national political sentiment is making its way into this plan,” said Brooks. “I don't know what else accounts for prolonging coal, because the economics are certainly not on its side.”

Before the rollback of the state climate law, cuts to federal incentives for renewables, and Trump’s particularly vicious attacks on wind energy, Duke had planned to add 13.2 gigawatts of solar and 4.5 gigawatts of onshore and offshore wind by 2035, according to the state’s nonpartisan customer advocate, Public Staff. Now, the utility envisions 9.2 gigawatts of solar — and no wind at all until at least 2040.

“That’s clearly a response to political winds and not our resource winds,” Brooks said. “In a rational world, we're going to have wind development in North Carolina.”

The Oct. 1 blueprint from Duke is a first draft. Now, clean-energy advocates begin the arduous work of combing through the utility’s modeling assumptions and dozens of portfolios. They and other stakeholders have six months to offer written responses. The state’s Utilities Commission has until the end of next year to approve or amend Duke’s plan.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yHx.fxbCWpmsWIvGMQA6eA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/a24015ae37d8b0a40e9096680b9e5d6f,N,,2025-10-02 22:00:44.276679

The grants were through DOE’s Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Grid Deployment; Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains; Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy; and Fossil Energy.
In a news release, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, described “Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states” as “nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful.
And now those cancelled energy projects have become the latest casualty of Trump’s vengeful attack on the American people.” The projects, Heinrich’s statement noted, were already approved and funded by Congress and are ones that “create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward.

In a news release, the department said the canceled projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

In a post on social media, Russell Vought, director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, listed 16 states in which grants had been canceled, including New Mexico, and wrote: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” An Associated Press story identified the states as ones that had all voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The grants were through DOE’s Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Grid Deployment; Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains; Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy; and Fossil Energy.

The projects, Heinrich’s statement noted, were already approved and funded by Congress and are ones that “create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward. Instead of working to help our families and communities.”

The projects in New Mexico include $42.7 million to New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology for the third phase of a project to a project to develop a storage hub at a commercial scale within San Juan basin; $35.6 million for PNM for a “virtual power plant enablement that improves grid stability and reduces customers’ electricity bills”; and $15.4 million for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative for a distributed battery energy storage system.

Heinrich said in his statement he had lunch with DOE Secretary Chris Wright shortly before news of the cancelled projects broke. “He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included ten projects in my state,” Heinrich noted, “projects that affect real jobs and real families. That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions. The American people deserve a government that works for them, not one that plays politics with their lives.

The source would provide a comparison of pre-project actual emissions with projections of post-project actual emissions to determine whether any proposed construction would result in a significant emissions increase.
This ability to question emissions calculations allowed EPA to delay construction projects before they began.
Reducing EPA’s role in assessing the NSR applicability calculations has both a temporal and substantive impact on project planning.
By creating clearer regulatory pathways and trusting states to handle permitting processes at the local level, the readoption should provide opportunities to streamline the planning and construction process for any emission source modification projects.","In support of the administration’s efforts to facilitate the development of data centers, on September 15, 2025, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced at a White House artificial intelligence roundtable that the agency plans to readopt a 2017 memo issued by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt (the Pruitt Memo) concerning the Clean Air Act's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program. The Pruitt Memo, which was rescinded by the Biden administration in 2022, provided that EPA would not “second-guess” pre-project emissions projections made by permit applicants and/or state permit writers, providing applicants and state permitting agencies increased latitude in determining whether certain projects triggered NSR requirements.

Though presented as an effort to cut red tape for projects powering artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and data centers, readoption of the Pruitt Memo would have implications well beyond the AI realm, including the permitting of traditional sources typically subject to NSR. By potentially streamlining NSR permitting processes and shielding certain permitting decisions from federal scrutiny, the policy change could provide entities looking to modify sources that may have otherwise been considered a major modification increased certainty and flexibility by allowing them to work dependably alongside local environmental agencies to ensure projects are below emissions permitting thresholds.

There are at least two immediate impacts of this readoption—first, entities constructing new projects will have greater flexibility in the planning for permitting a new source to reduce the burdens and impacts of the permitting process required under old NSR guidelines. For instance, under NSR regulations, for existing sources contemplating a modification, an Actual-to-Project-Actual Applicability (APTA) test is utilized to determine whether a proposed project triggers NSR permitting requirements. The source would provide a comparison of pre-project actual emissions with projections of post-project actual emissions to determine whether any proposed construction would result in a significant emissions increase. Under previous regulations, a facility would estimate what its actual air pollution levels would be after a proposed modification, and EPA could question any assumptions made by the facility used in estimating those post-modification actual emissions. This ability to question emissions calculations allowed EPA to delay construction projects before they began.

Second, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo means EPA will not second-guess project emissions projections provided by the applicant unless there is a clear error or violation of procedural requirements, providing the source with much greater leeway in avoiding the typical NSR permitting process for new projects. Reducing EPA’s role in assessing the NSR applicability calculations has both a temporal and substantive impact on project planning. Project applicants will have greater certainty with respect to the timing of the process, and it will facilitate modifications where the state permitting agency and applicant agree on the calculations demonstrating no significant emissions increases.

Ultimately, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo appears encouraging for project proponents, who should experience more flexibility in developing applications that would not trigger NSR and should be able to receive permits in less time. If EPA is essentially precluded from second-guessing the emissions estimates and subsequent decisions of state permit writers who determine whether certain projects rise to the level of a “major modification” that would require additional NSR review absent clear error, there should be more certainty in the permitting process and less time spent waiting for EPA review.

Overall, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo may provide new opportunities for entities looking to complete source modification projects to do so with increased certainty and flexibility through cooperation with local environmental agencies. By creating clearer regulatory pathways and trusting states to handle permitting processes at the local level, the readoption should provide opportunities to streamline the planning and construction process for any emission source modification projects. This decision by EPA, which is being described as a necessary catalyst for projects powering AI infrastructure and data centers, may therefore result in shorter process for not only AI-focused projects but for the entire industrial sector.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/abstract-conceptual/green_508443891_largetile.jpg?rev=9014d429972a45f994cc3f28f5629e9c&hash=F7D4B0D5D6E16E7E9A7ACDE4AB94BD2D,N,,2025-10-02 17:02:42.859305

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office.
The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases.","Coloradans’ window to receive thousands of dollars in federal tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles has closed. But they’ll soon have the opportunity to tap into larger state-level benefits starting next month.

Colorado is boosting rebates through the state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program for new and used electric vehicles by thousands of dollars starting on Nov. 3, according to an announcement on Thursday from Gov. Jared Polis’ office.

The program aims to incentivize more electric vehicle use by offering rebates to Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid. Starting on Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle will increase from $6,000 to $9,000, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones.

The incentive boost comes after Congress ended a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles, which expired on Sept. 30. Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, the benefit was created under former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a major climate and health law.

The tax credit was initially set to last through 2032, but Republicans in Congress cut that timeline short as part of the sweeping tax and spending-cut law they passed this summer, which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office. Electric vehicles account for a quarter of all car sales in Colorado so far in 2025.

Funding for Colorado’s vehicle exchange program comes from fees on package and food delivery services. Money for the higher rebates will come from the program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, according to Polis’ office.

The rebates are reserved for Coloradans changing from cars that are at least 12 years old or that fail a Colorado emissions test. Households must also make under 80% of their county’s area median income to qualify.

The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, is being reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting on Jan. 1, 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

While the rebate program is somewhat insulated from budget pressures since its funding is derived from fees, the state’s electric vehicle tax credit is directly tied to available tax revenue.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/10/02142753/EV-1024x699.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 17:02:15.693129

AG Rokita says these rules inflate car prices, hitting low-income Hoosiers hardest and keeping older vehicles on the road.","HENDERSON, Ky. (WEHT) – Attorney General Todd Rokita and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) Commissioner Clint Woods are championing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) plan to repeal climate regulations for cars and trucks.

According to AG Rokita, these regulations, which he says cost Americans $54 billion annually, rest on the Obama EPA’s 2009 decision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. AG Rokita said these regulations restrict Hoosiers’ ability to access affordable vehicles and hurt Indiana’s small businesses in the manufacturing and industrial industries.

“These rules are a bureaucratic power grab that burdens hardworking Hoosiers and families with unaffordable regulations,” Rokita said. “By scrapping it, the EPA would be restoring common sense, the rule of law, and American energy independence. We fully support the rollback to restore polices that put our country back on the path to prosperity and protect Hoosier workers.”

Officials say the letter argues the Obama EPA misused a statute that Congress designed in the 1960s and 1970s to tackle local problems like smog, not global warming. AG Rokita says recent Supreme Court decisions have made clear that EPA cannot regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases based on speculative concerns about their indirect effects on the environment.

Attorney General Rokita added that the rule’s science is shaky, relying on what he calls “outdated predictions that overstate” CO2’s impact. AG Rokita says even if the U.S. stopped all car emissions, it wouldn’t noticeably change global temperatures. AG Rokita says these rules inflate car prices, hitting low-income Hoosiers hardest and keeping older vehicles on the road.

“The U.S. EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding and its resulting greenhouse gas regulations exceed the Agency’s limited authority under the Clean Air Act and suffer from significant scientific, procedural, and legal defects,” said IDEM Commissioner Woods. “Given Indiana’s primary responsibility for air pollution control, its proven track record of improving air quality, and its bottom-up success in reducing greenhouse gases without federal overreach, IDEM strongly supports reconsidering these heavy-handed standards that impose costs on Hoosiers without delivering measurable environmental benefits.”

The automaker said on Thursday that it delivered 497,099 EVs between July and September, a 7.3% year-over-year increase and a new high for its EV sales.

The Model Y and the Model 3 accounted for the vast majority of these sales. The two EVs combined for 481,166 units delivered, which is more than 9% year-over-year growth, benefitting from the last-minute sales rush in the U.S. before the federal tax credit ended on Sept. 30.

Deliveries of the Cybertruck, Model X and the Model S plummeted sharply compared to last year. Tesla categorizes these as ""other models,"" which accounted for just 15,933 deliveries, a 30% year-over-year drop.

The Model X and Model S also received a mild refresh this year. Tesla does not release the production and delivery numbers for individual models. Here are the full results for the quarter:

The overall deliveries seem to have exceeded Wall Street expectations, which Reuters estimated at about 441,500, citing market intelligence firm Visible Alpha.

Tesla has been under pressure this year due to uneven sales in the U.S. and falling sales globally. Once an EV sales leader in Europe, the automaker has lost ground to rivals such as BYD and Volkswagen. CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics has also hurt buyer sentiment on the continent.

The automaker's slowdown in Europe seems to have been partly offset by U.S. buyers that rushed to claim the $7,500 federal tax credit before the Trump administration ended it on Sept. 30.

Tesla is now amid a massive transition, focusing more on robotics and AI and less on its passenger vehicle business.

There's also a crucial shareholder vote coming up on November 6, when investors will vote for Musk's trillion-dollar compensation plan, which is tied to ambitious performance targets like 20 million vehicle sales, a fleet of one million robotaxis in commercial operation and a market cap of $8.5 trillion.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/rKqgpX/s1/tesla-model-y.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 21:59:23.010722

In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.","The Trump administration on Wednesday nixed funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and several hundred other federally-subsidized clean energy projects in Democratic-led states.

Democratic politicians from Oregon and Washington state immediately cried foul and vowed to challenge what they called an “illegal” clawback of Congressionally-directed spending.

The tri-state Northwest hydrogen hub launched last year to funnel up to $1 billion in federal taxpayer funding to the region to kickstart production and use of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel. Private industry, truckmakers, transit and seaport partners were to bring large sums to the table in matching funds over the next eight to ten years.

But Trump administration officials voiced deep skepticism about climate and green energy initiatives championed by the previous Biden administration.

In a social media post Wednesday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought celebrated the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in what he called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

A follow-up news release that went out under Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s name said that his agency determined the cancelled projects did “not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub attracted bipartisan support locally as a means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray blasted the Trump administration in a statement for playing “some sort of sick political game” on the first day of the partial government shutdown.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Murray said.

In total, the Trump administration pulled funding for 223 clean energy projects in 16 states. Political observers quickly noted that nearly all of the cancelled projects were in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.

“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats – it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” Murray said. “I will be standing firm against this corrupt abuse of power – and every Republican should think carefully about what precedent they want to set by allowing this weaponization of taxpayer dollars.”

Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a prepared statement Thursday that his office was working with state Attorney General Nick Brown to “fight this illegal action.”

Ironically, the majority of the hydrogen production infrastructure for the Northwest hub project was to be built in counties that voted for Trump, such as Benton and Lewis counties in Washington, Baker and Morrow counties in Oregon, and the St. Regis, Montana area.

The Trump administration Wednesday also cancelled the California clean hydrogen hub known as ARCHES, but left in place the funding for five other nascent hubs selected in a highly competitive national contest overseen by Biden’s Energy Department in 2023.

Most of the surviving hubs align more closely with the current administration’s energy priorities by producing hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture or by using nuclear power.

Smaller, but not really small, clean energy grants pulled too

A $250 million project to upgrade power transmission lines on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon was also reportedly on the list of federal grant terminations. The project was meant to increase capacity to transmit renewable electricity generated in central Oregon to customers in the Willamette Valley. A spokesperson for Portland General Electric, the transmission line’s owner, was unsure Thursday whether the utility had received a formal grant termination notice.

Aggrieved Democratic Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, shared a list of other project cancellations, which included four Department of Energy grants to Washington State University for solar energy and vehicle technology development, totalling nearly $10 million.

The termination list also noted a bigger – nearly $68 million – hit to Bellevue, Washington-based truck maker PACCAR, which was to receive assistance for developing and manufacturing cleaner semi trucks.

Further down the casualty list was a $10 million award to CleanFiber to help that company build a new factory in Chehalis, Washington, to turn recycled cardboard into home insulation.

The Department of Energy said the sponsors of terminated projects have 30 days to appeal their canceled funding. Some recipients have already started the appeal process, according to the department.

Big investments near Bellingham and Richland now in doubt

The biggest single component within the Northwest hydrogen hub was a planned $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, which was to produce hydrogen on site as a key ingredient. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro has already started permit applications for the big plant and lined up customers.

Close behind in terms of investment and scale, Calgary-based AltaGas had a plan to redevelop the closed Intalco aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

It’s unclear what happens now. Both corporate boards had postponed making final investment decisions because of the uncertainty about federal subsidies and tax credits.

“Our investment in the Intalco lands remains a priority. We will continue to explore development opportunities that align with our values and deliver lasting benefits to the region,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

Other smaller participants in the PNWH2 Hub had plans to build green hydrogen fueling and distribution infrastructure. Those outfits joined the hub to receive subsidies for design, construction and startup costs.

Plans included hydrogen refueling stations for big trucks along Interstate 84 in Eastern Oregon and on I-90 in far western Montana as well as hydrogen fuel cell transit bus expansion in southwest Washington.

There were signs of trouble for the hub prior to this week – consequences of the slower-than-expected emergence of demand for hydrogen fuel and the high cost of production. A half dozen energy developers exited from various projects that were originally included in the Northwest hydrogen hub’s federal funding proposal. Notable names to get cold feet over the past year included Fortescue, Portland General Electric, Mitsubishi Power, First Mode and Puget Sound Energy.

Prospective large-scale clean hydrogen producers Fortescue, Atlas Agro and AltaGas were also having a hard time locating affordable sources of renewable electricity in the quantities needed to split water molecules to make pure hydrogen.

In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.

“Whether or not this grant funding remains, I’m encouraged that the trail is now blazed for more development and projects to be delivered in this market and that there will be a bright future for H2 as a highly successful and lucrative energy product in the future in our region,” Green wrote.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hydrogen-hub-3-2048x1176.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 17:02:28.110922

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the agency was “reviewing” the awards in May. He testified in Congress that his office would make a decision about many of them by the end of the summer, but this week’s terminations — amid the government shutdown — are the first announcement the agency has made since an initial batch of cuts at the end of May.

2. The Big Apple is paying the price for the government shutdown

The Trump administration said Wednesday that it is putting $18 billion in funding for New York City transit projects on hold while it investigates violations of a rule barring diversity considerations in hiring that the Department of Transportation published on Tuesday. “The timing is, shall we say, noteworthy,” my colleague Matthew Zeitlin wrote on Wednesday, “not least because the Democrats’ two top congressional negotiators — Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer — are both from New York.” In a statement, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy blamed those two lawmakers for the shutdown, lamenting that thanks to them, “USDOT’s review of New York’s unconstitutional practices will take more time.”

3. Blackrock to buy AES

Blackrock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners, an investment fund, is in talks to buy energy developer AES for more than $38 billion in “what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers of all time,” according to the Financial Times. AES owns utilities in Ohio and Indiana in addition to owning both conventional and renewable energy generation projects across the globe. The company is also the top supplier of renewable energy to corporate buyers in the world. AES stock jumped nearly 17% on Wednesday on the news.

4. More data on data center costs

A new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that residential customers in seven states that are part of the PJM Interconnection, an electricity market that covers the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest, are paying nearly $4.4 billion for transmission upgrades intended to deliver electricity to data centers. The finding is not a big surprise — PJM’s own Market Monitor has acknowledged that data center load growth is the primary factor driving up rates. But the report specifically analyzes the amount the whole ratebase is shelling out for transmission projects that only benefit a single customer. It recommends that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission create a new customer class for such customers and require them to shoulder the cost alone.

5. Carbon cycle research gets a cash infusion

Trump has slashed millions in grants for climate science research and plans to cut the federal government’s climate science funding and staff dramatically in next year’s budget. Stepping in to replace some of that lost cash is Schmidt Sciences, a philanthropy founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Schmidt announced Thursday that it’s committing up to $45 million over five years for research to advance understanding of some of the least-studied parts of the global carbon cycle. For example, one project will measure how much carbon dioxide the Southern Ocean absorbs from the atmosphere with the help of robotic sailboats that can collect data year-round, including during times when it’s too dangerous for research ships to operate.

Hyundai is cutting the price tag on its 2026 Ioniq 5 by nearly $10,000, and will continue to offer $7,500 off the 2025 model — equivalent to the now-expired federal tax credit. The 2026 Ioniq 5 base model will start at just $35,000, making it one of the cheapest EVs available in the U.S.

“We are in a unique moment right now,” Carmichael Roberts, a managing partner at BEV told me via email. “Over the past decade, the climate tech ecosystem has made enormous progress driving innovation across every sector of the economy. That puts us in the position to step back and ask first, what areas are still crying out for urgent innovation?”

This year has also seen a number of climate tech companies struggle at key points in their attempts to scale. Sodium-ion battery company Natron Energy shut down in September, while direct air capture leader Climeworks laid off 22% of its staff in May, citing “current macroeconomic uncertainty” and “shifting policy priorities where climate tech is seeing reduced momentum.” Another direct air capture company, Noya, shuttered this August, while the battery recycling company Li-Cycle filed for bankruptcy in May.

Other startups pursuing emerging technologies — from carbon capture to long-duration battery storage, advanced geothermal, and next-generation nuclear — are looking to avoid the same fate. But while federal funding from places such as the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Loan Programs Office once provided an avenue for financing capital-intensive demonstration plants, the Trump administration is now retracting funding, going so far as to cancel contracts with projects previously approved under Biden.

The Oneworld fund, announced in mid-September, is BEV’s first to focus on a specific theme and its first to be backed by an industry coalition. Members of the Oneworld Alliance — which include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, and Cathay Pacific — had already committed to using SAF for 10% of their fuel by 2030, while also “playing an active role in the development of SAF at commercial scale.” Now, with alliance members serving as limited partners in the venture fund, they’ll benefit from the technical and commercial expertise of one of the sector’s most influential VC firms.

When I asked the BEV team to what degree the current political and economic uncertainties were making partnerships like this more valuable, Eric Toone, another BEV managing partner, responded with a refrain I’ve become familiar with — that the firm only backs technologies that “can ultimately compete on their own merits.” Yet it’s undeniable that the federal government tore up its decarbonization agenda at a moment when many climate tech firms’ investments are almost ready for deployment, a stage when government support can make all the difference.

“Many promising SAF technologies already exist, but they are stuck between lab success and commercial scale,” Roberts told me. “This is the moment when they most need capital, technical rigor, and committed offtake to bridge that gap.” While the Trump administration did maintain and extend the tax credit for clean fuels, it also reduced the maximum credit amount for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1, while private funding for SAF production and distribution infrastructure remains inadequate.

Given this landscape and the urgency airlines face in meeting their clean fuel targets, Toone told me the firm is open to backing companies “that are further along than what a typical BEV fund might pursue.” And while sustainable fuels are the first technology to benefit from this type of thematic focus, Roberts said that BEV is already eyeing other sectors where it plans to apply this same funding model.

As of early September, the firm is also part of the All Aboard Coalition. This elite group of venture firms is aiming to raise a $300 million fund by the end of October that will match investments in later-stage venture rounds, filling a gap known in climate tech circles as the “missing middle.” Assembled by Chris Anderson, an entrepreneur and primary convener of the TED Talks conference — which has featured many inspiring climate visionaries — the group includes 14 members such as Khosla Ventures, Prelude Ventures, DCVC, Gigascale Capital, and Energy Impact Partners.

“One of the consequences of being in the front row seat at TED all these years is you get persuaded of certain things,” he told me. “And I definitely got persuaded that climate is the outstanding, major problem we really have to fix.”

The bulk of the capital for the coalition will come from outside investors, though some members will contribute as well, Anderson told me. The goal is to incentivize these hotshots to co-invest with each other, providing a one-to-one funding match if they do so.

“First-of-a-kind rounds seem out of reach for a lot of people in the chain,” Anderson explained, referring to the network of investors that must come together to help a company fund expensive new infrastructure. At this stage, its tech has progressed beyond the capital-light, early-stage rounds but is still considered too risky for traditional infrastructure investors to take on. Companies might be seeking $100 million or more from venture firms that are used to writing checks for orders of magnitude less. “Really the purpose of the fund is to create a collective belief that there is a pathway to getting these companies funded. If you have that collective belief, then it’s much easier for a lead investor to step forward and to pull a few other people in.”

Anderson acknowledged that a $300 million fund will not go “nearly far enough.”

“It’s a starter fund. It’s a proof of concept,” he told me. “The world needs to make a couple hundred of these bets at some point.”

Other coalitions, such as the Climate Tech Atlas, are working to steer the sector towards the best bets. This group — which also includes Breakthrough Energy Ventures, alongside others such as the nonprofit investment platform Elemental Impact, the consulting firm McKinsey, and Stanford University’s Doerr School of Sustainability — has mapped out the technological milestones it sees as the clearest pathways to decarbonization. The aim is to help investors, founders, policymakers and academics alike direct their energies towards the most relevant and investable opportunities, regardless of political headwinds.

“The scale at which the government participates in the development of these new technologies — or puts a thumb on the scale for technologies in particular — will vary,” Sonia Aggarwal, CEO of the policy firm Energy Innovation, which is also a member of the alliance, told me. “But certainly that has no real bearing on the fundamental fact that innovators are out there right now thinking about these grand challenges, and there are exciting new ideas for technologies that can get to that commercial scale in the coming years.”

And indeed, sometimes the most promising ideas can take shape in moments of deep uncertainty. Some of the biggest success stories of recent tech history — Uber, Airbnb, WhatsApp, and Square — all got their start during the 2008 financial crisis or its aftermath. “Some of the strongest companies and founders are building in uncertain times,” Dawn Lippert, founder and CEO of Elemental Impact, told me. “That’s very much what we see right now.”

These groups are far from the only private-sector actors coming together to help navigate industry headwinds. When the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew support for the most widely used U.S.-based carbon accounting model for estimating scope 3 emissions, leading emissions accounting platform Watershed partnered with Stanford University’s Sustainable Solutions Lab to launch an initiative that ensures continued access. And recognizing the difficulty that early stage climate tech startups face in securing insurance, the nonprofit GreenRE Coalition and the philanthropic funder Trellis Climate partnered to create a new type of bond tailored to the needs of climate tech startups.

Whether it will all be enough to accelerate or even sustain much-needed momentum in climate tech funding is impossible to predict. But at least the private sector seems to agree that, in this moment, good old teamwork is worth one heck of a try.

While Vought did not refer to the government shutdown specifically in his announcement, the timing is, shall we say, noteworthy, not least because the Democrats’ two top congressional negotiators — Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer — are both from New York. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy later made the link explicit, clarifying in a statement that the real issue with the two projects was a recently released rule — as in, published on Tuesday — “barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants.”

There would be a review of the two projects “to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring,” Duffy said, and “until USDOT’s quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed.” Those reviews “will take more time” thanks to the shutdown, he wrote, reaching his denouement, as “without a budget, the Department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review.”

The politics behind this gambit are obvious. President Trump has consistently threatened to withhold funding from states, cities, and institutions controlled by or connected to his political opponents.

“I think they very much understand the political dynamics of trying to make an example of New York. They understand where Chuck Schumer lives,” Jackson Moore-Otto, transportation fellow at the Center for Public Enterprise, told me.

The White House wasn’t exactly running away from the political implications of the denial of funding on Wednesday.Vice President J.D. Vance arched a metaphorical eyebrow during a press conference, saying that “I'm sure that Russ is heartbroken about the fact that he is unable to give certain things to certain constituencies.”

Trump has also specifically threatened federal funding for New York City if Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani wins the upcoming mayoral election.

Duffy himself could not have been any more obvious about what he is trying to achieve by slowing down this funding. “This is another unfortunate casualty of radical Democrats’ reckless decision to hold the federal government hostage to give illegal immigrants benefits,” his statement said, while also specifically calling out the two Democratic congressional leaders, saying that the delayed review was “thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jefferies [sic] shutdown.”

The legality of this — and its legitimate connection to the shutdown — is not so clear.

“It’s pure political maneuvering if you read the statement closely,” David Super, a law professor at Georgetown, told me. “They’re trying to blame the shutdown for slowing their review, but they’re also effectively saying that they’re considering New York in violation of their standards.”

Super also flagged several constitutional and legal issues with the action.

“The funding allocated through laborious means to the Hudson tunnel and Second Avenue Subway is a property right that entities in New York have,” he told me. “The idea that that can be interfered with because someone wants to do an investigation is a blatant violation of due process.”

While it is possible that purported civil rights violations could lead to funding being blocked, “that would have to be established through procedure, not suspicions that they’re doing something wrong,” Super said.

The new rule Duffy referenced addresses a specific set of programs established under the Small Business Act that are designed to give organizations controlled by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,” i.e. “women and members of certain racial and ethnic groups,” a shot at winning government contracts.

The DOT argues that under these programs, “two similarly situated small business owners may face different standards for entering the program, based solely on their race, ethnicity, or sex,” and that the rules and legislation defining them violate equal protection as set out in recent federal court decisions and Trump executive orders.

The rule that Duffy cites as justification for his actions is itself constitutionally suspect, Super said. “The Administrative Procedure Act requires public comment on new rules, subject to limited exceptions,” which this did not have.

The slapdash way the rule has been rolled out could open up the DOT to lawsuits, whether from the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees the New York City subway, or another entity involved with the Hudson tunnel project.

“Courts throughout history have insisted public comment is important,” Super said. The DOT is “violating procedures for issuing this policy and violating due process in the way they apply it.”

Moore-Otto also pointed out that the DOT release makes no specific claim that these projects are violating the rule.

“What they’re saying, it appears to me, is, New York might be doing this thing that we’ve just decided is illegal and we’re going to cut off your funding and it’s going to take longer because our lawyers aren’t being paid,” he said.

And there are broader issues around infrastructure policy at play beyond the obvious political gamesmanship, Moore-Otto pointed out. Duffy’s announcement links the supposedly unconstitutional women and minority contracting practices to the high costs that plague American infrastructure projects, saying they’re a “waste of taxpayer resources.”

But, Moore-Otto argued, what really ails U.S. infrastructure projects are extensive administrative reviews and the start-stop nature of project development.

“I think people would broadly agree the U.S. takes too much time and money to deliver infrastructure projects, and they are trying to invoke this as a pretext,” Moore-Otto said. “What strikes me as noteworthy is that when we look at why the U.S. does, in fact, take so long and use so much money building, while the rest of the world builds faster and cheaper, is that there’s a lot of stopping and starting of these infrastructure projects.”

“Assuming it’s a prolonged delay, it’s going to probably drive up costs — even though they’re saying it is a cost saving measure,” Moore-Otto added. “I think that should not be lost on anybody.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY5MjM2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5Njg2NTQxOH0.jSincWwC74Jrvcdup1GjXLhMkS7Up9_zu8MDeymAzlU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-02 18:02:50.063512

To keep up, Entergy Texas is moving forward with a major transmission project while also leveraging grant funding from the Texas Energy Fund to strengthen the grid and improve resiliency across its service territory.

Today, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the Southeast Texas Area Reliability Project, better known as SETEX, and determined the route on which Entergy Texas is to build the transmission line. Additionally, the company was also awarded approximately $200 million from the Texas Energy Fund that will enable Entergy Texas to execute projects that will bolster grid resilience by upgrading and replacing equipment across the electrical system while prioritizing customer affordability. Together, these initiatives represent significant steps toward delivering reliable, affordable energy to meet the state’s growing needs.

“Receiving approval for a major transmission project and critical state funding demonstrates to our customers our commitment to further strengthen reliability and resiliency while staying focused on affordability,” said Eliecer Viamontes, CEO of Entergy Texas. “Growth in Southeast Texas is creating incredible opportunities for the communities we serve, and it’s our responsibility to ensure we build a resilient power grid that supports long-term economic expansion and future energy needs.”

Southeast Texas Area Reliability Project (SETEX)

The SETEX transmission line is a key part of the company’s Southeast Texas Energy Plan, also known as STEP Ahead, and includes a new 500-kilovolt transmission line connecting two new stations: Babel Switching Station in Newton County and Running Bear Substation in Montgomery County. The transmission line will span 145 miles through Jasper, Montgomery, Newton, Polk, San Jacinto, Trinity, Tyler and Walker counties.

Here’s how the project benefits customers and communities:

Builds new transmission infrastructure needed to deliver reliable power to fast-growing communities

Strengthens the grid and reduces the risk of widespread outages during extreme weather events like hurricanes or winter storms

Helps communities attract new employers, expand the local economy and create jobs

Improves service across the broader Midcontinent Independent System Operator transmission network, supporting reliability across the broader region

Meets federally required North American Electric Reliability Corporation reliability standards, ensuring long-term stability for customers

While the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, serves most Texans, Entergy Texas operates within MISO, a regional transmission organization that oversees energy planning across 15 U.S. states and Manitoba, Canada. SETEX was identified through MISO’s long-range planning process as critical to ensuring compliance with NERC baseline reliability standards and the provision of reliable and cost-effective service as demand continues to grow.

Field surveys for SETEX will begin in the coming months. Final engineering and materials procurement will be a focus in 2026, followed by construction of the new line and substations starting in 2027. The project is expected to be fully energized by the end of 2029. View the transmission route and learn more about the SETEX Area Reliability Project at EntergyTexas.com/transmission/setex.

Texas Energy Fund

Earlier this year, Phase I of the company’s Future Ready Resilience Plan was approved, and Entergy Texas has since pursued opportunities to obtain state grant funding to offset the cost of similar investments for customers. Today, the PUCT awarded Entergy Texas approximately $200 million from the Texas Energy Fund to bolster grid resilience and reliability across our service territory. This is another key milestone to achieving two steps of the company’s Southeast Texas Energy Plan, keeping electric rate’s affordable and protecting the power grid from extreme weather.

With these funds, the company will implement upgrades and replacements across the electrical system to improve resiliency and reliability – decreasing the number of customers impacted and the duration of outages following extreme events.

At no added cost to customers, over 9,000 structures and approx. 400 line-miles of transmission and distribution will be hardened, which are designed to prevent, withstand and mitigate the risks posed by hurricanes, ice storms, wildfires and other severe events.

Phillip Golden, chairman of the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, a group of over 20 of the largest businesses in the state whose members employ tens of thousands of Illinois taxpayers, warned against rushing through the agreement in the next two weeks.

“Trying to pass an 800-page bill impacting the pocketbooks of every citizen and business in Illinois during a 6-day veto session is callous, especially given that its proponents changed the effective date until June of next year to reduce the number of votes they’ll need for adoption.”

The IIEC has been reaching out to proponents of the bill who have been unwilling to engage until recently.

“From the start, we have advocated for an all of the above energy strategy, including battery storage, renewables, nuclear, and natural gas, among other technologies, to create an affordable, reliable, sustainable, and equitable future,” Golden explained.

“The General Assembly owes it to ratepayers to thoughtfully consider this proposal before imposing what is essentially a 20-year tax on ratepayers.”

“The General Assembly rightly tabled this issue at the end of May. However, the current bill is essentially the same as the bill that was tabled and only guarantees immediate cost increases in exchange for the hope of possible savings years down the road. With an effective date of next year, we have the time to avoid mistakes made in other energy markets.”

“States like New York, Massachusetts, and California, among others, have adopted similar top-down battery storage programs. Consumers in those states pay rates that are up to twice as high as Illinois consumers pay today,” Golden said.

Attached is a chart showing the huge differences in costs between Illinois and the nine states that have approved similar battery storage legislation.

IIEC is a coalition of energy-intensive industries and institutions across Illinois. United by a shared interest in energy policy and advocating for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy supply, the IIEC actively engages in utility regulation and legislative initiatives at both the state and regional levels on behalf of energy consumers. The organization also serves as a central hub for tracking and responding to developments that impact utility ratepayers and its members.

The Endangerment Finding established the scientific and legal basis requiring Clean Air Act regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to protect public health and welfare, and it underpins most US climate rules. Depending on EPA’s final approach, the rescission could impact regulations far beyond motor vehicle emissions.

The EPA proposal ignores decades of comprehensive, peer-reviewed science and relies almost exclusively on a draft report from the Department of Energy’s ‘Climate Working Group’, a since-disbanded group of five climate skeptics who do not represent scientific consensus. In their chapter on agriculture, the report’s authors go so far as to claim that “there is reason to conclude that on balance climate change has been and will continue to be neutral or beneficial for most US agriculture.”

The reality of farming in the United States tells a different story. Climate change is already disrupting agricultural production across most major crops and regions.

Due to climate change and depending on the region, farmers and farmworkers nationwide face:

Unprecedented heat and drought that have led to crop and livestock stresses, yield losses, and depleted surface and groundwater resources;

More intense weather and changing precipitation patterns, heavy rains, hurricane winds, and floods, as well as increasing pest pressures;

Decrease in quality and availability of forage; and

Rising hospitalizations and fatalities from heat and more airborne pollution (including wildfire smoke). These hazards disproportionately affect the 3 million farmworkers who do two-thirds of the labor to put food on American tables.

The EPA’s rationale contradicts both established science and farmers’ on-the-ground reality.

Tate: I was surprised to see West Virginia is one of the top 10 states for job growth in clean energy.
That’s the biggest part of the clean energy sector nationally, and I believe, also in West Virginia.
And I can tell you that the sun doesn’t shine any brighter in North Carolina than it does in West Virginia.
I don’t know if you have seen our Clean Energy Project Tracker, but you know, there’s been 400 major clean energy projects announced all over the country.","President Donald Trump’s energy policy leans heavily on fossil fuels and dials back the growth in renewables.

Yet West Virginia is one of the nation’s top states in the growth of clean energy jobs.

Curtis Tate spoke with Bob Keefe, the executive director of E2, a group that supports clean energy development, about what recent changes mean for the state and country.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: I was surprised to see West Virginia is one of the top 10 states for job growth in clean energy.

Keefe: As you saw from our numbers, there’s more than almost 11,000 people, 11,000 West Virginians that now work in clean energy one way or another in that state. And that’s energy efficiency. It’s not necessarily that the typical solar panel installer or the wind turbine guy, right? These are energy efficiency jobs, folks making what I believe is one of the oldest housing stocks in the country, in West Virginia, more efficient and saving consumers money on their power bill every year. That’s the biggest part of the clean energy sector nationally, and I believe, also in West Virginia.

But it is solar workers. You had three or four major solar plants open up just in the past six, eight months, in the past year anyway, in places like in Berkeley County, where a new solar plant just opened up on land that I think was formerly a storage site for coal ash.

You got factory workers at places like Form Energy in Weirton, which obviously is a big deal – 450 or so workers now making next generation batteries and what used to be a shuttered steel mill. Just like the rest of the country, these jobs are growing. They’re growing faster than the economy generally.

Tate: The governor wants to expand energy production with fossil fuels and nuclear. He didn’t mention renewables.

Keefe: Which is unfortunate. When you look across the country, 90% of all new power that was added onto the grid last year was solar, wind and batteries. This is where the country’s moving. This is where the world’s moving. I don’t live in West Virginia. I lived in North Carolina for a long time, one of the biggest solar states in the country. I grew up there. And I can tell you that the sun doesn’t shine any brighter in North Carolina than it does in West Virginia. And there’s no reason that the governor needs to continue to tie the energy sources for West Virginians to what has become the most expensive power available.

Tate: Form is building batteries in Weirton. Aren’t those becoming a bigger part of the grid?

Keefe: It’s getting better every day thanks to innovation at companies like Form. I know it’s probably a dirty word, but I’ll bring up California. California now gets about 60% of all of its energy from renewables and batteries on a daily basis. There are many days when the state produces more than 100% energy from solar, wind, and batteries keep the lights on at night.

This is that we’re talking about the fourth biggest economy in the world, in California, and they’re doing it by not adding gas, not adding nukes, not adding coal. They’re doing it strictly through renewables. Look at other countries. They’re doing the same thing. There are other states. Look at Texas. Texas is the number one wind state in the country. I think it’s about to be the number one solar state in the country. It’s also going to be the number one state for battery deployment. There should be nothing political or partisan about creating jobs, driving economic growth and producing cheaper, cleaner energy.

Tate: What’s happening in the rest of the world, especially China?

Keefe: China is adding more clean energy than any place in the world right now. They’re exporting more clean energy products than any place in the world right now. Right now, 90% or so of all solar panels come from China and a few other countries. 90% of all batteries come from China and a few other countries. Finally, America is getting in the game, and it’s happening right there in West Virginia. We’ve got companies like Form that are creating new batteries across the country in the past three years.

I don’t know if you have seen our Clean Energy Project Tracker, but you know, there’s been 400 major clean energy projects announced all over the country. Form there in West Virginia, but certainly battery factories across the country. I think there’s 50 or 60 battery plants that have been announced. There’s 60 solar panel factories that have been announced. There’s 120 electric vehicle related factories that have been announced. This is how America gets back in the game.

Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.

But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice.

The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles — the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s.

“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners.

Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.

“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”

This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs.

“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away — whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”

And ironically, their new community — dubbed New Isle — could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass.

What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan — paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill — designed to shore up the coastline.

And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them.

In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way — and “limited” funds to do so.

Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10% of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.

In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction — and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds.

Relocation causes rift

Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, Louisiana, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.

“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included.

The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state.

Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a ""significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders.

“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn't really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn't have a say.”

But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials — despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk — “were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders, who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts.

Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s OCD, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”

McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.

“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”

Louisiana: Leader in severe flood risk

Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years.

Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration.

Louisiana’s coast contains 40% of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms.

For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it.

The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.

Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area.

But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”

CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”

Owners report leaking doors, broken appliances

The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities.

“We knew the money that was awarded wasn't going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters, the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.

One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.

Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned.

And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs.

“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”

She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all. They just washed their hands of us.”

Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it.

“You know, that's a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that's almost impossible.”

In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-driven relocation touted

University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.

“It's about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn't viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people's options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”

Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise.

They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.”

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline:

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.

“True management would mean we're thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We're going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

‘This conversation is hardly happening’

Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning.

When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”

“It's hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It's even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that's just as true for government officials.”

Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.

For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!”

Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.

There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive?

“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”

At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started.

But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office.

Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response.

“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they're going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High insurance costs driving coastal retreat

And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners — yet — the cost of insurance might be.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out.

“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what's coming at us and they're saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we're outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now.

Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can — or should — stay.

“The fact that it's going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn't like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything's back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.”

Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable.

“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.”

“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it's too late.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f72a722/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4301+0+582/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F88%2F1e%2Faa5b6e324dcc85e82d110b2a3c14%2F062525-basinger-louisiana-123.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:02:36.520454

(Reuters) - announced record quarterly deliveries on Thursday, but concerns that an expiration of the U.S. tax credit for EVs would turn a rush of buying into a trickle weighed on its shares.

The Elon Musk-led carmaker went all in to drive sales before the withdrawal of the $7,500 federal tax credit, using a combination of discounts, financing deals, social media ads and customer emails.

""I’m skeptical that this will be sustainable and I think we could see a soft couple of quarters,"" said Elliot Johnson, chief investment officer at Evolve ETFs, which manages investments in Tesla.

The sales surge reflected pulled-forward demand, possibly to lock in incentives, rather than growing consumer interest, Johnson said, adding it would not be irrational for investors to ""sell the news"" and buy again next year.

Tesla shares were down 3.4% in afternoon trading. The stock has rallied recently - up nearly 14% this year as of Wednesday’s close - after the company’s board proposed a mega pay package for Musk, who has also bought more shares.

Tesla, like its rivals, received the credits from the government and used them to offer attractive leases. Following the expiry, Tesla has raised lease prices for its vehicles. The prices of Tesla vehicles, excluding the credit, remained unchanged.

On Thursday, the company said it delivered 497,099 vehicles for the three months ended September, up 7.4% from 462,890 a year earlier, and well above Wall Street expectations of 443,919 vehicles.

The deliveries included 481,166 Model 3 compact sedans and its best-selling Model Y crossovers. The carmaker is set to report quarterly results on October 22.

Strong demand for its refreshed Model Y helped sales in China, said Troy Teslike, an independent Tesla researcher.

It also began delivering the six-seat Model Y L in China in September, a family-focused variant aimed at boosting demand in the world’s largest EV market.

Europe, however, remained a weak spot as rivals aggressively promoted plug-in hybrids, while Chinese EV brands started gaining ground in the hyper-competitive market.

The company’s European sales, including the UK, fell 22.5% from a year earlier in August, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the region’s Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

Tesla’s full-year 2025 deliveries are projected to be about 1.61 million, roughly 10% below 2024, according to Visible Alpha. Tesla will need to deliver 389,498 vehicles in the December quarter to meet that projection.

Meanwhile, smaller rival on Thursday lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast, but beat estimates for quarterly deliveries owing to a boost in demand from buyers rushing to take advantage of tax credits.

MUSK AND TESLA

Tesla holdings account for the bulk of Musk’s wealth and a recent surge in the company’s stock price helped his net worth breach the $500 billion mark on Wednesday, bolstering his position as the world’s richest person.

The company’s board has proposed a shareholder vote on a new CEO award that could grant Musk about 12% of the company, worth up to $1 trillion, if performance and valuation targets are met, including delivering 20 million vehicles over a 10-year period.

The billionaire has been positioning Tesla more as a technology company than an EV maker by focusing on AI-based self-driving systems, robotaxis and humanoid robots.

CHEAPER MODELS

Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the U.S., pushing the timing by several months, with an eventual plan to build the variant in China and Europe.

Tesla said in June that it had made ""first builds"" of the vehicle, but would start selling it in the fourth quarter and ramp up output slower than planned.

Analysts said Tesla’s ability to cushion a post-credit slowdown will depend heavily on its push into lower-priced models.

""The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.

The stripped-down version is designed to be roughly 20% cheaper to produce than the refreshed Model Y and could scale to about 250,000 units a year in the U.S. by 2026, sources told Reuters earlier this year.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXNPEL910JE_L.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:21.959629

Specifically, the Biden EPA required that all new home air conditioning systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 use agency-approved refrigerants that are supposedly climate friendlier than the ones that had been in use.
Similarly, the proposed rule extends the installed date deadlines for other categories of air conditioning and refrigeration systems, such as the equipment used in supermarkets.","The Biden administration inflicted many bad appliance regulations on homeowners, but the costliest of them all was an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule requiring that new home air conditioning systems meet certain environmental requirements. Installers say these climate rules have boosted the cost of a residential system by an average of $1,500, and that is on top of other federal regulations that have also raised air conditioning prices in recent years. Fortunately, the EPA has proposed a rule that would provide some relief, but additional steps may also be necessary.

Like many other regrettable regulations of recent vintage, the air conditioner provisions were part of the climate change agenda. Specifically, the Biden EPA required that all new home air conditioning systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 use agency-approved refrigerants that are supposedly climate friendlier than the ones that had been in use. Since cooling equipment is engineered around the refrigerant, this necessitated a redesign of these systems. And, since the new refrigerants are considered mildly flammable, the change requires additional precautions during the installation process that add further to total bill. Making matters worse, one of the new and supposedly eco-friendlier refrigerants, R-454B, was in short supply and prices have skyrocketed, making last summer a particularly painful one for homeowners who needed to replace their air conditioning systems.

While the Biden EPA rule explicitly forbids the manufacture of the cheaper but supposedly less climate-friendly cooling systems as of January 1, 2025, it did allow equipment made before the deadline to be sold and installed up to one year after it. The proposed new rule would extend this deadline indefinitely. Similarly, the proposed rule extends the installed date deadlines for other categories of air conditioning and refrigeration systems, such as the equipment used in supermarkets.

This is a step in the right direction, but there are questions as to just how much of the legally produced pre-2025 equipment is still available. Indeed, there were signs that supplies of such systems were already in short supply during last summer. That is why additional steps may be needed to more fully protect homeowners against regulatory costs. This could include changing the deadline to allow additional manufacturing of the less expensive systems, as well as measures to alleviate refrigerant shortages.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1409343527-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:37.602367

In the 1980s, the globe averaged two of these catastrophic fires a year and a few times hit four a year.
We’ve also got a strong trend of those conditions becoming more common as a result of climate change.
But those factors are harder to quantify compared to climate change, he said.","Washington — Earth’s nastiest and costliest wildfires are blazing four times more often now than they did in the 1980s because of human-caused climate change and people moving closer to wildlands, a new study found.

A study in the journal Science looks at global wildfires, not by acres burned which is the most common measuring stick, but by the harder to calculate economic and human damage they cause. The study concluded there has been a “climate-linked escalation of societally disastrous wildfires.”

A team of Australian, American and German fire scientists calculated the 200 most damaging fires since 1980 based on the percentage of damage to the country's Gross Domestic Product at the time, taking inflation into account. The frequency of these events has increased about 4.4 times from 1980 to 2023, said study lead author Calum Cunningham, a pyrogeographer at the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania in Australia.

“It shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that we do have a major wildfire crisis on our hands,” Cunningham said.

About 43% of the 200 most damaging fires occurred in the last 10 years of the study. In the 1980s, the globe averaged two of these catastrophic fires a year and a few times hit four a year. From 2014 to 2023, the world averaged nearly nine a year, including 13 in 2021. It noted that the count of these devastating infernos sharply increased in 2015, which “coincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions.” Though the study date ended in 2023, the last two years have been even more extreme, Cunningham said.

Europe and North America lead in the number of these economically damaging fires. It's especially worse in the Mediterranean around Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal and in the Western United States around California, because of the climate prone to sudden dryness, worsened by global warming, Cunningham said.

The researchers also found a tripling in how often a single fire killed at least 10 people, such as 2018's Paradise fire, 2023's Lahaina fire and those in Los Angeles in 2025.

Cunningham said often researchers look at how many acres a fire burns as a measuring stick, but he called that flawed because it really doesn't show the effect on people, with area not mattering as much as economics and lives. Hawaii's Lahaina fire wasn't big, but it burned a lot of buildings and killed a lot of people so it was more meaningful than one in sparsely populated regions, he said.

“We need to be targeting the fires that matter. And those are the fires that cause major ecological destruction because they’re burning too intensely,” Cunningham said.

But economic data is difficult to get with many countries keeping that information private, preventing global trends and totals from being calculated. So Cunningham and colleagues were able to get more than 40 years of global economic date from insurance giant Munich Re and then combine it with the public database from International Disaster Database, which isn't as complete but is collected by the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.

The study looked at “fire weather” which is hot, dry and windy conditions that make extreme fires more likely and more dangerous and found that those conditions are increasing, creating a connection to the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

“We’ve firstly got that connection that all the disasters by and large occurred during extreme weather. We’ve also got a strong trend of those conditions becoming more common as a result of climate change. That’s indisputable,” Cunningham said. “So that’s a line of evidence there to say that climate change is having a significant effect on at least creating the conditions that are suitable for a major fire disaster.”

If there was no human-caused climate change, the world would still have devastating fires, but not as many, he said: “We’re loading the dice in a sense by increasing temperatures.”

There are other factors. People are moving closer to fire-prone areas, called the wildland-urban interface, Cunningham said. And society is not getting a handle on dead foliage that becomes fuel, he said. But those factors are harder to quantify compared to climate change, he said.

""This is an innovative study in terms of the data sources employed, and it mostly confirms common sense expectations: fires causing major fatalities and economic damage tend to be those in densely populated areas and to occur during the extreme fire weather conditions that are becoming more common due to climate change,"" said Jacob Bendix, a geography and environment professor at Syracuse University who studies fires, but wasn't part of this research team.

Not only does the study makes sense, but it's a bad sign for the future, said Mike Flannigan, a fire researcher at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Flannigan, who wasn't part of research, said: ""As the frequency and intensity of extreme fire weather and drought increases the likelihood of disastrous fires increases so we need to do more to be better prepared.""","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/02/PDTN/86482039007-ap-25275632106981.jpg?crop=5399,3037,x0,y281&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-02 17:02:51.420905

Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades.","The Department of Energy is cancelling more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.

The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a government shutdown and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought posted on the social media site X that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Energy Department said in a news release that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""

The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:

Clean Energy Demonstrations, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

Grid Deployment, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure

Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security

Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies

Fossil Energy, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.

Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.

""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, posted on X.

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.

Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought announced the funding freeze in a post on X.

Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, said on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.

The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to limit the construction of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they can be built quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

""Ripping funding away from only blue states will raise utility bills for EVERYONE,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, posted on X. ""It's not rocket science.""

### About Austin Watershed Protection Austin Watershed Protection protects lives, property, and the environment of our community by reducing the impact of flooding, erosion, and water pollution.
About Texas Water Development Board The Texas Water Development Board is the state agency charged with collecting and disseminating water-related data, assisting with regional water and flood planning, and preparing the state water and flood plans.","Austin, TX – Austin Watershed Protection’s Rain Catcher Pilot Program was honored with the 2025 Texas Rain Catcher Award in the governmental category by the Texas Water Development Board. This award recognizes the program’s success in installing over 300 green infrastructure features across 40 residential properties in North Central Austin. The award was presented at the Texas Water Development Board meeting on Oct. 2, 2025, followed by a reception for winners.

“The Rain Catcher Pilot Program shows how small-scale, community-based solutions make an impact,” said Watershed Protection Manager, Jessica Wilson.

The Rain Catcher Pilot Program ended in January 2025 with the installation of 117 large cisterns, 65 rain gardens, and 124 rainwater irrigated street trees across residential properties. These systems can collectively capture up to 185,000 gallons of rainwater per storm, helping reduce erosion and ponding while improving creek baseflow. The program focused on a 1.08-square-mile area in North Central Austin, located in the upper portion of the Waller Creek Watershed. This urban neighborhood, with 46% impervious cover, was developed before Austin’s watershed protection regulations were in place and lacked space for large-scale green stormwater infrastructure. This program brought meaningful water quality and stormwater benefits to an area that lacked such protections during its original development.

“By working across City departments, partnering with a nonprofit and researchers, and engaging our community, we were able to turn rainwater from a problem into a resource to improve creek health, conserve water, cool our city, and build stronger neighborhoods along the way,” said Environmental Officer Liz Johnston. She added, “The actions that individuals take matter. Program participants now have a deeper understanding of their role in making Austin a more livable and resilient city.”

In addition to improving watershed health, the Rain Catcher Pilot Program contributed to water conservation, alternative water sources during outages, increased tree canopy, enhanced wildlife habitat, and stronger neighborhood connections. It also encouraged residents to view rainwater as a resource, not runoff. The program was administered by Austin Watershed Protection and developed in collaboration with Urban Patchwork and community partners. Austin Water and Austin Development Services provided support and additional funding to reduce the cost for residents adding a rain garden or cistern to their properties.

With the current shutdown of the U.S. government, key climate and environmental programs have been halted. The Environmental Protection Agency is the most severely affected, with nearly 90% of its staff being furloughed. This means regulatory work, research, and public updates have been paused indefinitely. Another affected agency is the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). NFIP, which insures 4.7 million properties, cannot issue new policies or renewals, threatening real estate transactions and leaving homeowners vulnerable. Due to public safety needs, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will continue forecasting, but all nonessential research has been suspended. While no agencies have expressed plans for layoffs, President Trump has threatened mass firings.

This politicization of essential environmental services and threats of layoffs is damaging to regulatory stability, public trust, and long-term climate resilience in the United States and beyond. Stalling critical climate research and regulation could have serious repercussions in a time of increased climate risk.

Omnibus agreement fails in European Parliament ahead of mid-October vote

The intended last round of discussions for the sustainability Omnibus took place on Tuesday. After tense negotiations, members of the European Parliament failed to reach an agreement. The primary issues under discussion include liability under the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), corporate regulations, and climate transition plans. Jörgen Warborn, Swedish member of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and lead negotiator, presented two packages. The first would raise the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and eliminate obligatory climate transition plans. This package has received the backing of the far-right. In the second package, the scope of CSRD would remain for companies with 1,000 employees, but compulsory implementation of CSDDD transition plans would be discarded. Warborn said that his goal “has always been to simplify and cut cost for businesses.” The vote is set to take place on Tuesday, 13 October, provided that Parliament’s position is filed by 8 October.

Renewable energy surplus attracts cryptocurrency miners to Brazil

With the country’s surplus in renewable power, cryptocurrency mining companies are looking to Brazil to begin mining projects. For a crypto transaction to be processed, complex mathematical problems must be solved on mining machines that have been known to overload grids worldwide. With minimal crypto mining and a surplus of energy, Brazil is an ideal location for crypto miners to focus their efforts. Cryptocurrency companies like Tether and Enegix are negotiating deals with Renova Energia and other Brazilian energy companies. Renova informed Reuters that it is launching a $200 million, 100 megawatt (MW) wind-powered mining operation in the northeast of Brazil. Despite these opportunities, challenges remain, including water scarcity, regulatory gaps, and inadequate infrastructure. Companies that wish to make smart and sustainable investment decisions should consider ESG solutions for guidance.

European Union to raise tariffs and cut quotas on steel

According to industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, the EU plans to decrease foreign steel import quotas by nearly 50% and significantly raise tariffs. These measures aim to protect the struggling steel industry by countering subsidized steel from Asia and North Africa. The U.S. and Canada have also begun similar measures, charging 50% tariffs on imported steel. The steel industry has requested 50% tariffs on any imports above the proposed quotas. The European Parliament and EU Member States must approve the plan. Séjourné urged industry workers and unions to back the proposal as he expects opposition from minority interests. Corporations can use ESG solutions to navigate the ever-changing landscape of regulations.

Data centers and supporting industries regularly use PFAS gases, or f-gases as refrigerants used to cool electronics.
The EPA said in its release that the program is intended to “reduce the backlog” of new chemicals, but data centers are being built and are operating without these compounds.","The Trump administration has begun prioritizing the review of new, potentially hazardous chemicals used in data centers that public health advocates and environmental attorneys warn could endanger workers, communities and the environment.

While the Environmental Protection Agency, which made the announcement last month, has prioritized new chemical reviews for some industries in the past, advocates said the new EPA effort and an accompanying executive order, “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure,” signed by President Trump go well beyond data centers and benefit the fossil fuel, nuclear and semiconductor industries, among others.

They include what advocates said is unprecedented language that calls for the EPA to “ease” and “reduce” regulations.

“We inherited a massive backlog of new chemical reviews from the Biden Administration, which is getting in the way of projects as it pertains to data center and artificial intelligence projects,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in announcing the fast-track chemical review. “The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works.”

The EPA’s language is “hugely broad” and “shocking,” said Maria Doa, chemical policy director with the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

“I don’t think we’ve seen this blatant language before,” Doa said. “The EPA said it is going to ‘Get out of the way,’ not ‘The EPA is going to do a thorough but expedited review.’”

That could have wide-reaching consequences. “It would affect not only the communities around the data centers but the workers and other communities that are making the components for the data centers,” Doa said.

Big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon need data centers—typically warehouse-sized facilities filled with computer servers, data storage drives and other network equipment—to process the world’s digital traffic and meet the extraordinary computational demands of the artificial intelligence boom, which is driving demand for more facilities.

Data centers also consume high levels of energy, water—and chemicals. Public health advocates are only now beginning to understand that data centers are a source of chemical pollution, especially from PFAS, so-called “forever chemicals,” which are used to cool some facilities. PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 16,000 chemicals, and many are linked to cancer and a range of serious health risks.

Data centers and supporting industries regularly use PFAS gases, or f-gases as refrigerants used to cool electronics. Though f-gases are generally less toxic than some other PFAS, there is very little health and safety information for most, and that which does exist still points to concerning toxicity. Some f-gases are also potent greenhouse gases.

In a statement sent to Inside Climate News, the EPA defended the program. “Nothing in EPA’s announcement suggests that the agency intends to use this effort to circumvent the law,” a spokesperson wrote. “This is a ridiculous claim made by special interest groups in an attempt to distract from the work the Trump administration is doing to make our work more efficient and make our country the AI capital of the world.”

The EPA’s move to prioritize approval of new chemicals used in data centers comes as local communities mobilize to thwart proposed data center projects. Across Michigan, advocates are working to derail, or have derailed, plans for at least seven centers. Residents fear impact on their utility bills, climate impacts, changes to their communities’ rural characters and pollution from diesel generators. The chemical pollution, often through wastewater discharges, adds a new layer.

Meanwhile, Michigan has identified over 300 sites contaminated with PFAS and is struggling to address those and rein in pollution in its surface and groundwater.

“We’re adding new sources of potential contamination before we even have a grasp on the extent of the impact of how the PFAS already here are impacting the environment and our bodies,” said Tim Minotas, Sierra Club Michigan’s legislative director. “If the EPA is going to be speeding up these reviews for new chemicals, some fluorinated without any sort of safeguard, then the risk is going to land on residents.”

“Incredibly Dangerous”

Newly developed chemicals that industry wants to use are subjected to environmental and health reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and the EPA often imposes restrictions on those that create an “unreasonable risk.” The process can take months, and new chemical reviews occur in “blackbox,” advocates say.

In announcing its expedited chemical review for data centers, the EPA said that it facilitated Trump’s vision of AI at the heart of a “hypercompetitive global race” and was “focused on strengthening America’s energy foundation and ensuring our nation remains the global leader in AI and the infrastructure that powers it.”

Trump’s executive order covers broad swaths of multiple industries, and could include chemicals used for transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, substations, switchyards, transformers, natural gas turbines, coal power equipment, nuclear power equipment, geothermal power equipment and electrical infrastructure. The order also covers the semiconductor industry, which has been found to pollute air and water with PFAS.

The wording in the executive order and EPA announcement is so broad that it may include suppliers further upstream, and the program’s limits are unclear, advocates said.

“This is really telling industry, ‘Just contrive of any connection between your substance and the vast scope of this program, and you can get prioritized review,’ and I think that is incredibly dangerous,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, an attorney with Earthjustice, which has litigated on EPA new chemical programs.

The EPA said in its release that the program is intended to “reduce the backlog” of new chemicals, but data centers are being built and are operating without these compounds. “There is no demonstrated need for this prioritization,” said Dan Rosenberg, an attorney who litigates on toxic chemical laws for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He noted that the program also comes after the 2016 congressional approval of an update to the Toxic Substances Control Act, which aimed to strengthen the new chemical review process. The Senate unanimously approved the update.

The Trump administration’s actions do the opposite, Rosenberg said, and it is proceeding “as if this broad rhetoric about regulatory relief can somehow override congressional mandates to review chemical safety to protect the public—that’s not how it works.”

“That’s how we got a PFAS crisis in the first place—PFAS zipping through the new chemical program without adequate review or restrictions,” Rosenberg said.

“It Isn’t Just About Fast Tracking”

How the EPA reviews new data center chemicals remains to be seen, advocates said, but the agency has a spotty record when it expedites the process.

During the first Trump administration, the agency permitted industry to utilize a PFAS exemption that allowed the chemicals to be sent to market with little scrutiny in under 30 days, including compounds that were “lethal if inhaled” and “corrosive to the skin.”

When the EPA announced last year that it would fast-track the approval of semiconductor PFAS, it claimed to have put in place a “framework” to ensure the chemicals are safe, but did not provide details. The agency generally uses standardized formulas to assess health and environmental risks that watchdog groups have said are not fully protective, and it relies on industry health and safety data to make decisions.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA announced it would “streamline” biofuel chemical reviews, which the agency touted as a climate solution, even though it included highly toxic chemicals that would be produced by burning plastic waste. The order also covered mixed metal oxides used in batteries, but the scope and thoroughness of the review were “opaque,” Klamuss-Katz said.

The EPA found many of the chemicals created what Kalmuss-Katz characterized as “astronomical risks” to workers and the surrounding neighborhoods near the Louisiana plant that would produce the compounds. Kalmuss-Katz and Earthjustice challenged the approval in court, and EPA announced it would withdraw the chemicals’ approval, though Chevron is still seeking permission to use them.

But the new Trump order is worse because it goes further in scope, Kalmuss-Katz said, and “it isn’t just about fast tracking.”

“The EPA is also making clear it wants to lessen regulations and remove barriers for the chemicals going to market, and when you’re talking about PFAS and other compounds that can cause serious harm—that regulation is what keeps people safe,” Kalmuss-Katz said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226519839-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:42.341350

The Energy Department said on Wednesday night that it would cancel more than $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for hundreds of energy projects, with the vast majority located in states led by Democrats. The move underscored how the Trump administration appeared to be using the government shutdown as a pretext to punish its political opponents.

The White House canceled about $26 billion in previously approved funds for climate and transportation projects, mostly in blue states.

E.P.A. employees left in limbo during the shutdown

On Wednesday, Day 1 of the government shutdown, I wrote about the widespread confusion at the Environmental Protection Agency, where Trump administration officials said they would follow a plan calling for a skeleton crew of agency employees, but then ordered nearly everyone to continue work.

It’s now Day 2 of the shutdown and there’s still little clarity around what funding the agency responsible for protecting America’s air and water is using to keep employees on the job, or how long it will last. Some federal agencies do have balances of appropriated funds that carry over from the previous funding period, but the Trump administration hasn’t confirmed how E.PA. operations are being funded.

One thing that is clear: The longer the shutdown lasts, the more activities will grind to a halt.

When the E.P.A.’s shutdown plan does go into effect, major elements of the agency’s work will cease, including civil enforcement inspections, the on-site visits to chemical facilities and other plants that ensure compliance with environmental regulations. So would the issuance of new contracts and permits.

Cleanup at hazardous waste areas known as Superfund sites would be decided on a case-by-case basis, but would generally only continue in areas where stopping would pose an imminent threat to human life.

Something that could take a serious hit is E.P.A. Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plan to repeal dozens of air, water and climate regulations. Before they are finalized, many of those rollbacks require months of analysis of their economic and health effects. If workers are furloughed, that would be put on hold.

In the meantime, employees at E.P.A. report being in a state of limbo.

Under a plan the Trump administration issued this week, the E.P.A. said it would place about 90 percent of its staff on furlough in the event of a shutdown. But late on Tuesday, hours before the government ran out of money, at least some agency employees received an email saying they “work on activities which currently have funds available” and should report to work as usual.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom's office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancellation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

Stacey Knoll thought the court summons she received was a scam. She didn’t remember getting any medical bills from Montrose Regional Health, a nonprofit hospital, after a 2020 emergency room visit.

So she was shocked when, three years after the trip to the hospital, her employer received court orders requiring it to start funneling a chunk of her paychecks to a debt collector for an unpaid $881 medical bill — which had grown to $1,155.26 from interest and court fees.

The timing was terrible. After leaving a bad marriage and staying in a shelter, she had just gotten full custody of her three children, steady housing in Montrose, Colorado, and a job at a gas station.

“And that’s when I got that garnishment from the court,” she said. “It was really scary. I’d never been on my own or raised kids on my own.”

KFF Health News reviewed 1,200 Colorado cases in which judges, over a two-year period from Feb. 1, 2022, through Feb. 1, 2024, gave permission to garnish wages over unpaid bills. At least 30% of the cases stemmed from medical care — even when patients’ bills should have been covered by Medicaid, the public insurance program for those with low incomes or disabilities. That 30% is likely an underestimate since medical debt is often hidden behind other types of debt, such as from credit cards or payday loans. But even that minimum would translate to roughly 14,000 cases a year in Colorado in which courts approved taking people’s wages because of unpaid medical bills.

Among the other findings:

Patients were pursued for medical bills ranging from under $30 to over $30,000, with most of the bills amounting to less than $2,400. As the cases rolled through the legal system, accumulating interest and court fees, the amount that patients owed often grew by 25%. In one case, it snowballed by more than 400%.

Cases trailed people for up to 14 years after they received medical care, with debt collectors reviving their cases even as they moved from job to job.

Medical providers of all stripes are behind these bills — big health care chains, small rural hospitals, physician groups, public ambulance services, and more. In several cases, hospitals won permission to take the pay of their own employees who had unpaid bills from treatment at the facilities.

Colorado has company. It is one of 45 states that allow wage garnishment for unpaid medical bills. Only Delaware, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas have banned wage garnishment for medical debt.

As KFF Health News has reported, medical debt is devastating for millions of people across the country. And now the problem is likely to grow more pressing nationwide. Millions of Americans are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years due to Medicaid changes in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law and if Congress allows some Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire. That means health crises for the newly uninsured could lead them, too, into a spiral of medical debt.

And the hurt will linger: Large unpaid medical bills are staying on credit reports in most states after a July decision from a federal judge reversed a new rule aimed at protecting consumers.

“If you can't maintain your health, how are you going to work to pay back a debt?” said Adam Fox, deputy director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, a nonprofit aimed at lowering health costs. “And if you fundamentally can't pay the bill, wage garnishment isn't going to help you do that. It's going to put you in more financial distress.”

Flying Blind on Medical Debt

When someone fails to pay a bill, the creditor that provided the service — whether for a garage door repair, a car loan, or medical care — can take the debtor to court. Creditors can also pass the debt to a debt collector or debt buyer, who can do the same.

“At any given point, about 1% of working adults are being garnished for some reason,” said Anthony DeFusco, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who studied paycheck data from ADP, a payroll processor that distributes paychecks to about a fifth of private sector U.S. workers. “That's a big chunk of the population.”

But specific research into the practice of garnishing wages over medical debt is scant. Studies in North Carolina, Virginia, and New York have found that nonprofit hospitals commonly garnish wages from indebted patients, with some studies finding those patients tend to work in low-wage occupations.

Marty Makary, who led research on medical debt wage garnishment in Virginia at Johns Hopkins University before joining Trump’s cabinet as Food and Drug Administration commissioner, has called the practice “aggressive.” He co-authored a study that found 36% of Virginia hospitals, mostly nonprofit and mostly in urban areas, were using garnishment to collect unpaid debts in 2017, affecting thousands of patients.

The Colorado findings from KFF Health News show that hospitals are far from the only medical providers going after patients’ paychecks, though.

Researchers and advocates say that, in addition to a dearth of court case data, another phenomenon tends to obscure how often this happens. “People find debt shameful,” said Lester Bird, a senior manager at the Pew Charitable Trusts who specializes in courts. “A lot of this exists in the shadows.”

Without data on how often this tactic is employed, lawmakers are flying blind — even as a 2024 Associated Press-NORC poll showed about 4 in 5 U.S. adults believe it’s important for the federal government to provide medical debt relief.

‘Blood From a Turnip’

Colorado was among the first of 15 states to scratch medical debt from credit reports. Debt buyers in the state aren’t allowed to foreclose on a patient’s home. If qualified patients opt to pay in monthly installments, those payments shouldn’t exceed 6% of their household income — and the remaining debt gets wiped after about three years of paying.

But if they don’t agree to a payment plan, Coloradans can have up to 20% of their disposable earnings garnished. The National Consumer Law Center gave the state a “D” grade for state protections of family finances.

Consumer advocates said they aren’t sure how well even those Colorado requirements are being followed. And people wrote letters to the courts saying wage garnishment would exacerbate their already dire financial situations.

“I have begun to fall behind on my electricity, my gas, my water my credit cards,” wrote a man in western Colorado in a letter to a judge that KFF Health News obtained in the court filings. Court records show he was working in construction and at a rent-to-own store, with about $8,000 in medical debt. He wrote to the judge that he was paying close to $1,000 a month. “The way things are going now I will lose everything.”

The people being sued in KFF Health News’ Colorado review worked in a wide array of jobs. They worked in school districts, ranching, mining, construction, local government, even health care. Several worked at stores such as Walmart and Family Dollar, or at gas stations, restaurants, or grocery stores.

“You're really kicking people when they're down,” said Lois Lupica, a former attorney working with the Denver-based Community Economic Defense Project and the Debt Collection Lab at Princeton. “They're basically suing the you-can't-get-blood-from-a-turnip population.”

In 2022, court records show, Valley View health system based in Glenwood Springs was allowed to garnish the wages of one of its patients over a $400 medical bill. The patient was working at a local organization that the health system supported as part of the community benefits it provides to keep its tax-exempt status. Nonprofit hospitals like Valley View are required to provide community benefits, which can also include charity care that covers patients’ bills.

Stacey Gavrell, the health system’s chief community relations officer, said it offers options such as interest-free payment plans and care at reduced or no cost to families with incomes up to 500% of the federal poverty level.

“As our rural region’s largest healthcare provider, it is imperative to the health and well-being of our community that Valley View remains a financially viable organization,” she said. “Most of our patients work with us to develop a payment plan or pursue financial assistance.”

The collection agency that took the employee to court, A-1 Collection Agency, advertises itself on its website as empathetic: “We understand times are tough and money is tight.”

Pilar Mank, who oversees operations at A-1’s parent company, Healthcare Management, said it accepts payment plans as small as $50 a month and that most of the hospitals it works with allow it to offer a discount if patients pay all at once.

“Suing a patient is the absolute last resort,” she said. “We try everything we can to work with the patient.”

If you can't maintain your health, how are you going to work to pay back a debt?

Hospitals sometimes also garnish wages from their own employees for care they provided them. In one case, a hospital employee worked her way up from housekeeper to registrar to quality analyst. She even participated in public events representing her employer and appeared on the hospital’s website as a featured employee — while the court issued writs of garnishment until her $10,000 in medical bills from the hospital was paid off.

“Hospital care costs money to deliver,” said Colorado Hospital Association spokesperson Julie Lonborg about hospitals’ garnishing their own employees’ wages. “In some ways, I think it's funny to be asked the question. I would understand if someone said, ‘Why aren't you garnishing their wages?’”

Studies show that hospital debt collection efforts through wage garnishment bring in only about 0.2% of hospital revenues, said April Kuehnhoff, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, which advocates for people with low incomes.

""We also know that there are states that don't allow this at all,” she said. “Hospitals are continuing to provide medical care to consumers.”

Smooth Sailing for Collectors — But Not for Patients

Health care providers appeared as the plaintiffs in only 2% of the medical debt cases. Instead, cases were filed almost entirely by third-party debt collectors and buyers, with BC Services and Professional Finance Company behind more than half of the cases, followed by A-1 Collection Agency and Wakefield & Associates.

Debt buyers make money by buying debt from providers who’ve given up on getting paid then collecting what they can of the money owed, plus interest. Debt collectors get paid a percentage of what they recover. Some companies do a bit of both.

BC Services declined to comment, and Wakefield & Associates did not respond to questions.

Charlie Shoop, president of Professional Finance Company, said his company initiates wage garnishment on less than 1% of all accounts placed with it for collection.

Health care providers in Colorado can no longer hide behind debt collectors’ names when they sue people, according to a 2024 state law prompted by a 9News-Colorado Sun investigation in partnership with a Colorado News Collaborative-KFF Health News reporting project.

In many states, the path for filing a case against a debtor and garnishing their wages is relatively smooth — especially if the debtor doesn’t appear in court.

“It's unbelievably easy,” said Dan Vedra, a lawyer in Colorado who often represents consumers in debt cases. “If you have a word processor and a spreadsheet, you can mass-produce thousands of lawsuits in a matter of hours or minutes.”

Within KFF Health News’ sample, nearly all the medical debt cases were default judgments, meaning the patient did not defend themselves in court or in writing. Missing a court date can happen for a variety of reasons, such as not receiving the notice in the mail, assuming it was a scam, knowingly ignoring it, or not having the time to take off from work.

Vedra and other debt law experts said a high rate of default judgments indicates a system that favors the pursuers over the pursued — and increases the chances someone will be harmed by an erroneous bill.

But in New Hampshire, creditors now have to keep going to court for each paycheck they want to garnish, because the state allows creditors to garnish only wages that have already been earned, said Maanasa Kona, an associate research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

“It might not look like much on paper,” she said. “It's just not worth it if they have to keep going back to court.”

Wrongly Pursued for Bills

The nation’s medical billing setup is already prone to errors due to its complexity, according to Barak Richman, a law professor at George Washington University and a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine who has studied medical debt collection practices in several states. “Bills are not only noncomprehensible, but often wrong,” Richman said.

Indeed, Colorado’s Health Care Policy & Financing Department, which runs Medicaid in the state, said it sent out nearly 11,000 letters in the past fiscal year to health providers and collectors that erroneously went after patients on Medicaid. Bills for Medicaid recipients are supposed to be sent to Medicaid, not the patients, who typically pay a nominal amount, if anything, for their care.

Shoop said his industry has pushed Colorado, without success, for access to a database that would allow them to confirm if patients had Medicaid coverage.

Colorado’s Medicaid program declined to comment.

Patricia DeHerrera in Rifle, Colorado, had to prove that she and her children had Medicaid when they received care at Grand River Health — but only after A-1 contacted her employer at the time, the gas station chain Kum & Go, with court-approved paperwork to take a portion of her paychecks.

She contacted the state, which sent letters to the hospital and the collector notifying them they were engaging in “illegal billing action” and telling the collector to stop. The companies did.

Theresa Wagenman, controller for Grand River Health, said if a patient can present a letter from a Medicaid caseworker saying they’re eligible, then their bills get removed from the collections pipeline. Wagenman also said patients get at least eight letters in the mail and several phone calls before Grand River gives the go-ahead for the collector to send them to court.

DeHerrera’s main advice to others in this situation: “Know your rights. Otherwise, they’re going to take advantage of you.”

Yet fighting back isn’t easy.

Nicole Silva, who lives in the 900-person town of Sanford in south-central Colorado, said she and her family were all on Medicaid when her daughter was in a car crash. Still, court records show, her wages were garnished for a $2,181.60 ambulance ride, which grew to more than $3,000 from court fees and interest.

She tried to prove the bill was wrong, contacting her county’s social services office, but Silva said it wasn’t helpful and she wasn’t able to reach the right person at a state office. The state Medicaid program confirmed to KFF Health News that her daughter was covered at the time of the wreck.

Fighting the bill felt like too much for Silva and her husband to handle while parenting a growing number of kids, one of them severely disabled, and working — she as a preschool teacher and he as a rancher.

Not receiving the roughly $500 a month that she said came out of her pay was enough to affect their ability to pay other bills. “It was deciding to buy groceries or pay the electric bill,” Silva said.

When their electricity got shut off, she said, they had to scramble to borrow money from colleagues and friends to get it turned back on — with an extra fee.

She said the saga makes her hesitant to call an ambulance in the future.

Fox, of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, said consumers often think they cannot do anything to stop their wages from being garnished, but they can contest it in court, for example by pointing out they should have qualified for discounted — or charity — care if the hospital that provided the treatment is a nonprofit.

DeFusco, the economist, believes filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is an underused option for debtors. It halts garnishment in its tracks, though not always permanently, and it comes with other consequences. But he understands it’s a Catch-22: It’s a complex process and typically necessitates hiring a lawyer.

“To get rid of your debt, you need money,” he said. “And the whole reason you're in this situation is because you don't have money.”

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America’s health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump’s boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it’s natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA’s furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet’s air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,” Ruckelshaus said. “Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA’s job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. “Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

WATCH: How a White House plan to overturn a key EPA regulation threatens children’s health

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump’s new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,” followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America’s health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency’s shutdown plan

The EPA’s shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren’t funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won’t say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it’s 25% — but the Trump administration’s budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan’s presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency’s shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,” he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,” said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children’s health protection division.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/2025-01-14T110137Z_1948183175_RC2WTAAPBM30_RTRMADP_3_BERKSHIRE-COAL-POLLUTION-1024x722.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:46.715867

On Oct. 2, the Austin, Texas-based company announced it delivered more than 497,000 vehicles in the 90-day period that ended on Sept. 30. The company said that was a record amount of sales for a quarter. Most deliveries were of the company’s Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers, which together accounted for 481,166 units in the quarter.

The amount of sales was also well ahead of the about 470,000 vehicles the company delivered in the same quarter of the prior year. The sales total was considered to be ahead of Wall Street’s expectations for the third quarter of 2025.

Tesla’s strong performance was in line with industry trends showing exceptionally strong demand for electric vehicles before the program ended. On Sept. 16, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, wrote that total electric vehicle sales in the United States hit a record in August 2025.

Ford, a competitor in the electric vehicle space, reported a similar boost in electric vehicle sales. In a third-quarter sales report it published on Oct. 1, the Dearborn, Michigan, based automaker said its overall electric vehicle sales were up by 19.8 percent in the 90-day period. In a release it called that performance its “best third quarter ever” for electric vehicle sales.

Even with the strong sales performance, investors sent Tesla’s stock price downward on Thursday. As of about midday Eastern time, the price of Tesla’s stock had fallen by about 3 percent to about $446 a share from its opening price of $470.54 a share.

In its Oct. 2 release, Tesla said it is scheduled to release its full third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 22. When it last reported on July 23, it said it was profitable through the first six months of 2025. However, its total net income—or profit—had fallen to about $1.58 billion from about $2.79 billion in the past year.

But the state’s main business-promotion organization praised the report.

The Charlotte-based utility’s biennial “Carolinas Resource Plan” provides insight into how it expects to provide electricity for its nearly 4 million N.C. customers over the next decade. The N.C. Utilities Commission will receive comments on the required plan from a variety of groups over the next three months, then make a ruling late next year.

The NC Chamber notes the plan “projects that future bill impacts will remain below inflation while adding nuclear, natural gas, solar, and storage resources to expand capacity. These priorities closely align with the NC Chamber Foundation’s Business-Driven Energy Vision, which highlights predictable costs, grid resiliency, and an all-of-the-above energy mix as foundations for economic growth.”

Duke’s plan comes amid soaring demand for power. The company expects growth over the next 15 years that is eight times greater than the past 15, mainly because of datacenters needed for artificial intelligence computing.

Much of the environmentalists’ criticism about Duke’s plan involved the proposal to extend the life of its coal-fired plants until 2040, while showing a reduced emphasis on solar energy.

“Duke proposes to greatly increase methane gas for power and experimental nuclear plants while extending its burning of coal for at least 15 years,” according to longtime company critic Jim Warren, executive director of the NC WARN nonprofit in Durham. “The plan slashes projections for large-scale solar and continues its suppression of rooftop solar. This would put billions into the rate system, leading power bills to double or triple over time while driving even more weather disasters that are devastating North Carolina communities.”

At the Southern Environmental Law Center, attorney David Neal said Duke’s plan is too reliant on “expensive new gas power plants, leaving North Carolina families on the hook for escalating fuel costs and making it harder to reach the 2050 carbon neutrality requirement. Duke yet again appears to have fallen short of taking full advantage of energy efficiency, load flexibility, renewables, and storage, which remain the cheapest and fastest suite of options for meeting rising demand.”

The Environmental Defense Fund, the largest U.S. environmental group with more than 3 million members, noted that Duke’s plan “reaffirms that large amounts of solar and battery storage remain the cheapest choice to meet growing demand, even without a short-term battery reduction requirement.”

Continued declines in battery prices could displace Duke’s plans for more natural gas-fired power plants, Will Scott, EDF’s Southeast climate and clean energy director, said in a release.

Duke contends that its proposed generation mix, which calls for additional capacity from nuclear energy starting in 2037 and the addition of several new gas plants, provides the best balance for reliability and affordability. It noted that low energy prices compared with national averages is helping North Carolina attract new employers and investment at a record pace.

Duke’s plan comes as the GOP-led Congress, N.C. General Assembly and the Trump Administration have struck down subsidies that helped make solar and wind power the main source of additional U.S. power generation over the past decade.

Duke is the fourth-largest U.S. electric utility based on market capitalization of $94 billion. Its shares have gained about 66% over the past five years, including reinvested dividends, compared with a 116% gain in the S&P 500 Index.",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BusinessNC_2021_logo_orange.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 15:02:34.604023

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/2025-10-02T180719Z_1450871852_RC2U3HA7OZPI_RTRMADP_3_USA-SHUTDOWN-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:50.642505

A rush to take advantage of a US$7,500 tax credit for EV purchases delivered a temporary boost to Tesla’s core automotive business, which languished for several quarters under the weight of an aging lineup and rising competition. The company also faced a consumer backlash to chief executive Elon Musk’s politics as he worked closely with President Donald Trump early this year.

Article content

Investors recently looked past Tesla’s first-half sales weakness to Musk’s promises of growth in areas such as driverless vehicles, artificial intelligence and robotics. The carmaker’s shares soared 33 per cent in September, recouping early-year losses and adding US$401.9 billion of market value.

The stock gave back some of those gains Thursday, falling as much as 3.2 per cent as of noon New York time.

The phase-out of EV tax credits in the U.S. after Sept. 30 helped drive widespread demand for electric models from the likes of General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. last quarter. Rivian Automotive Inc. also reported better-than-expected vehicle deliveries, though the EV maker narrowed its annual guidance toward the lower end of its prior range.

But questions remain over how development along the Congaree River will balance with environmental protection.
Advocates say the projects could define how Columbia showcases its riverfront for decades to come.
“It’s downtown, and it’s going to be how Columbia really identifies its riverfront moving forward.
Being engaged in that river protection effort is absolutely critical.”","Columbia leaders are preparing to reimagine one of the city’s most visible stretches of downtown riverfront.

But questions remain over how development along the Congaree River will balance with environmental protection.

The city plans to build a new public park alongside the area’s first private development on land between the Gervais and Blossom Street bridges. Advocates say the projects could define how Columbia showcases its riverfront for decades to come.

“This is a very visible stretch of river,” said Bill Stangler, the Congaree Riverkeeper. “It’s downtown, and it’s going to be how Columbia really identifies its riverfront moving forward. So how that gets done is certainly going to be important.”

The city is expected to select a design firm for the park in the coming months. Mayor Daniel Rickenmann has called the project “transformative,” saying it will help Columbia “finally unveil our river” and expand public access beyond canoeing and kayaking.

But with development comes oversight. The South Carolina Department of Environmental Services issues stormwater permits and other reviews to builders to limit pollution from construction. It also will inspect projects for compliance with state and federal protection regulations.

“The most common permits required from our agency for development projects are stormwater permits that limit the stormwater that comes from a construction site and could potentially impact the environment,” said Laura Renwick, the agency’s communications director. “Once a permit is issued, our agency performs inspections to make sure the industry or construction project is meeting the conditions of its permit.”

Renwick said the state also monitors for emerging contaminants such as PFAS, ethylene oxide and harmful algal blooms.

Stangler said those regulatory safeguards are essential. But he urged city leaders to go further by strengthening protections for surrounding properties – riparian buffers, wetlands and floodplains.

“We just need to make sure that the rules we have in place are strong enough to do what our communities want to see happen with these places,” he said. “There are opportunities to improve wetland and floodplain protection to make sure we’re putting the right things in the right places.”

The South Carolina Office of Resilience is also involved. The agency coordinates disaster recovery and preparedness across state government and with local partners. The office will advise developers and municipal officials on how to account for long-term risks such as heavier rainfall, land-use change and flash flooding.

“Development that preserves or enhances the natural function of the flood plain and accounts for future conditions can positively impact the community and economy while protecting the ecosystem functions,” said Kevin O’Dell, public information coordinator with the office.

Sustainable planning for Stangler is about more than rules and permits — it depends on public engagement. He said community advocacy for Columbia’s rivers has grown more vocal in recent years, helping to elevate them as a key part of the city’s identity.

“These rivers belong to each and every one of us,” Stangler said. “But it really matters when people stand up and speak up. Being engaged in that river protection effort is absolutely critical.”",https://carolinanewsandreporter.cic.sc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CNlogo2017-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:41.184478

It is only recently that research on climate change and politicians has started to become a focus of peer-reviewed literature10.
The limited research that exists on parliamentarians’ climate knowledge mostly examines knowledge of climate change’s human causes.
On the case, the UK has historically been an international leader on climate change mitigation.
For anthropogenic climate change belief and climate worry, we use the questions as fielded in the European Social Survey42.","The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports are a mammoth task, involving 782 authors, 66,000 peer-reviewed articles and almost 200,000 review comments1. They aim to provide an authoritative, objective source of information for policymakers on climate change’s causes and effects, as well as to outline pathways for mitigation and adaptation2. Their work has been described as “the world’s most influential climate report”3 and “the equivalent of the King James Bible on climate change”4.

As actors with the capacity to affect meaningful change within their countries and beyond, governments, parliamentarians and other policymakers are the primary targets of dissemination4. National governments are intertwined into the process itself to assist in their buy-in. Each government has to grant line-by-line approval to the summary for policymakers until it is agreed by consensus, and they agree to accept the reports as definitive5.

And yet, surprisingly little is known about the extent to which key messages from their summary reports are comprehended by parliamentarians. This is important given that the reports have been criticised for being overly complex for policymakers or the public to digest6, including by policymakers themselves4. Academics have also sought to raise attention that IPCC reports “treat politicians as a recipient of research findings, not an important object of detailed study”7. And yet the wider literature largely does not generally measure politicians’ climate change attitudes, including their knowledge of IPCC reports8. Understanding whether politicians have knowledge of key findings in IPCC reports is vital given that—despite the political consensus that the reports have—governments regularly follow differing if not contradictory policies to those that would be consistent with the reports’ findings9.

It is only recently that research on climate change and politicians has started to become a focus of peer-reviewed literature10. Getting access to politicians is difficult, especially sitting parliamentarians who have strong pressures on their time11, and thus the lack of research is understandable. However, the lack of awareness of politicians’ knowledge of the state of climate science is problematic. For although knowledge does not automatically result in policy action as people may not respond to scientific evidence in a linear way12,13,14,15, it is an important precursor to taking informed judgments. Empirical evidence demonstrates that knowledge can make a difference to politicians’ decisions on climate change16 as well as other policy areas17.

The limited research that exists on parliamentarians’ climate knowledge mostly examines knowledge of climate change’s human causes. In anglophone countries, this reveals considerable partisan divides18,19,20,21,22. Elsewhere, in a 2010 survey of Peruvian legislators, overall knowledge of ten statements based on the IPCC’s 2007 report (AR4) was poor23. While important contributions, from such literature we do not know whether parliamentarians internalise how urgent it is to implement deep and rapid decarbonisation. As one study examining knowledge of local politicians in Sweden (among other groups) has demonstrated, knowledge of climate change’s causes may be greater than that of its current state and future consequences24. Some richer information from MPs has been obtained through interviews25,26,27, but these are not designed to be representative.

Here, we address this gap by examining United Kingdom (UK) Members of Parliament’s (MPs’) knowledge of a key finding of the IPCC’s 6th assessment report: that global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by 2025 if global average temperature increases are to be kept to 1.5 °C. The question was also asked to a representative sample of the British public. Both surveys were fielded in late 2023. The case and issue selection have particular theoretical and normative value.

On the case, the UK has historically been an international leader on climate change mitigation. Its landmark 2008 Climate Change Act served as the blueprint for many other countries. The UK Parliament was also the first national parliament to declare an environmental and climate emergency in 2019 and it co-hosted the 2021 Glasgow Conference of the Parties28. While not negating the political divides that exist on climate policies that have become more prominent in recent years29,30, it is thus a most likely country for parliamentarians to be aware of the key findings from IPCC reports. If they are not, then that suggests that the dissemination of the messages into other parliaments may also be a problem. For comparative purposes, we draw on public surveys undertaken in Canada, Chile and Germany to examine the individual-level drivers of public responses given to the knowledge question.

On the choice of topic, the “global emissions must peak by 2025 to retain a realistic chance for 1.5 degrees” statement was a key communication of the IPCC report directed at publics and policymakers. As such, it received headline attention in Britain and internationally from across the news spectrum, including the Economist31, Daily Mail32, Guardian33, Euronews34 and the BBC35. Thus, MPs—and publics who pay attention to current affairs—should have been exposed to the finding even in the absence of reading the report. From the perspective of the report lead authors, it was something they emphasised as a key takeaway in media interviews. One lead author referred to the finding as “a bit of a bombshell”36 while another told the BBC News35 that:

“I think the report tells us that we’ve reached the now-or-never point of limiting warming to 1.5 °C. We have to peak our greenhouse gas emissions before 2025 and after that, reduce them very rapidly”.

On the United Nations news section, it was also something that one of the co-chairs of Working Group III was quoted on as a takeaway message37. Thus, it was both a visible message and one that those involved in the report considered important to highlight, with the BBC News38 indeed referring to it in a headline as a “key finding”.

Moreover, given the limited time period of action, the decisions of these MPs during their period of office (2019–2024) were important to aid in the collective worldwide effort to achieve the goal. The UK, like many other countries39, has committed in law to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Yet if MPs are not aware that urgent action needs to be taken much sooner, then that could be one potential explanatory factor for not meeting long-term climate mitigation commitments at the national level see ref. 40. Our results do demonstrate that knowledge of this particular finding of the IPCC’s to be extremely low, with just under 15% of both MPs and publics providing the correct answer of 2025, and over 30% of each stating 2040 or later.

Surveys of UK members of parliament

A representative sample of 100 members of the UK House of Commons were polled in September/October 2023 as well as 2002 members of the British public in November/December 2023 (see the “Methods” section for question wording and further details). They were each presented with a one-sentence summary of the IPCC, informed that a 2022 report had provided a timescale by which global greenhouse gases must peak to limit global heating to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, and asked to choose from a choice of options from “2025” to “2050” (in 5 yearly intervals) the timeframe they think this is.

Figure 1 compares top-level responses for both MPs and publics. The distribution is remarkably similar in both groups. Just under 15% gave the correct answer of 2025 with just over 30% opting for 2030. Around a third indicated that global emissions do not need to peak before 2040. The sizeable proportion that answer 2050 may suggest confusion in respondents’ minds with the country’s Net Zero by 2050 goal. Obviously, respondents might get the right answer simply by guessing, which in aggregate could exaggerate the true number of MPs choosing the correct answer. However, even if we take the 15% of MPs giving the correct answer as an optimistic estimate, this points to a widespread lack of knowledge among both parliamentarians and the British public on the urgency within which action is required, with the vast majority thinking that emissions can peak by the end of the subsequent parliamentary period or later.

Given previous findings that Labour MPs’ and voters’ belief in the anthropogenic causes of climate change are greater than those of Conservative MPs18 and voters41, might there be a similar knowledge gap on the window of action for 1.5 °C? To examine this, in Fig. 2, we breakdown the responses by Conservative and Labour party affiliation for MPs and reported vote at the 2019 General Election for the British public.

The results show differences between MPs and voters of the same party. 27% of Labour MPs got the answer correct in comparison to 20% of Labour voters, while Labour voters are similar to Labour MPs in thinking the correct answer is 2030 or 2050. There is no difference between Conservative MPs and Conservative voters in those who got the answer correct at just 8.5%. However, 21% of Conservative MPs and 26% of Conservative voters consider that it is the further timeframe of 2050—these are approximately 60 percent higher than the respective answers for Labour MPs and voters. Thus, party affiliation/support is clearly associated with beliefs on the window of opportunity available.

Surveys of publics in Britain, Canada, Chile and Germany

To assess whether this lack of knowledge is particular to Britain or more widespread, we also asked the question to publics in 3 other countries: Canada, Chile and Germany (See Fig. 3). The response distribution follows a broadly similar pattern in all countries as that observed in Britain, with those selecting the correct answer of 2025 falling to as low as 10% in Germany. Chileans have the highest percentage (37%) of responses selecting 2030, while Germans stand out for being evenly split between 2030 and 2035 as the modal answers. However, in all countries the correct answer “2025” is either the second or third least chosen response.

How do these patterns breakdown for different groups within each country? Given the large numbers of respondents, we can run ordinary least squares multivariate regression models to examine this. We code the dependent variable so that 1 (2050) represents the answer furthest from what the report found, and 6 (2025) represents the correct answer, i.e., higher values represent answers closer to the correct one. In this way, we can account for the degree of accuracy of respondents’ answers.

For explanatory variables, we include factors known to correlate with climate change beliefs and attitudes, beginning with sociodemographic predictors, that is age, gender, being university educated, living in an urban or rural area, and a measure of self-assessed social status41,42,43. To this, we add belief in the anthropogenic causes of climate change and worry about it, with greater levels of these having been found to relate to perceptions of the scientific consensus on climate change44,45. Moreover, general values, worldviews and political orientation may have substantial predictive power given previous research findings46. Therefore, we insert into our models left-right self-placement, a conspiracy belief mentality index, and a trust in scientists index. Given that we are examining knowledge of a report that was heavily publicised in the media, we additionally include self-reported political attention. All variables have been recoded to run from 0 to 1 (see the “Methods” section for further details).

The findings of the models are presented in Fig. 4. The one characteristic that is statistically significant in all countries is age, with younger individuals more likely to be closer to the correct answer. A further two variables are significantly correlated with being closer to the correct response in all countries except Chile: being more worried about climate change and having a lower conspiracy belief mentality. Unique to Chile in attaining statistical significance is residing in a more urban area. In Chile as well as Britain, those who trust scientists more are more likely to be closer to the correct answer. Controlling for all these factors, left-right self-placement only appears as statistically significant in Britain, where the more right-wing are more likely to be incorrect. Adding in vote at the previous election to the British model as discussed earlier in the paper (model not displayed), we see that this is driven by Conservative voters being further away and Green voters being closer on average to the correct answer than Labour voters.

In this paper, we investigated—firstly—whether MPs in the House of Commons and the British public were aware of a key and widely publicised finding from the IPCC’s 6th progress report: that global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by 2025 to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 °C. Our results demonstrated knowledge of this particular finding to be extremely low, with just under 15% of both MPs and publics providing the correct answer of 2025, and over 30% of each stating 2040 or later. Despite minimal aggregate differences between the MP and publics survey, a key divide was based on political party within MPs and publics, whereby Conservative MPs/voters were less likely to provide the correct answer than Labour MPs/voters. Secondly, we showed that these low levels of knowledge are not confined to publics in Britain but are also recorded by publics in the diverse countries of Canada, Chile and Germany. Greater accuracy among publics was generally predicted by being younger, being worried about climate change, and having lower levels of conspiracy belief mentality.

These results raise important implications for communicating findings from IPCC progress reports. Only a small percentage of MPs in the 2019–2024 House of Commons were aware of the report’s important finding that global emissions needed to peak during their period in office for the 1.5 °C target to be achievable. And yet, to act on information, individuals need to be aware of it. That the message is not getting through may be one barrier for the country being off track to meet their 2030 emissions reduction targets, which would require the imposition of more stringent climate mitigation measures as reported in the UK Climate Change Committee’s47 2024 report. The partisan divides in Britain—whereby MPs of the then ruling Conservative party were less likely to respond correctly than those of the then Labour opposition, and that these divides were mirrored among their voters—also suggest that whether information is perceived or not and, if so, how it is perceived, may differ according to political mindsets.

The UK is of course not the only country to be off track in meeting its 2030 emissions reduction targets. Taking into account the institutional constraints within countries, a 2024 study suggests that even under the most ambitious scenarios, there is only a 5–45% likelihood of staying below 1.6 °C at peak warming and that without a near-term increase in climate policy ambition that “an even higher overshoot will soon become inevitable”48. The other three countries in our publics surveys are all set to miss their 2030 emissions reduction targets as found in independent reports for Canada49, Chile50, and Germany51. Germany indeed is estimated to have the largest percentage gap within the European Union between its target and what it is set to achieve51. Our paper shows that knowledge of the degree of urgency required is low both within the political elite in the UK and in the public across four diverse countries. Politicians pay attention to the views of publics or constituents, whereby concern from below can motivate politicians into decarbonising action, and a lack of concern can act as a barrier10,52. Thus, the lack of awareness among members of the public of this key finding from the IPCC report—despite it being widely reported on—is of concern.

This present study has some limitations. While we focus on knowledge of an important policy-relevant finding, we cannot infer whether this low knowledge generalises to knowledge of other findings from the IPCC report. Furthermore, politicians and publics may be in possession of other knowledge and experiences that would propel them to undertake urgent action, and individuals may be aware of the IPCC’s findings without believing them or without these facts affecting their viewpoints. For while “scientific knowledge of climate change is clearly imperative for informed policy-making”53, the mechanism through which knowledge transfers to other facets of climate change beliefs, attitudes and policy support is not always straightforward15.

As we can identify the knowledge deficit among MPs but not ascertain the reason(s) for this in our study, we call for future research that can investigate such mechanisms through for instance in-depth qualitative interviews with national MPs across the globe on their consumption of IPCC findings and the perceived influence that these do (or do not) have on them. Being able to track MPs’ knowledge of a wider variety of findings from IPCC reports would also provide a more nuanced and complete understanding of what facts are landing with the IPCC’s core target audience and what is not.

To conclude, in a world of increasing information saturation and disinformation campaigns, getting factual information to permeate through political establishments and the public sphere is by no means an easy task. This is especially the case on a complex challenge like climate change for which certain powerful economic and political interests continue to widely spread misinformation on the facts of the issue54. But it is imperative in advance of the 7th progress report that the IPCC and the wider research community can further understand how to effectively get the key scientific messages across to policymakers and the broader public. As time for meaningful action is running out, achieving such a task is of an urgent nature.

Data collection

MP survey

MPs are a notoriously difficult group to contact given severe limits on their time11. One approach when carrying out MP surveys is for researchers to initiate contact with them and issue subsequent reminders to complete the survey; however, this typically leads to very low response rates or sample sizes by which it is not possible to make inferential claims on the wider population55.

To overcome this, our question was placed on an online Omnibus survey of MPs carried out by Savanta, which has a record of obtaining high-quality data with high response rates from MPs56,57,58. Savanta has been running its parliamentary panel for over 20 years. It runs its survey reaching 100 MPs multiple times a year while also engaging with parliamentarians outside fieldwork times to ensure regular participation. During fieldwork, Savanta monitors quotas and conducts quality control to ensure genuine completion from MPs. However, it is important to note that MPs on the “Government payroll”, i.e., Ministers, are not invited because by law these are not allowed to give any opinion that is not the Government policy. Ethics approval for this study—including the procedure for receiving informed consent from participants—was approved on 18th November 2022 by the Faculty of Science Research Ethics Subcommittee at the University of East Anglia (Ethics number: ETH2223-0766).

The field dates were from 6 September to 16 October 2023, with a total sample of 100 MPs. Weights correcting for party affiliation (Conservative, Labour, SNP and Other), region (North, Mid, South), gender (female/male) and age were provided by Savanta and applied in the analysis so that the sample represents the distribution of these characteristics in the House of Commons. As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2 below, the unweighted data closely matched key respondent characteristics in the House of Commons at the time of the survey.

Furthermore, as can be seen in Table 3, the impact of the survey weights on responses given to the knowledge question is minimal.

Publics survey

The publics surveys were fielded by Survation, which has a record of accuracy in polling, such as being the only member of the British Polling Council to correctly predict the hung parliament of the 2017 General Election59,60. Details of the fieldwork dates, sample size and quotas are included in Table 4. Weights were applied in the analysis so that the sample represents the distribution of key demographic characteristics at the national level; in addition to weighting based on the sampling quotas used, weights in Britain also accounted for votes at the 2019 General Election and the 2016 Brexit referendum; in Canada for votes at the 2021 Federal Election; in Chile for votes at the 2021 Presidential Election; and in Germany for votes at the 2021 Federal Election. Ethics approval for this study—including the procedure for receiving informed consent from participants—was approved on 18 November 2022 by the Faculty of Science Research Ethics Subcommittee at the University of East Anglia (Ethics number: ETH2223-0575), and amendments approved by the same subcommittee on 2 October 2023 (Ethics number: ETH2324-0224).

Survey questions

The wording of the fielded knowledge question is as follows:

“In 2022, the UN IPCC—an international working group of scientists who regularly summarize scientific assessment on climate change—released a series of progress reports.

One of these reports provided a timescale by which global greenhouse gas emissions must peak [i.e., stop increasing] to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

When do you think this is? Even if you are unsure of the answer or are unfamiliar with the reports, please provide your best guess”.

Response options were: 2025; 2030; 2035; 2040; 2045; 2050

Other variables

Note: For all questions below, where respondents responded “don’t know”, these have been treated as missing variables in analyses.

Age: What is your age; Sex: What is your sex; Education: What is the highest educational level that you have?

Urbanity: Would you describe the place where you live as (1) A farm or town in the country, (2) A country village, (3) A small city or town, (4) The suburbs or outskirts of a big city, (5) A big city.

Subjective social status: In our society, there are groups which tend to be towards the top and groups which tend to be toward the bottom. Below is a scale that runs top to bottom. Where would you put yourself on this scale? (1. Bottom–10. Top).

Past vote at 2019 UK general election: Thinking back to the General Election in December 2019, can you recall which party you voted for in that election?

Left-right: In politics, people sometimes talk of “left” and “right”. Where would you place yourself on this scale, where 0 means the left and 10 means the right?

For anthropogenic climate change belief and climate worry, we use the questions as fielded in the European Social Survey42. For the conspiracy mentality index, we used the 5-item index of Bruder et al.61. The trust in scientists index is composed of responses to the following two statements, each asked on a 1–5 agree/disagree scale: “I trust scientists to create knowledge that is unbiased and accurate” and “I trust scientists to inform the public on important issues”62.

Empirical strategy

For Figs. 1–3, we carried out descriptive crosstabulations and created the bar charts from these. For Fig. 4, we carried out ordinary least squares regression models within each of our four countries, utilising provided survey weights to match demographic targets at the national level. The results are robust to also carrying out ordinal logistic regression models.

For publics, we can exclude respondents who answered the knowledge question in 5 s or less to account for inattentiveness, as well as those who took 1 min or more to respond for potentially looking the answer up. Leaving a sample of 1732 individuals in Britain, this does not significantly change response distributions.

While this could be good news for the growing adoption of EVs in the U.S., the big question is how much of the growth was tied to the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit.

F stock is trading at elevated levels. Follow the breaking news here.

Ford's Record Quarter

Ford reported third-quarter U.S. overall automotive sales up 8.2%, marking its seventh consecutive month of sales growth.

Electric vehicle sales hit 85,789 in the quarter, up 19.8% year-over-year.

The Mustang Mach-E had its best-ever quarter with sales up 50.7% year-over-year. The F-150 Lightning had sales of 10,005 in the quarter, up 16.5% quarter-over-quarter. The electric pickup truck remained America's best-selling EV truck in the quarter.

Year-to-date, Ford's EV sales are 242,298, up 16.5% year-over-year.

GM's Record Quarter

General Motors reported a record 66,501 electric vehicles sold in the third quarter.

The company acknowledged that the federal tax credit expiration led to strong demand from consumers.

GM also said the Equinox EV is the bestselling non-Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric vehicle in the U.S.

GM's Cadillac brand was also acknowledged for having three of the top 10 bestselling luxury EVs in the U.S. through September.

According to InsideEVs, General Motors has already passed its 2024 EV sales total with one quarter left to go. General Motors has sold 144,668 EVs year-to-date in 2025, up from the 114,432 EVs sold in 2024. EV sales are up 103% year-over-year through the first three quarters.

EV Growth or One Unique Quarter?

Along with GM and Ford, Tesla also turned in a record quarter, reporting 497,009 vehicles delivered in the third quarter.

The record quarters for electric vehicles come during the last quarter of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which expired after Sept. 30.

Some automakers, including Ford, General Motors and Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) are looking at ways to extend the $7,500 tax credit for consumers to keep demand high.

The fourth quarter could see a significant pullback from third-quarter numbers, but it will be interesting to see how much of a lift it gets from having some automakers working to offer incentives to customers.

For the U.S. EV market, the big test will likely be the first-quarter delivery numbers, which will include no impact from the $7,500 federal tax credit. The sector is likely to see a significant drop off in demand from the third quarter.

To keep the U.S. EV market growing, automakers likely need to work on ways to lower the price point without the credits closer to $30,000, or the country could look to Chinese EV companies that have lower price points in other markets and are taking share from Tesla and other U.S. companies.

,American Energy,2025-10-02 18:08:50+00:00,Wyoming Public Media,"Naughton power plant will stop burning coal, despite Trump announcement - Wyoming Public Media","Caitlin Tan, www.wyomingpublicmedia.org, caitlin-tan",,,,,https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/natural-resources-energy/2025-10-02/naughton-power-plant-will-stop-burning-coal-despite-trump-announcement,"He spoke specifically about the federal money that will go toward coal power plants slated to close or switch fully to natural gas.
Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of the multi-state utility PacifiCorp, owns several coal power plants in Wyoming.
Last year, Rocky Mountain Power switched two of the units at its Jim Bridger coal power plant, near Rock Springs, to natural gas.
It plans to do the same for three of the four units at its Dave Johnston coal plant in Converse County by the end of the decade.
However, in the company’s latest resource management plan, released this past spring, it removed a retirement date for its Wyodak coal plant in Campbell County.","The Trump administration says it’s the era of “mine, baby, mine.” The federal government is tossing money at power plants to keep them burning coal, but a main electricity provider in Wyoming says it’s sticking with plans to fully convert a coal plant to natural gas by the end of the year.

The Trump administration announced this week $625 million to “reinvigorate” the coal industry, which has declined since its peak in 2007.

“These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in the press release.

Wyoming politicians are cheering this on, saying it’s great news for the top producing coal state in the nation.

“This whole thing unshackles the energy industry from anti-coal production,” said Wyoming’s Gov. Mark Gordon in a Tuesday press call.

He spoke specifically about the federal money that will go toward coal power plants slated to close or switch fully to natural gas. It’s unclear how much will go to Wyoming, but Gordon said he hopes companies will upgrade their aging power plants, so they can burn both coal and natural gas depending on markets.

“That probably would be something that they'll start working on here pretty, pretty quickly,” Gordon said.

Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of the multi-state utility PacifiCorp, owns several coal power plants in Wyoming. Some of the units have switched to natural gas and others have plans to.

Spokesperson David Eskelsen said a retrofit to simultaneously burn coal and gas is, “Theoretically, it's certainly possible, but whether it would be cost effective is another question altogether.”

Despite the federal announcement, Eskelsen said the company still plans to fully switch its Naughton coal power plant, near Kemmerer, to natural gas at the end of the year.

“Our planning horizons tend to operate on much longer terms than changes in federal policy,” Eskelsen said. “There's no way that we can really speculate on what future changes might do.”

Eskelsen said the company has taken an all of the above energy approach, meaning it sees coal, natural gas, renewables and nuclear as part of the mix. He added that while coal is more dependable than renewables, it’s more expensive.

“The cost of our coal units has had a huge impact on the price that customers pay,” Eskelsen said.

Wyomingites have seen numerous rate hikes in recent years, causing their electricity bills to go up.

“So the job as a utility is to take the advantages of all resource types and use them together to create a useful product for customers,” he said.

Last year, Rocky Mountain Power switched two of the units at its Jim Bridger coal power plant, near Rock Springs, to natural gas. It plans to do the same for three of the four units at its Dave Johnston coal plant in Converse County by the end of the decade. The other unit will fully retire in 2027.

However, in the company’s latest resource management plan, released this past spring, it removed a retirement date for its Wyodak coal plant in Campbell County. Also, the two remaining coal-fired units at Jim Bridger will be retrofitted with carbon capture technology. The idea is to use carbon capture to release less emissions, although it’s largely unproven on a commercial scale. The company is moving forward with retrofit plans to comply with a Wyoming mandate, although that may soon be rolled back.

The Department of Interior also announced this week it’ll open up 13.1 million more federal acres to coal mining. This is also part of Pres. Trump’s executive orders for “Unleashing American Energy” and “reinvigorating” coal.

Part of the acreage will include the West Antelope III project, which is in northeast Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, the top producing coal region in the nation. The lease sale for this land is scheduled to happen in person Oct. 8 in Cheyenne. It’s the first coal lease sale in Wyoming since 2012.

During the press call, Gordon was also excited about the additional mining. But he weighed in on what this means for CO2 emissions.

“I think probably the answer is fairly clear. There'll be more CO2 production,” Gordon said.

But he added that more investment in coal will help advance technology to make it a more eco-friendly product.

Burning coal is the largest contributor to climate change according to multiple studies, but it’s the second largest energy source worldwide. Scientists generally agree those emissions must be reduced to limit the worst impacts. However, the Trump administration is trying to roll back findings that show those emissions are harmful.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11db0bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Feb%2Fb3%2Fece7161e41f6b43d649669d2fc21%2Fnaughton-summer.JPG,N,,2025-10-02 15:02:39.933533

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom's office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

""This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,'' said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

“There is nationwide interest in the potential of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies.
UMass Lowell, MIT, and other institutions offer world-class academic, research, and training programs for those interested in advancing and working with nuclear technologies.
Today, there are two operating nuclear power plants in New England, with nuclear energy meeting approximately 20 to 25% of the region’s power needs each year.
I applaud the Healey-Driscoll administration for recognizing the important role nuclear energy has played in building a strong economy, and the potential advanced nuclear and fusion energy can and will play in the Commonwealth’s future.","Lowell — The Healey-Driscoll Administration is teaming up with University of Massachusetts Lowell to develop “Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy Roadmaps” to accelerate the state’s leadership in advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. The roadmaps will look at the distinct attributes and regulatory paradigms of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies and lay the foundation for further research, manufacturing and, ultimately, deployment of these technologies, to help affordably, reliably and sustainably meet increasing electricity demand in New England.

“Massachusetts has the ingredients to be a world-class leader in advanced nuclear and fusion energy – technologies that provide affordable power, good jobs and significant economic development,” said Governor Maura Healey. “There is nationwide interest in the potential of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. Our partnership with UMass Lowell will help us leverage our strengths to lower costs and grow these industries in Massachusetts.”

“Massachusetts has built many multi-billion-dollar industries on a strong foundation of good research and ingenuity, and we can do that again with advanced nuclear and fusion energy,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “With a clear, actionable roadmap, we can move quickly to attract investment to our state and grow our economy.”

“Nuclear power looks a lot different in 2025 – it uses a smaller footprint, produces less waste, and can be factory-assembled,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “Massachusetts wants to seize this opportunity for more additional reliable power. This industry is taking off, and Massachusetts can act quickly to position ourselves to attract new business opportunities and clean energy resources to the state.”

Massachusetts has a strong existing competitive advantage in advanced nuclear and fusion energy as the industries evolve nationwide. UMass Lowell and MIT both have nuclear research reactors, representing two of the 25 research reactors that exist nationally. The nuclear research conducted within Massachusetts forms the foundation for numerous world-leading industries, including energy, defense, heath care, and biomedical applications, notably cancer research. UMass Lowell, MIT, and other institutions offer world-class academic, research, and training programs for those interested in advancing and working with nuclear technologies. This includes a program at UMass Lowell for students to secure a reactor operator license.

“The University of Massachusetts is pleased to support the Healey-Driscoll Administration by leading the development of the Commonwealth’s nuclear and fusion energy roadmaps,” UMass President Marty Meehan said. “The UMass system is committed to advancing energy and climate tech innovations while also providing highly skilled graduates to drive economic development across the state. With its long-standing and successful nuclear science and engineering program, UMass Lowell is the perfect partner to lead this initiative and explore viable options and opportunities for partnership with our community, state, federal, and industry partners.”

“UMass Lowell is delighted to lead this key effort in partnership with the Healey Driscoll Administration,” said UMass Lowell Chancellor Julie Chen. “Energy expertise is a core strength at UMass Lowell and a big reason why we are the only AASHE STARS platinum rated campus in Massachusetts. Our team looks forward to a collaborative and engaging process that will outline viable options to enhance energy affordability, decarbonization, and economic development for the Commonwealth.”

“We selected Massachusetts as our global headquarters because of the world-class ecosystem that has enabled us to tap into the skilled workforce and talent to both manufacture and build the world’s first commercially relevant fusion machine that will demonstrate fusion can work as a commercial energy source,” said Bob Mumgaard, Commonwealth Fusion Systems CEO and co-founder. “We are excited about the Healey Driscoll Administration’s strategic roadmaps to position the Commonwealth to deploy this disruptive new clean energy technology.”

Massachusetts is home to the MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which is a global leader in fusion research. Additionally, it is home to Commonwealth Fusion Systems, headquartered in Devens, which is developing commercial-scale fusion technology. Incubated in Cambridge and spun out of MIT, CFS is now a multi-billion-dollar company employing nearly 1,000 people in Massachusetts, including engineers, electricians, technicians, welders, pipefitters, and construction workers.

Today, there are two operating nuclear power plants in New England, with nuclear energy meeting approximately 20 to 25% of the region’s power needs each year. With electricity demand growing, there is significant interest in exploring cutting-edge small modular reactors and fusion power plants. The New England states are working together, with support from the National Governors Association, to explore potential investment models for the deployment of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies.

Sukesh Aghara, Ph.D. will lead the development of the roadmap. He is a Professor of Nuclear Engineering, Ex-Chair and Executive Member of Nuclear Engineering Department Heads Organization, and current Associate Dean for Research of the Francis College of Engineering. The roadmaps will serve as a comprehensive framework to guide Massachusetts’ approach to exploring advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies for power generation and non-power generation applications. Over the four-month effort, UMass Lowell will engage stakeholders from across the UMass system, industry, government, and communities to assess existing capabilities, identify key gaps, and define opportunities for Massachusetts to lead in shaping the state’s and region’s advanced nuclear and fusion energy ecosystems. The roadmaps will outline steps to leverage Massachusetts' existing innovation ecosystem, scale workforce development programs to support long-term industry growth, develop strategies for inclusive community engagement, and coordinate planning efforts with other New England states. The roadmaps will not consider specific sites or restarting decommissioned facilities. It will serve as a foundational document to inform future legislative, regulatory, and investment decisions. The roadmaps are expected to be released by the end of the year.

Governor Healey’s Energy Affordability, Independence and Innovation Act would would remove a barrier to deploying advanced nuclear technologies by lifting an outdated requirement for a statewide ballot measure for every new nuclear power plant. While fusion power plants are already excluded from this requirement, this change would keep Massachusetts competitive as other nuclear technology advances such as small modular reactors. Between 2020 and today, eight of the fourteen states with some form of nuclear moratorium have lifted limitations, while other states have advanced various kinds of pro-nuclear incentives.

Statements of Support:

Chrissy Lynch, President of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO:

""We need more energy in Massachusetts, plain and simple. We can generate massive amounts of energy right here in Massachusetts through clean energy sources like advanced nuclear and fusion, and create thousands of union jobs for Massachusetts residents while we do it. I applaud Governor Healey for figuring out how we in Massachusetts can generate our own energy and support thousands of local careers at the same time.""

Harry Brett, International Representative for the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada:

“There is a bright future for advanced nuclear and fusion energy in Massachusetts. United Association members are building, operating, and maintaining nuclear systems across the country, and we stand ready to bring more advanced energy solutions to our Commonwealth with the highest quality and safety in the industry.”

Kevin Knobloch, President of Knobloch Energy LLC; former Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Energy; former President of the Union of Concerned Scientists; and former CEO and President, Greentown Labs:

""We in Massachusetts are proud of our tradition of braving new frontiers in response to great challenges and needs. The UMass Lowell roadmap exercise is a vital investigation that will build on Massachusetts' long and impactful history in developing nuclear energy as a clean and firm energy source. The brisk timeline to identify options to strengthen our state's leadership in this sector shows a commitment by the Healey-Driscoll Administration to taking action when there’s not a minute to lose. Governor Healey’s initiative is key to meeting rising electricity demand with new power sources – such as small modular reactors – that are reliable, affordable, safe, carbon free and scalable.""

Dan Leary, President of UWUA Local 369:

“Massachusetts and the region need more energy supply. The men and women of UWUA stand ready to make sure that energy supply operates safely and reliably. I applaud the Healey-Driscoll administration for recognizing the important role nuclear energy has played in building a strong economy, and the potential advanced nuclear and fusion energy can and will play in the Commonwealth’s future. Advanced nuclear and fusion energy have the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs, meet our growing energy needs without impacting the climate or local air quality, and ensure we have a stable and reliable energy grid for decades to come.”

John G. Tzimorangas, President and CEO of Energy New England and President of Northeast Public Power Association (NEPPA):

""Public Power has long been an advocate of nuclear power as part of its resource portfolio. This has helped public power balance the cost and reliability aspects that have been a cornerstone of municipal utilities. The public power community is excited and encouraged about the prospect of advanced nuclear (including SMR's) and fusion, with our own Commonwealth Fusion leading the way. Our regional organization, Northeast Public Power Association, has a resolution to promote Advanced Nuclear and Fusion technology and we are excited to support the Commonwealth's initiatives.”

Michael Collins, MD, UMass Chan Medical School Chancellor:

“Advancing nuclear and fusion energy technology to better deliver power in Massachusetts will reduce air pollution, improve climate resilience and enhance public health. Developing and employing clean energy will lead to cleaner air and that means better public health for all, particularly for our most vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to air pollution and heat stress.”

Tom Barry, CEO of the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company:

“The Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company (MMWEC) is a steadfast supporter of nuclear energy, as a joint owner of Millstone Unit 3 and Seabrook Station, and has extolled the benefits of nuclear for decades. As the Commonwealth’s joint action agency for municipal utilities, MMWEC is uniquely positioned to work with the Administration to move forward with these technologies. We believe this next generation of advanced nuclear and fusion energy is essential for improving regional energy independence, and will be a critical piece of our decarbonized future.”

Mike Monohan, Vice President of IBEW Region 2:

“Every day, thousands of IBEW members go to work in nuclear plants around the country and go home safely every night to their families. They keep the lights on, provide affordable electricity for tens of millions of Americans and businesses, and support the economies of their local communities. Nuclear energy provides good jobs, clean power, and operates with the highest standards for safety. Period. Today, New Englanders rely on nuclear for more than 20% of their electricity, and Massachusetts consumes more of that energy than any other state in the region. Governor Healey and her team are spot on – we need to look at what Massachusetts can do to build and expand the nuclear and fusion energy ecosystems we have here in Massachusetts and figure out how our energy consumers can benefit from these clean energy resources, and how we can make sure our people and communities don’t lose out on opportunities for high paying, long-term jobs.”

Armond Cohen, Executive Director of Clean Air Task Force (CATF):

“Clean firm power like nuclear fission and fusion can help drive rapid, affordable, reliable decarbonization and complement the deployment of weather-dependent renewable energy. By developing a coordinated roadmap for these technologies, Massachusetts is moving decisively to expand clean firm power in a way that can drive economic growth and benefit communities, leveraging world-class research institutions, attracting investment, and creating high-quality jobs all while delivering low-carbon power to meet growing electricity demand. Strategic planning like this ensures that these technologies are deployed safely and equitably, strengthening Massachusetts’ competitive edge in the clean energy economy and advancing regional climate goals.”

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades.","The Department of Energy is cancelling more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.

The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a government shutdown and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought posted on the social media site X that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Energy Department said in a news release that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""

The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:

Clean Energy Demonstrations, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

Grid Deployment, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure

Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security

Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies

Fossil Energy, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.

Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.

""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, posted on X.

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.

Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought announced the funding freeze in a post on X.

Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, said on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.

The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to limit the construction of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they can be built quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

""Ripping funding away from only blue states will raise utility bills for EVERYONE,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, posted on X. ""It's not rocket science.""

Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, spoke at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi, a forum for Russia experts. He spoke in Russian and his words were translated by. Here are some main quotes. TOMAHAWK MISSILES - UKRAINE It is impossible to use Tomahawks in the absence of direct involvement by American military personnel. This would be a qualitatively and completely new level of escalation in both the relations between Russia, and the United States. On TRUMP's description of Russia as a paper tigger: ""A paper tiger. What happens next? ""Go and deal with the paper tiger."" ""Well, if we're fighting with the whole NATO bloc, we're moving, advancing and we feel confident and we're a paper Tiger, then what exactly is NATO?"" HYSTERIA AMONG EUROPE’S LEADERS ""The ruling class of Europe continues to stir up hysteria. The war with Russia is almost at our doorstep. This mantra is repeated over and over. ... Can't they believe that Russia will attack NATO, as they say? ... ""They're either dishonest or incredibly incompetent, if they believe that nonsense. It's impossible to accept this."" ON RUSSIA'S RESPONSE TO EUROPEAN MILITARY BUILDUP: ""We cannot ignore the situation."" For our own safety, we have no right to ignore what is happening. Our defence and safety, I repeat. We are therefore closely monitoring the militarization of Europe."" ""Are they just empty words or is it the time to countermeasure? Germany, for instance, claims that the German Army should be the strongest in Europe. Good. ""We listen to what the speaker is saying and understand it."" I don't think anyone doubts that these measures will force Russia into action, and Russia will have countermeasures in no time. I think that (to put it mildly) the response to such threats will be very convincing. On the Ukraine Conflict: ""We thank all countries who have been sincere in their efforts to find a solution to this problem over the past few years."" This includes our partners, the founding members in BRICS, Belarus, and, by the way North Korea. In the Arab World as a group, primarily the UAE along with many other countries. ""Unfortunately, the fighting has not stopped, but responsibility does not lie with the majority of countries, but rather with a small minority in Europe who are constantly escalating conflict."" RELATIVE TO RELATIONS WITH UNITED STATES We all know that our countries have many differences. We have different views on global issues. It is not unusual for major powers to clash.

Tesla records record deliveries; concerns grow over EV demand after tax credits

Tesla reported record quarterly deliveries Thursday. However, concerns that the U.S. Tax Credit for EVs will expire soon and turn a rush into a trickle weighed down its shares. Elon Musk's carmaker, which is led by Elon Musk, went all-in to boost sales prior to the removal of the $7.500 federal tax credit. They used a combination discounts, financing offers, social media ads, and emails from customers. ""I am skeptical that this will last and I believe we could have a couple of soft quarters,"" said Elliot Johnson. He is the chief investment officer for Evolve ETFs which manages Tesla investments. Johnson explained that the sales spike was due to a pull-forward of demand to lock in incentives rather than a growing consumer interest. He added it wouldn't be irrational to investors to ""sell news"" and purchase again next year. Tesla shares fell 3.4% during afternoon trading. Stocks have been rising recently, up 14% in the last year at Wednesday's closing. This is after Musk's pay package was proposed by the board. Tesla and its competitors received government credits to use them in attractive leases. Tesla is now offering leases after the credits expire. Lease prices are rising Tesla offers a credit for its vehicles. Tesla's prices, excluding credit, remain unchanged. The company announced on Thursday that it had delivered 497.099 vehicles in the three-month period ended September. This is up 7.4% compared to 462,890 vehicles a year ago, and far above the expectations of Wall Street, which was for 443,919 cars. Model 3 compact sedans, as well as its most popular Model Y crossovers, accounted for 481,166 of the deliveries. The automaker will report its quarterly results on Tuesday, October 22. According to Troy Teslike an independent Tesla researcher, the strong demand for the refreshed Model Y has helped boost sales in China. In September, it began delivering the six seat Model Y L to China. This family-oriented variant is designed to boost demand in the largest EV market in the world. Europe, on the other hand, was a weak point as competitors aggressively promoted plug in hybrids. Meanwhile, Chinese EV brands began gaining ground on a hyper-competitive marketplace. According to the Automobile Manufacturers' Association of the region, the company's European sales in August fell by 22.5% compared to a year ago, reducing its market share from 2.5% to just 1.5%. Visible Alpha projects that Tesla will deliver 1.61 million vehicles in 2025, which is roughly 10% less than 2024. Tesla must deliver 389.498 vehicles during the December quarter in order to meet this projection. Rivian, a smaller competitor, lowered its midpoint forecast for annual deliveries on Thursday, but exceeded estimates for quarter-end deliveries due to an increase in demand by buyers eager to take advantage tax credits. MUSK AND TESLA Musk's wealth is largely derived from his Tesla holdings. A recent rise in the stock price of the company helped him surpass the $500 billion mark Wednesday. This boosted his position as the richest person on the planet. The board of directors has proposed that shareholders vote on a new award for the CEO. This could give Musk 12% ownership in the company worth up to $1 trillion if certain performance and valuation goals are met. These include delivering 20,000,000 vehicles within a 10 year period. The billionaire has positioned Tesla as more of a technology company rather than an EV manufacturer by focusing on AI based self-driving system, robotaxis, and humanoid robotics. Cheaper Models Tesla has delayed the launch of the Model Y, a lower-cost variant, in the U.S. by several months. The plan is to eventually build the variants in China and Europe. Tesla announced in June that the company had built ""first builds"" but that they would begin selling the vehicles in the fourth quarter, and increase production slower than expected. Analysts say that Tesla's ability cushion a slowdown after the credit crunch will be heavily dependent on its push to lower-priced model. Matt Britzman is a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown and personally owns Tesla stock. Sources told us earlier this year that the stripped-down model is intended to be about 20% cheaper to manufacture than the refreshed Model Y. It could scale up to around 250,000 units a month in the U.S.",https://energynews.oedigital.com/img/energy-news-sqr.svg,N,,2025-10-02 20:01:21.753317

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases officially ended on Sept. 30 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Despite the rush of customers into showrooms to take advantage of the savings, the buying experience remained strong. According to CDK Global’s Ease of Purchase index, 89% customers said that it was easy to purchase a vehicle in September. This score remains unchanged from August and aligns with the September 2024 results.

Recently, finding the desired vehicle at a dealership has become increasingly complex for customers. In September, in-stock vehicle availability improved to 48%, a three-point increase from August, although still below the ideal benchmark of 50%. Approximately 12% of buyers had to visit four or more dealerships to find the vehicle they were looking for. Another 23% had to order their vehicle from the factory, and only 8% were able to find an alternative in stock.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

As part of that rule, the EPA is evaluating whether to reallocate 100% or 50% of refinery exemptions granted for 2023 and 2024, as well as those anticipated for 2025.

During his remarks at the hearing, IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw strongly urged the EPA to finalize its proposal to reallocate 100% of the 2023-2025 refinery exemptions. “The law requires EPA’s prime directive to be ensuring RFS blending levels are met,” said Shaw. “Only full reallocation will maintain the integrity to the RFS and deliver meaningful benefits to rural America.”

Shaw noted that while the delays and backlogs of processing the refinery exemption requests were inherited by the current EPA, it is their duty to fully implement the RFS.

“IRFA strongly believes EPA should finalize its proposal to reallocate 100% of the exemptions over 2026-2027. We are concerned by reports that a 50% reallocation scheme is gaining steam. If EPA ultimately determines that 100% reallocation over 2026-2027 is not possible, the agency should not undermine the RFS with 50% reallocation. Instead, as an alternative, the EPA should reallocate 100% of the 2023-2025 exemptions over four years. This approach would have the same market impact in the short term as 50% reallocation but would still provide lasting support for American farmers and the biofuels industry.”

Shaw also commended the EPA for proposing strong RFS blending levels, stating, “The originally proposed blending levels for 2026 and 2027 were robust and appreciated.

While the more than 4 million votes for “yes” outnumbered the more than 1.5 million “no” votes, the number of affirmative votes failed to surpass the 25 percent threshold of eligible voters also required for the referendum to pass. As a result, Taiwan remains on the nuclear-free path it has followed since the shutdown of the nuclear plant in question, Maanshan nuclear power plant, in southern Taiwan on 17 May, fulfilling a 2016 government pledge made as a result of Japan’s 2011 Fukushima disaster.

However, high-tech industries including semiconductor manufacturing, AI data centers and AI infrastructure operators, will continue fueling electricity demand. The question remains as to whether or not Taiwan can deliver reliable, clean power to support the growth of these industries amid Chinese geopolitical pressure—and without nuclear energy.

Taiwan’s Nuclear Energy Debate

Taiwan’s energy landscape remains complex. Nuclear power, developed since the 1970s, has seen older reactors retired since 2018. Taiwan imports 95 percent of its energy and has a growing reliance on natural gas. But it also aims to reduce carbon emissions, improve grid reliability, and expand its energy storage options.

“Without energy, there’s no industrial growth… and nuclear is an excellent option,” NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said during a pre-referendum visit to Taipei on 22 August. He met with key players in high-tech supply chains, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest chip foundry producing advanced chips for smartphones, high-performance computing, and AI applications.

It was not Huang’s first time advocating for nuclear energy. During Computex Taipei in May he said, “We need energy from any single source: wind, solar, nuclear. Taiwan should absolutely invest in nuclear, and it shouldn’t be a stigma to have energy.”

Nvidia has been expanding in Taiwan, partnering with Foxconn and the government to build a 10,000-Blackwell GPU AI training and supercomputing facility in the south, opening a larger Taipei office, and collaborating with Taiwanese companies such as TSMC to build an AI infrastructure ecosystem.

Taiwan president Lai Ching-te promised to honor the referendum result while focusing on diverse energy sources. He said Taiwan might consider advanced nuclear options if technology improves, waste decreases, and public support grows.

In late August, the government approved a draft piece of legislation, the AI Basic Act, designed to create a supportive environment for AI development and use. The draft emphasizes the government’s role in promoting AI research, applications, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the newly reshuffled Cabinet is under pressure by industry and the broader public to maintain energy security.

In mid-September, newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs Ming-hsin Kung emphasized that Taiwan is a global hub for chips and technology, shaping strategies for the next 10 to 20 years.

Taiwan’s Renewable Energy Goals

Kung stressed that businesses require both stable power supply and green energy to meet commitments to 100 percent renewable energy from global corporate initiative RE110. He said the new Cabinet will continue focusing on renewable energy while adjusting rollout speed. The goal is to lift renewables to 20 percent of Taiwan’s power supply by the end of 2026—a challenging target critical in keeping Taiwan competitive in global supply chains. He estimated renewable energy will account for around 15 percent of power generation by the end of 2025, up from 11.9 percent in 2024.

For solar, Kung pledged to strengthen existing projects, resolve land-use conflicts with fish farms in solar-fishery initiatives, and replace older solar panels with newer ones that produce twice as much energy. Offshore wind construction will be accelerated, and a trial program for floating wind turbines will resume. Taiwan will also actively develop other green energy sources, such as geothermal and hydrogen.

On nuclear, Kung reaffirmed Taiwan’s nuclear-free path but left open the possibility of adopting advanced technologies like small modular reactors. Guidelines for evaluating potential restarts of existing plants will be released by the end of October. The first step will see the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) conducting assessments of all three halted nuclear plants, with initial results due next year. Maanshan, which began commercial operations in 1984, is regarded as the most likely to pass the safety self-assessments, which will focus on the ability to maintain aging equipment and upgrade earthquake resilience.

In a report released on 26 September, Taiwan’s Energy Administration projects electricity demand to grow 1.7 percent annually from 2025 to 2034. The forecast factors in expansions to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, investments in AI development, and expected energy savings.

To meet rising power demand, the government currently plans to boost natural gas generation while phasing out large nuclear, coal, and oil plants. Net additions of 12.2 gigawatts in gas-fired capacity are expected by 2034.

Semiconductor Industry Concerns

But high-tech industries express concern. In early September, at SEMICON Taiwan, Charles Lee, the managing director of Topco Group, a major semiconductor supplier, told IEEE Spectrum that manufacturers worry about grid stability as AI and semiconductor growth accelerates. “Highly polluting coal-fired plants are no longer an option, so we will rely more on liquefied natural gas and less-stable renewables. If nuclear plants could be restarted, I would personally welcome it,” Lee says.

Meanwhile, a memory manufacturing director, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he isn’t authorized by his company to speak to the media, told IEEE Spectrum that Taiwan’s economy is still manufacturing-driven. “We’re concerned about the low efficiency of green energy. We’ve also noticed a trend abroad, with countries resuming nuclear plant construction,” he says.

In a televised debate ahead of the August referendum, Tzu-Hsien Tung, chairman of Pegatron Corporation, voiced support for restarting nuclear power plants. He warned that if Taiwan continues to rely on carbon-heavy electricity, local firms could face steep carbon taxes overseas, undermining their global competitiveness.

As Taiwanese society debated whether to restart nuclear power plants, some Taiwanese energy experts, including Tze-Luen Lin, deputy executive director of the Taiwanese government’s Office of Energy and Carbon Reduction and a political science professor at National Taiwan University, have called for fresh approaches to Taiwan’s energy resilience amid ongoing Chinese threats, echoing to notions brought by non-governmental organizations and thinkthanks, such as the U.S.-based Center for Climate and Security, that a clean energy transition can strengthen national security.

At the Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies conference in Japan on 21 September, Lin highlighted that renewable energy is central to both energy and national security. He emphasized, “Energy resilience can only be strengthened through decentralized, locally sourced renewables, combined with microgrids and energy storage,” and warned that large, centralized power plants are easier targets for attack.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61689921&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C12%2C0%2C588,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:29.581986

​

ANNAPOLIS, MD — Governor Wes Moore today announced a historic agreement with Constellation Energy to fund and implement operational improvements and environmental projects at the Conowingo Dam. The commitments—valued at more than $340 million and negotiated in partnership with Waterkeepers Chesapeake and Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association—will meet enforceable water quality standards by mitigating the impacts associated with the dam’s operation.

“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” said Gov. Moore. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers. By bringing everyone to the table, we have struck an agreement that is good for the environment, good for energy production, and good for Marylanders.”

The agreement clears the way for the re-licensing and continued operation of the dam’s hydroelectric facility on the Susquehanna River, which is the largest source of renewable energy in the state. The terms of the agreement, announced today at the dam, include operational improvements and upfront and ongoing annual payments:

Water quality and resiliency: $87.6 million for pollution reduction and resiliency initiatives, including shoreline restoration, forest buffers, fish passage projects and planting underwater grasses that produce oxygen, stabilize sediments and provide habitat for countless species.

Trash and debris removal: $77.8 million to strengthen efforts that already clear an average of about 600 tons of debris each year, with innovative approaches like barging for removal.

Aquatic life passage: More than $28 million for fish and eel passage improvements and protections at the dam, helping American shad, river herring, and freshwater mussels rebound while reconnecting habitats across the Susquehanna.

Freshwater mussel restoration: $23.3 million to build and operate a hatchery that will seed the river with mussels, which, like oysters, are natural filters that clean the water and reduce pollution flowing into the Bay.

Dredging: $18.7 million to support additional studies on dredging and related activities.

Invasive species management: $9.4 million to control destructive species like snakeheads and blue catfish, protecting the river’s ecosystem and supporting Maryland’s fishing economy.

Ongoing: Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association and Waterkeepers Chesapeake have an ongoing role in aspects of the implementation of the certification and settlement agreement.

“This historic agreement ensures that our children and grandchildren will inherit a Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River that are cleaner and healthier than they are today,” said Attorney General Anthony G. Brown. “I'm proud of our office’s tireless efforts in this case to improve water quality and protect the lives and livelihoods of Marylanders who depend on these essential waterways for recreation and work.”

The commitments are contained in a Revised Water Quality Certification issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment and a companion settlement agreement. The department issues certifications pursuant to authority from Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. For a dam, a certification works like a permit and has conditions and requirements for the operation of the dam.

An initial certification was issued in 2018, but legal challenges led to a 2019 waiver of that certification and settlement, requiring the dam owner to invest in improvements valued at $230 million. The terms were dependent on the facility’s receipt of a 50-year federal license, but an appeals court vacated that license in 2022.

To reach the agreement announced today, the extensive reconsideration process included a public comment period and more than a year of mediation involving the State, Constellation, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association and Waterkeepers Chesapeake, leading to the agreement announced today. A Revised Water Quality Certification will be filed with the federal government for the dam’s license to be renewed.

“With this agreement, we are protecting clean water and vibrant ecosystems for generations to come while supporting jobs, commerce, and energy security,” said Maryland Department of the Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain. “All parties—including environmental groups who challenged a previous framework—have signed on. From restored fisheries to enhanced recreation and tourism, the benefits of a healthier Susquehanna River flow through our communities, our industries, and the Chesapeake Bay.”

“The Susquehanna watershed is home to one of the largest concentrations of clean energy generation in America, and Constellation is proud to build on that nearly century-old legacy, investing heavily in clean generation, protecting water quality and powering Maryland’s economy,” said Constellation President and Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez. “But it’s not just the scale of the investments we are making that makes us proud, it’s how we are investing. Some utility monopolies are claiming they can lower your electricity costs by building new generation, but they want you to guarantee their profits. That’s just not fair, especially now, when many families are already struggling to pay higher electricity bills. In the last decade, Constellation has invested more than $1 billion in Maryland clean energy projects, from wind and hydro to state-of-the-art nuclear energy, and we will never ask Maryland families to bear business risks that we won’t.”

Cleaner waterways bolster tourism in Maryland, which generates about $3.2 billion a year in economic activity. Improved water quality and habitat also benefits Maryland’s seafood industry, which contributes nearly $600 million to the state’s economy each year.

“The relicensing of Conowingo Dam is critical to the health of the Susquehanna River and the overall restoration of the Chesapeake Bay,” said Waterkeepers Chesapeake Acting Executive Director Robin Broder. “Today’s agreement marks a new era for the dam and a new commitment for clean water. The funding for water quality projects, a pathway to dredging, and investments in living resources such as the freshwater mussel hatchery are significant steps forward. Though more than a decade in the making, this agreement is not the end of our efforts, but rather the beginning of an important new chapter. Waterkeepers Chesapeake and Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper look forward to providing oversight on the implementation of this important agreement.”

“Today’s announcement marks 16 years of tremendous effort and perseverance by our organization to assure Conowingo Dam is relicensed with proper conditions that protect the health of the Lower Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay,” said Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper and Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association Executive Director Ted Evgeniadis. “Without the unwavering commitment of the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper, dredging the reservoir to stop harmful pulses of sediment and pollution from reaching the bay would not have been considered. In partnership with Waterkeepers Chesapeake, our successful appeal of the license and the 2019 Settlement brought the parties back together to renegotiate far better terms that will improve water quality and protect our aquatic species for the next 50 years.”

Once the conditions of the Revised Water Quality Certification are incorporated in the dam’s operating license, Maryland will ensure that the obligations in the Certification are fully and effectively enforced.

“Restoring the Chesapeake Bay is both an environmental and economic imperative for Maryland – countless lives and livelihoods throughout the watershed depend on it,” said U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen. “This agreement marks a major step toward a healthier Bay and a stronger Maryland. With it we are poised to make important strides in improving water quality and bolstering our seafood and outdoor recreation – while securing a key source of clean energy for our state for years to come.”

“I am looking forward to this $340 million agreement which will invest in environmental projects over the next 50 years to support the health of the Susquehanna River and the beating heart of our state – the Chesapeake Bay,” said U.S. Senator Angela Alsobrooks. “This settlement will continue to provide reliable, clean energy for Maryland, clean up our environment by removing trash and debris, control invasive species, protect our ecosystem, and improve our state's water quality.”

“I am proud that all parties, under the leadership of Governor Wes Moore and his administration, reached an agreement on the Conowingo Dam that balances the needs of all Marylanders,” said U.S. Congressman Steny Hoyer. “The Conowingo Dam settlement represents an important investment in the health of our treasured Chesapeake Bay, something I have spent my career fighting for, as well as a clear path forward for Conowingo to continue providing clean, reliable power for Maryland and the broader region.”

“The Conowingo Dam, while an important renewable source of energy for the State of Maryland, has also played a role in sediment reaching the Chesapeake Bay,” said U.S. Congressman Kweisi Mfume. “I commend Governor Wes Moore and the Maryland Department of the Environment’s success in bringing all parties together for a new Conowingo Dam settlement agreement which will increase investment into environmental remediation and restoration.”

“The new Conowingo Dam settlement is an excellent example of solutions-oriented stakeholder engagement,” said U.S. Congresswoman Sarah Elfreth. “The impact of this historic investment in water quality and the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem will have generational impacts, including the development of a new freshwater mussel hatchery, water quality monitoring, and combating invasive species like the blue catfish. I look forward to the implementation of these exciting projects.”

“It is critical we protect and invest in the Chesapeake Bay — a cultural and economic lifeline for our state,” said U.S. Congressman Johnny Olszewski. “I applaud our state agencies and Constellation for their collaboration with local conservation organizations to reach a deal that will strengthen the health of the Bay for years to come. I thank all of the stakeholders who understood the urgent need to support this essential Chesapeake tributary and clean energy source.”

“With this historic agreement, we’re making a commitment to better protect our state’s water quality and vital ecosystems all while creating a brighter future for clean energy,” said U.S. Congresswoman April McClain Delaney. “The Conowingo Dam’s re-licensing and operational improvements mean our environment and waterways are better off — along with the Maryland communities that depend on them for everything from commercial prosperity to hydroelectric power. This is a win for innovation, for our Maryland businesses, and for protecting our water resources.”

“The Conowingo Dam has been providing the lowest cost renewable energy electricity to Marylanders for decades, and, with this agreement, will be allowed to continue to do so,” said U.S. Congressman Andy Harris.

“This deal ensures we balance the importance of generating renewable energy while protecting water quality standards and the broader ecosystem,” said Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary and Chesapeake Bay Program Principals’ Staff Committee Chair Josh Kurtz. “The settlement will allow us to apply the innovative strategies we developed restoring oysters in Chesapeake Bay tributaries to bring back water-filtering mussels in the Susquehanna River basin and other freshwater rivers in Maryland. Thank you to everyone who helped us reach this agreement.”

Governor Moore included more than $400 million in his FY26 budget for Chesapeake Bay and clean water projects that create local jobs, improve public spaces, and enhance property values. Building on this commitment, Maryland has taken action to decrease pollution and crafted a new bay strategy focused on industry best practices.

In May, Governor Moore signed the Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act, which supports sustainable farming, expands oyster restoration, and modernizes water quality programs. Key provisions include creating a certification program for farmers who use practices that reduce runoff, establishing a unified water quality monitoring program, and strengthening oyster aquaculture leasing. To further advance these efforts, the Moore Administration has expanded funding for enhanced nutrient removal upgrades, provided resources to farmers and local governments, and financed innovative projects like the $200 million Piscataway Bioenergy facility serving Prince George’s and Montgomery counties.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a lifelong family farmer and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, led over 45 Senate and House colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize a rule on imported Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and hold firm on the proposed biomass-based diesel volumes.

In their bipartisan, bicameral letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the members state such measures would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) continues to strengthen American energy security and support both American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members said.

In June, the EPA proposed record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in its Set 2 proposal and included a 50% reduction in RINs for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction).

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal, saying it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation and manufacturing – particularly in rural communities.

Additional cosigners include Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Michael Rounds (R-S.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).

In the House, the letter was signed by Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Derek Schmidt (R-Kan.), Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Tracey Mann (R-Kan.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Max Miller (R-Ohio), James Baird (R-Ind.), Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Mike Bost (R-Ill.), David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), John Rose (R-Tenn.), Erin Houchin (R-Ind.), Mark Messmer (R-Ind.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), Mark Alford (R-Mo.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Mich.), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Rudy Yakym (R-Ind.), Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.), Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).

Organizations endorsing the letter include the American Soybean Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Oilseed Processors Association and the National Sorghum Producers.

Grassley helped establish the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and has worked to ensure the executive branch implements the law as intended. In April, Grassley and Klobuchar urged the EPA to restore integrity, stability and growth to the RFS and the U.S. biofuel sector by raising RVO levels for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. The Biden-era EPA set RVOs at levels that fail to align with market conditions and production outlook, which has contributed to biodiesel plant closures in the Midwest.

The Honorable Lee M. Zeldin

Administrator

Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We thank the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for proposing record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in the Set 2 proposal and for including a 50 percent reduction in Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction). The combination of the strong BBD volumes coupled with prioritizing U.S. feedstocks represents a commonsense approach that puts American farmers first, strengthens domestic biofuel markets, and delivers tangible economic benefits to rural communities.

Soybean oil may only represent 20 percent of the bean, but it accounts for more than half of its value in the U.S. market, and about half of that oil is used to make advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. That means roughly a quarter of every bushel's value processed here in the U.S. is directly tied to biofuel demand. At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal: it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities where oilseed processing facilities are located. This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called “used cooking oil” from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.

For these reasons, we urge EPA to finalize the Import RIN reduction as proposed and to hold firm on the biomass-based diesel volumes in the rule. Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers.","Subscribe to The Y’all — a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies defining Texas, produced by Texas Tribune journalists living in communities across the state.

LUBBOCK — Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

[Running Out: Texas’ water crisis — and the path forward]

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

[Data centers are thirsty for Texas’ water, but state planners don’t know how much they will need]

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers”

Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there's better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water”

Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

Town halls are expected to begin in November.

The EPA system by which companies calculate how many climate-altering emissions their facilities produce is called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).
The burning of fossil fuels is responsible for 75 percent of global carbon emissions.

Using Carbon Majors, a database of carbon emissions dating back to the start of the Industrial Revolution, UCS has shown that just 122 fossil fuel and cement companies are responsible for 94% of industrial carbon dioxide emissions since 1959.","The ongoing campaign by the White House to block accountability for the fossil fuel industry has hit a new low with the proposed elimination of mandatory carbon emission accounting. A look at the global business and policy landscape, however, indicates that this effort may hurt not just public health and safety, but the very companies the proposal is supposed to help.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed a rule on September 12 that would eliminate requirements for measuring and reporting carbon emissions for the vast majority of US industries, including fossil fuel producers and refiners. This comes on the heels of multiple other attempts by Administrator Zeldin to relieve fossil fuel interests from climate accountability, most prominently his proposal to rescind the EPA’s 2009 finding that global-warming emissions are harmful—and thus require regulation—despite decisive scientific research showing that such emissions pose a serious threat to human health.

The EPA system by which companies calculate how many climate-altering emissions their facilities produce is called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). GHGRP had bipartisan support upon its creation by Congress in 2008, and many have come to value the data it produces. Scientists use GHGRP data to track emissions trends and determine hot spots, information crucial for informing policymakers as well as well as communities exposed to these high levels of pollution. Systematically measuring emissions allows companies to compare their numbers with those of competitors and communicate with investors and the public about their climate impacts.

When the EPA first announced its intention to reconsider GHGRP months ago, indications were that certain oil and gas facilities would still have to report emissions. The burning of fossil fuels is responsible for 75 percent of global carbon emissions. The proposal that was ultimately released in September, however, would permanently remove reporting obligations for fossil gas distribution entities and suspend reporting for other oil and gas facilities until 2034.

No reporting, no deal

The White House clearly considers the GHGRP rollback part of its plan to pump up US oil and gas production. The US exports far more gas than coal and hopes to surge exports to regions like the European Union (EU), as evidenced by the administration’s recent European medicine show, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright told leaders to roll back environmental regulations and buy more US fossil fuels.

However, killing the program may actually complicate such efforts. GHGRP data can be used to qualify companies to sell their oil and gas to countries and regions with carbon emission disclosure standards, like the EU. Though the EU is slated to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. gas after some arm-twisting by the Trump administration, the trading bloc will require exporters to disclose their emissions of the fossil fuel gas methane starting in 2027, with the goal of limiting emissions by 2030. Companies planning to use GHGRP data will now likely have to pay a third party for emissions accounting, according to industry analysts.

The short-sightedness of rolling back the GHGRP is reminiscent of the administration’s termination of several regulations requiring companies to measure and disclose climate-related financial risks. Many of the countries the US does business with have adopted such regulations, putting the US at a disadvantage. According to the Climate Policy Monitor, an initiative based at the UK’s Oxford University that tracks climate-related policies across the world, at least nine countries and regions—including Brazil, China, South Korea, and the EU—require companies to disclose the physical risks that climate change poses to their operations and business. Public procurement contracts also increasingly contain sustainability requirements, meaning “potentially huge amounts of public spending are being re-routed towards products and suppliers that align with national climate objectives,” according to the Monitor’s 2024 report. .

Studies have determined that accounting and disclosure programs like GHGRP are effective in changing corporate behavior. One study found that facilities reduced their emissions by almost 8 percent within two years of reporting under the program, spurred by benchmarking against peers and concerns about legislation. Requiring companies to measure and disclose risk-inducing externalities like global warming emissions brings other benefits to companies as well.

A Columbia University review of mandatory, quantitative, and uniform disclosures found they can lead to “increased market share for a corporation that privately anticipates the economic consequences of disclosure, benchmarks its own performance relative to its competitors, and responds to public signals from investors, consumers, and regulators.” As the old saying goes, you can’t manage what you don’t measure.

Stopping reporting won’t stop global warming

The need for companies to disclose emissions and climate-related risks is more urgent than ever. Global warming emissions continue to rise despite the proliferation of voluntary carbon-cutting pledges that financial institutions and other companies signed on to at the behest of their shareholders and consumers. Voluntary target-setting was never going to provide a lasting solution to climate change, but it often laid the groundwork for lasting regulations, which motivated many companies to take part.

Meanwhile, the costs of climate change continue to accrue. The global insurance provider Swiss Re calculated that losses from natural catastrophes like hurricanes Milton and Helene reached $318 billion in 2024 alone, and are set to increase around 6 percent annually. Science has shown that climate change makes these catastrophes more frequent and severe, and the field of attribution science is increasingly able to tie climate impacts and extreme events to specific companies’ emissions.

Using Carbon Majors, a database of carbon emissions dating back to the start of the Industrial Revolution, UCS has shown that just 122 fossil fuel and cement companies are responsible for 94% of industrial carbon dioxide emissions since 1959. Scientists are able to use the Carbon Majors database to quantify contributions of these companies to sea level rise, areas burned by wildfires, and other climate-related harms. Such research can inform dozens of lawsuits aiming to hold fossil fuel companies accountable—lawsuits that some elected officials and politicians are trying to derail by protecting companies with a liability shield.

The tragedy of energy transition delay

The Trump Administration’s anti-sustainability intimidation tactics have pushed many companies to abandon their voluntary commitments, leading groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance to suspend operations. This concerning trend led 54 groups (including the Union of Concerned Scientists) to call on central bank leaders and financial system regulators to require mandatory emissions disclosure rules and climate transition plans that prioritize financing of renewables over fossil fuels.

The initiative was sparked by the tenth anniversary of a speech by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney when he was governor of the Bank of England. The speech, titled “Tragedy of the Horizon,” discusses how the dangers of climate change extend beyond the political, business and financial cycles.

“We don’t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors, imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix,” Carney said. Making companies provide information about their emissions and related risks can create that incentive, however. “By managing what gets measured, we can break the Tragedy of the Horizon,” he said.

Carney emphasized that starting the energy transition early and keeping it on a predictable path is critical for minimizing risks to financial stability. Climate risk doesn’t just influence the financial system: decisions made within the financial system influence climate risk. By delaying the energy transition, the Trump Administration is exacerbating climate catastrophes while harming the economy by distorting markets. At the end of the day, that choice is bad for corporations’ bottom-lines and devastating for the billions of people around the globe who will continue to suffer greater floods, fires, and heatwaves for every degree the planet warms.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blog-Thumbnail-Carbon-Reduction-Icons-Dilok-KlaisatapornGetty-Images.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 14:03:47.459512

The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country.
In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales.
According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions.
But without federal support, the US is likely to continue lagging behind global EV leaders like China.","(TNS) — On Wednesday, federal EV tax credits in the US officially came to an end.

Those credits, expanded and extended in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, gave drivers up to $7,500 in credits toward the purchase of a new electric vehicle. They’ve been a major force in cutting the up-front costs of EVs, pushing more people toward purchasing them and giving automakers confidence that demand would be strong.

The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country. And transportation is a major contributor to US climate pollution, with cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes together making up roughly 30% of total greenhouse-gas emissions.

To anticipate what’s next for the US EV market, we can look to countries like Germany, which have ended similar subsidy programs. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably going to be a rough end to the year.)

When you factor in fuel savings, the lifetime cost of an EV can already be lower than that of a gas-powered vehicle today. But EVs can have a higher up-front cost, which is why some governments offer a tax credit or rebate that can help boost adoption for the technology.

In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales. While the program was active, drivers could get grants of up to about €6,000 toward the purchase of a new battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle.

Eventually, the government began pulling back the credits. Support for plug-in hybrids ended in 2022, and commercial buyers lost eligibility in September 2023. Then the entire program came to a screeching halt in December 2023, when the government announced it would be ending the incentives with about one week’s notice.

Monthly sales data shows the fingerprints of those changes. In each case where there’s a contraction of public support, there’s a peak in sales just before a cutback, then a crash after. These short-term effects can be dramatic: There were about half as many battery-electric vehicles sold in Germany in January 2024 than there were in December 2023.

We’re already seeing the first half of this sort of boom-bust cycle in the US: EV sales ticked up in August, making up about 10% of all new vehicle sales, and analysts say September will turn out to be a record-breaking month. People rushed to take advantage of the credits while they still could.

Next comes the crash—the next few months will probably be very slow for EVs. One analyst predicted to the Washington Post that the figure could plummet to the low single digits, “like 1 or 2%.”

Ultimately, it’s not terribly surprising that there are local effects around these policy changes. “The question is really how long this decline will last, and how slowly any recovery in the growth will be,” Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway who collects EV sales data, said in an email.

When I spoke to experts (including Andrew) for a story last year, several told me that Germany’s subsidies were ending too soon, and that they were concerned about what cutting off support early would mean for the long-term prospects of the technology in the country. And Germany was much further along than the US, with EVs making up 20% of new vehicle sales—twice the American proportion.

EV growth did see a longer-term backslide in Germany after the end of the subsidies. Battery-electric vehicles made up 13.5% of new registrations in 2024, down from 18.5% the year before, and the UK also passed Germany to become Europe’s largest EV market.

Things have improved this year, with sales in the first half beating records set in 2023. But growth would need to pick up significantly for Germany to reach its goal of getting 15 million battery-electric vehicles registered in the country by 2030. As of January 2025, that number was just 1.65 million.

According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions. Sales of battery-electric vehicles could be about 40% lower in 2030 without the credits than what we’d see with them, according to one analysis by Princeton University’s Zero Lab.

Some US states still have their own incentive programs for people looking to buy electric vehicles. But without federal support, the US is likely to continue lagging behind global EV leaders like China.

As Andrew put it: “From a climate perspective, with road transport responsible for almost a quarter of US total emissions, leaving the low-hanging fruit on the tree is a significant setback.”

This effort marks a milestone on the path to electrification, will help create more green jobs, and promote a just transition in urban logistics.

The collaboration, focused on implementing, diversifying, and scaling the use of charging hubs, will integrate companies of all sizes with electric vehicle fleets into Mexico’s most robust and reliable charging network — the VEMO Charging Network (VCN) — to reduce emissions and demonstrate that the shift to electric fleets is possible, affordable, and necessary.

Over a three-month period, two leading companies in the sector will test the charging infrastructure under real operating conditions, generating key data on operational and financial efficiency, usability, sustainability, and emissions reductions. These results will benefit the companies involved and contribute to the objectives and targets of Mexico City’s Climate Action Program. Building on the pilot’s findings, the partners aim to encourage more companies to join the electric-charging ecosystem, fostering cleaner freight fleets and replicable experiences that deliver environmental benefits in other Mexican and Latin American cities.

“This step through the Laneshift initiative represents an evolution of the joint work between VEMO and The Climate Pledge, of which we have been signatories since 2024. Our goal with this alliance is to ensure that companies with heavy-duty electric fleets have access to reliable and affordable charging infrastructure. We want to remove daily operational barriers to accelerate the transition toward cleaner, more efficient mobility,” said Constantino Rodríguez, Commercial Head at VEMO, Mexico’s leading cleantech driving the transition to clean mobility in Latin America.

The project is part of Laneshift, an initiative led by C40 and The Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, which seeks to decarbonize medium- and heavy-duty freight transport and optimize routes in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico. Laneshift works with key stakeholders to reduce gaps in access to charging infrastructure and advance the decarbonization of the freight transport sector.

“This type of alliance shows how climate action can translate into concrete, ambitious solutions. This demonstration project accelerates the transition to last-mile electric fleets and contributes to Mexico City’s climate goals. At the same time, it improves air quality, creates green jobs, and expands access to charging infrastructure in cities — promoting a just and inclusive transition,” said Cristina Argudo, Interim Regional Director for Latin America at C40.

“At C40, in collaboration with The Climate Pledge, we are truly excited about this partnership with a signatory company like VEMO. This charging hub is a strategic solution to accelerate electromobility and decarbonize freight transport in the region, making a significant contribution to our objectives,” she concluded.

Sarah Dimson-Tararuj, Head of Strategic Projects and Programs at The Climate Pledge–Amazon, added: “The commitment of companies like VEMO highlights the power of cross-sector collaboration to meet the ambitious target of The Climate Pledge: net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The Laneshift initiative in Mexico City helps send clear demand signals for the development of fast-charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the region. The project also seeks to incentivize investment and promote effective public policies that will enable the scale-up of electric vehicles in the logistics and transport sector.”

Key facts:

· Up to 1,890 tCO₂e annual emissions reduction projected, according to C40 estimates.

· Open invitation for companies of all sizes to charge their freight fleets.

· Core to Laneshift’s strategy to close infrastructure and financing gaps for freight electrification.

The transport sector consumes 45% of energy in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico and is the main source of combustion-related air pollution, according to the latest Emissions Inventory.

The US EV maker reported deliveries of 497,099, up seven percent from the year-ago level, reversing a series of declines in three straight quarters attributed partly to backlash to CEO Elon Musk’s political activism.

While the figures did not break down sales by region, automakers saw a jump in US electric vehicle sales due to the September 30 expiration of a tax credit under legislation backed by President Donald Trump.

Recent quarters have seen Tesla sales sink as the company faced blowback over Musk’s embrace of far-right political figures. Musk officially left his position with the Trump administration in May.

Tesla’s results have also been buffeted by rising competition in China from Chinese EV manufacturers and tepid demand for the Cybertruck, a futuristic stainless steel vehicle championed by the controversial CEO.

Musk has touted Tesla’s potential for great growth due to its autonomous driving and artificial intelligence technology, but some analysts have expressed disappointment at the lack of progress on developing EVs at lower retail prices — long a stated goal of the company.

Tesla’s latest batch of sales figures “smashed expectations,” said a note from Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Matt Britzman that pointed out the “rush” of sales due to the US tax credit expiration.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” Britzman said.

– Higher prices ahead? –

Musk in July warned that Tesla faced a potentially “rough” period in terms of financial results once the tax credit expires. Trump’s sweeping fiscal package enacted in July the phaseout of a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 per vehicle.

On Wednesday, Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis were among the companies to report higher US sales in the third quarter, along with foreign brands such as Toyota, Honda and Kia that are significant players in the US market.

The third-quarter surge from the EV credit expiration is reminiscent of a sales uptick in the second quarter as consumers rushed to showrooms to beat out tariffs announced by Trump.

The annualized auto average sales rate rose to 16.4 million in September, topping expectations, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note Thursday.

But the report, which also cited a buoyant stock market as supportive of sales, predicted “eventual moderation, likely as soon as October, as EV sales normalize lower.”

Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said solid 2025 sales thus far reflect “a stronger than expected economy and auto market” during a briefing last week ahead of the sales figures.

But Smoke said automakers still face questions on how much of the tariff hit to pass on to consumers after largely absorbing the costs so far. New tariffs add around $5,500 in costs to the average imported vehicle.

Smoke said the average US consumer is likely to see a four to six percent increase in average prices by this time next year, with some models up eight percent.

Cox analysts highlighted the introduction of 2026 models as a likely opportunity to hike prices, noting that retail inventories are “relatively tight” and stand below year-ago levels.

Here’s what’s in store for you as you start your day:

Premium tax credits, work requirements, and rescission disputes are at the center of the government shutdown

First time since 2009 that an incumbent is not on the ballot for King County, Washington executive

An overview of the rules, agency documents, and notices published in the Federal Register last quarter

Premium tax credits, work requirements, and rescission disputes are at the center of the government shutdown

The federal government shut down at midnight on Oct. 1 after Congress did not pass a continuing resolution (CR) that would have kept government agencies open through Nov. 21. When that occurs, the Antideficiency Act prohibits the federal government from entering into a contract that is not fully funded. According to the Congressional Budget Office, an estimated 750,000 employees could also be furloughed. The last federal government shutdown occurred in 2018 when the government shut down for 35 days.

Today, we'll examine some of the policy disputes reportedly at the center of the funding conflict.

Republicans have said they want a clean CR, meaning a resolution extending all appropriations as Congress last passed them in March, with limited policy changes. On Sept. 19, the House passed a CR extending appropriations at current levels, apart from increased security appropriations for lawmakers, Supreme Court Justices, and executive branch officials.

Senate Democrats have advocated for changes in at least three policy areas in the next CR: premium tax credits, Medicaid work requirements, and presidential pocket rescissions.

Premium tax credits

Senate Democratic leaders said they would not vote for the appropriations bill to prevent the government from shutting down unless it halted the expiration of expanded premium tax credits (ePTCs) at the end of 2025. Some Republicans have said they are open to discussing extending the credits, but that a stopgap continuing resolution is not the right place for such a change. Other Republicans have said they believe Democrats want to provide health care coverage to people living in the U.S. without legal permission.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the premium tax credit “is a refundable credit that helps eligible individuals and families cover the premiums for their health insurance purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace.” In this context, refundable means that the credit may be used even if the individual owes no tax for the year.

The credit, in its most commonly used form, is advanceable, meaning that payments for the credit may be disbursed throughout the year, not just when individuals file their taxes. In these cases, the federal government pays the credit directly to the individual’s health insurance provider.

Congress established PTC's with the Affordable Care Act in 2010, and they first became available for tax year 2014 to filers with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL).

The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), signed in March 2021, created the expanded premium tax credit (ePTC) for tax years 2021 and 2022. It expanded the credit to those making more than 400% of the FPL if they couldn’t qualify for other government plans and could not otherwise purchase insurance with premiums not exceeding a certain percentage of household income. The bill also eliminated premiums for individuals and households claiming income between 100% and 150% of the FPL.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extended the ePTC through the end of 2025, at which point the original ACA provisions of the tax credit will take effect.

Medicaid changes

Democrats have said they want to reverse the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's (OBBBA) changes to Medicaid work requirements. Republicans have said they still want work requirements for “able-bodied, non-working adults.”

Medicaid work requirements are policies that require certain adult enrollees to work or participate in related activities to be eligible for Medicaid benefits. These activities may include employment, job training, education, or community service. The OBBBA, signed in 2025, created the first federally mandated Medicaid work requirements. The law requires states to implement a monthly 80-hour community engagement requirement for adults in the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion group by Jan. 1, 2027. States may apply for a good-faith delay until Dec. 31, 2028. Georgia is the only state with an active state-level Medicaid work requirement, though 13 states have previously sought waivers from the federal government to implement them.

Rescission

Rescission is the process through which a president can request the cancellation of congressionally-appropriated funds. A pocket rescission is when the president requests that Congress rescind unspent funds fewer than 45 days before the funds are scheduled to expire (usually Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year). On Aug. 29, the White House announced that it was canceling $4.9 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign aid through pocket rescission.

Democrats have said that they want to make it harder to rescind funds and reverse President Trump’s use of the pocket rescission. Some Republicans have said they oppose Trump’s use of the pocket rescission and called it illegal. Others have said they agree with Trump’s announced cuts, but that they disagree with the use of the pocket rescission. A representative of the Office of Management and Budget called the pocket rescission a “lawful tool available to the executive branch to reduce unnecessary spending.”

In recent years, executive and legislative branch officials have debated the legality of pocket rescission. As recently as August, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a nonpartisan independent agency within the legislative branch, wrote that pocket rescission is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act. Officials with the executive branch Office of Management and Budget said pocket rescission is legal and said the GAO did not dispute this when presidents used the tool in the 1970s.

First time since 2009 that an incumbent is not on the ballot for King County, Washington executive

Claudia Balducci and Girmay Zahilay are running in the nonpartisan general election for King County, Washington, executive on Nov. 4, 2025.

This is the first open race for the office since 2009. Dow Constantine held the office from that 2009 election until his resignation in March 2025. The King County Council appointed Shannon Braddock interim county executive on April 1. Braddock did not run for election following her appointment.

The county executive is the chief executive officer of the county. The executive has the power to sign and veto ordinances, and appoint various county officers, commissioners, and board members.

Balducci and Zahilay advanced from the eight-candidate primary on Aug. 5. Zahilay received 44.2% of the vote, and Balducci received 29.8%. Though the position is officially nonpartisan, both Balducci and Zahilay are Democrats.

Balducci and Zahilay currently serve on the King County Council. The Cascadia Advocate's Henry Leyden writes, ""[Balducci and Zahilay] have repeatedly voiced agreement on values, principles, and policy directions. Both are emphasizing housing, public safety, and transportation as priorities in their campaigns, and both would govern as progressives. That has led many Democratic activists and nonprofit leaders to conclude that King County will be in good hands regardless of which frontrunner prevails.""

Despite these similarities, Democrats and progressive organizations have split their endorsements between the two. Notable endorsements for Balducci include Washington Auditor Pat McCarthy (D), U.S. Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D), The Seattle Times, and SEIU Local 925. Notable endorsements for Zahilay include Gov. Bob Ferguson (D), Washington Attorney General Nick Brown (D), U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D), and Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.

Balducci is a labor attorney and was elected to King County Council District 6 in 2015. Balducci’s priorities include:

Law enforcement and crime prevention

Behavioral health responses

Cost of living

Affordable Housing

Convenient and sustainable transportation

Zahilay is a business attorney and was elected to King County Council District 2 in 2019. The council unanimously appointed him chair on Jan. 14, 2025. Zahilay’s priorities include:

Public safety

Attracting employers and supporting small businesses

Labor standards and promoting a healthy workforce

The county executive serves four-year terms. The winner of this election will only serve a three-year term because of Amendment 1, which voters passed in 2022. Amendment 1 moved King County elections from odd years to even years. The winner of the county executive election in 2028 will return to serving a four-year term.

An overview of the rules, agency documents, and notices published in the Federal Register last quarter

The federal government added 19,256 pages to the Federal Register last quarter for a year-to-date total of 47,228 pages. The Federal Register hit an all-time high of 95,894 pages in 2016. The Federal Register is a daily journal of federal government activity that includes presidential documents, proposed and final rules, and public notices. It is a common measure of an administration’s regulatory activity, accounting for both regulatory and deregulatory actions.

Here’s a look at changes to the federal register from the last quarter, spanning from July 1 to Sept. 20, and how that compares to the third quarter of 2021, the first year of the Biden Administration.

The government added 6,838 documents to the Federal Register this quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, the government added 7,119 documents, bringing the year-to-date page total to 54,338.

Here’s a breakdown of the 6,838 documents added last quarter:

5,467 notices

92 presidential documents

496 proposed rules

783 final rules

During the third quarter of 2021, the government added fewer presidential documents (68), more proposed rules (517), and more final rules (864).

Agencies proposed 28 significant rules and issued 25 significant final rules this quarter. A 1993 executive order defines significant rules as those that can potentially have large effects on the economy, environment, public health, or state or local governments.

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) determines which rules meet this definition and are subject to its review. Significant actions may also conflict with presidential priorities or other agency rules.

As of Sept. 30, the Trump administration has issued 43 significant proposed rules, 65 significant final rules, and seven significant notices this year.",https://ballotpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/c/c0/DailyBrewMainImage.png,N,,2025-10-02 13:05:26.135026

Tesla reported quarterly vehicle deliveries up 7% over the year prior for the period ended Tuesday, the same day that a key tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles in the U.S. expired.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2025: 497,099

Total production Q3 2025: 447,450

Shares sank Thursday following the report. Tesla plans to update investors on its third-quarter financial results on Oct. 22.

The company reported 462,890 total deliveries in the third quarter of 2024. Tesla saw a decline in production this quarter compared to the 469,796 vehicles produced last year.

The Elon Musk-led company was expected to report around 447,600 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.

An independent researcher who publishes as Troy Teslike on Patreon predicted 481,000 deliveries for the quarter. Tesla distributed a company-compiled consensus on Sept. 26, which said analysts were expecting 443,079 deliveries.

The company doesn't break out sales and production by model or region. However, Tesla said it produced 435,826 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars. Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.

Tesla's third quarter was hampered by a continuing sales slump in Europe driven partly by consumer backlash against Musk and his incendiary political rhetoric and activism, as well by competition from EV makers like Volkswagen and BYD, which are picking up market share.

The slowdown in Europe was partially offset in the U.S., where buyers rushed to purchase EVs ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit, which ended as part of President Donald Trump's spending bill passed in July.

Earlier this week, Ford said sales of its all-electric vehicles increased by 30.2% during the period to help it notch a fresh quarterly record of more than 30,600 units, still lagging far behind Tesla.

Tesla's stock price has been on a tear of late, jumping 40% in the third quarter and turning positive for the year following a brutal first three months of 2025. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is up 14% this year, compared to the Nasdaq's 18% gain.

In the second quarter, Tesla reported 384,122 deliveries, a 14% year-over-year decline and the second straight quarterly drop.

In Tesla's energy business, the company said it deployed 12.5 GWh of its storage products, including its Megapack and new Megablock systems, which are backup batteries that store energy alongside businesses or utility-scale facilities.

Musk's xAI has been a big buyer of Tesla's battery energy storage systems in recent quarters.

Tesla's Megapacks generally store electricity produced by renewable sources, like wind turbines or solar panels, for later use. They can also store electricity produced during lower-demand periods to be used during peak hours, helping defray some of the costs.

The company said it deployed 9.6 GWh of energy storage products in the second quarter of 2025, and 6.9 GWh of energy storage products during the third quarter of last year.

The imminent end to US tax credits for the purchase of electric cars has brought car manufacturer Tesla a sales record after months of falling numbers.

Deliveries by the company led by Elon Musk rose by 7.4% year-on-year to 497,099 vehicles in the past quarter.

Analysts had expected a decline of around 5% on average.

In each of the first two quarters of the year, Tesla deliveries had fallen by around 13%.

Analysts had already assumed that some prospective buyers in the United States would buy before the $7,500 tax credit expired at the end of September.

However, the majority of them thought that sales were likely to fall nevertheless. The question now is what potentially early purchases will mean for sales in the current quarter and beyond.

Musk had already said that he was expecting some tough quarters ahead.

However, the tech billionaire has long played down the importance of car sales for the company.

The future of Tesla will lie in robotaxis and humanoid robots, Musk has claimed. However, the company is only just starting out in both areas - and is facing a lot of competition.

In total, Tesla built 447,410 cars of all models last quarter, around 4.8% fewer cars than in the previous year.

In the first quarter, the transition phase for the best-selling Model Y was seen as one reason for the decline, alongside the controversies surrounding the political activities of Musk, the chief executive of Tesla.

But even in the second quarter, with stable production of the Model Y, things did not go any better.

Tesla is facing more and more competition from other manufacturers in the electric car business - while the pioneer's model range is hardly changing, at least visually.

In addition, many buyers in the important US market are opting for vehicles with hybrid drives or combustion engines.

Tesla's futuristic-looking Cybertruck electric pickup is not a sales hit either.

In Europe, Tesla is continuing its rapid decline. According to figures from the industry association ACEA, new registrations in the European Union fell by 36.6% year-on-year to 8,220 vehicles in August.

In July, there was a drop of some 42%. Tesla's share of the EU car market has now fallen to 1.2%

Tesla has its European plant in Grünheide near Berlin. The company itself does not provide any information on results in individual regions and countries.

Late last year, Labour also removed the 29% investment allowance on oil and gas operations, further stifling investment in the UK North Sea.

“What happens to North Sea energy doesn’t begin and end in Aberdeen.","Europe’s oil capital since the 1970s, Aberdeen in Scotland, had not fully recovered from the 2015-2016 price crash when the pandemic triggered another downturn five years later.

Aberdeen and the surrounding Aberdeenshire area have been losing oil and gas jobs since the 2010s, but lately, pessimism has increased among companies in the region as Aberdeen’s fortunes have been closely tied to the energy sector’s prosperity.

The UK government says it seeks a Just Transition for the North Sea workers, but while some are transferring to renewable energy jobs, many others are quitting the energy sector altogether or moving out of Scotland and into lower-tax jurisdictions such as the top OPEC producers in the Persian Gulf.

“The delay in investment in renewables is leading to a number of skilled workers moving away,” Chris Comfort, partner at Aberdeen–based property and legal firm Aberdein Considine, told the Financial Times.

Since the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), or the windfall tax, was initially introduced by the Conservative government at the height of the energy crisis in 2022, oil and gas companies operating in the UK North Sea have been calling for certainty in the regulatory and tax framework. Recent changes in policies and the rising taxes imposed by the current Labour government have driven away operators, who say that a lack of North Sea investments would only make the UK more dependent on oil and gas imports.

Late last year, Labour also removed the 29% investment allowance on oil and gas operations, further stifling investment in the UK North Sea.

The main offshore energy industries association, OEUK, says the frequent changes in the UK tax regime, uncertainty about said taxation going forward, and the plans to ban new field development have been bigger hurdles to boosting domestic oil and gas production and reducing import dependence than the fact that the North Sea is one of the world’s most mature and developed oil and gas basins.

The government has launched a consultation on what type of tax regime should come next, and is being urged to replace the windfall tax as soon as practicable – and not wait until 2030 – to avoid the demise of the UK oil and gas industry.

“We need pragmatic action before it’s too late. We’re seeing jobs and money leave the UK at unacceptable levels,” OEUK chief executive David Whitehouse wrote in a letter to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier this week.

“What happens to North Sea energy doesn’t begin and end in Aberdeen. It ripples through our industrial spine, across sectors and into Grangemouth, Humberside, Teesside, Tyneside, East Anglia and the North West. It undermines the homegrown manufacture of things like fuels, chemicals and pharmaceuticals as well as our energy future.”

What happens in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire is that Aberdeen City and neighboring Aberdeenshire will continue to struggle, EY said in a report at the end of 2024. Aberdeen has lost nearly 18,000 jobs since 2010, equivalent to 10% of its workforce in 2010, largely due to the ongoing decline in the local oil and gas industry, the consultancy said.

“Aberdeen’s prospects remain heavily tied to the energy sector” with growth predicted to be below the Scottish average between 2024 and 2029, EY reckons.

Business confidence in the Northeast is at some of its lowest levels since the pandemic, as a sharp downturn in North Sea activity – a direct result of the increased tax on oil and gas operators to 78% – is damaging the wider economy in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, according to the Q2 North-east Quarterly Economic Survey run by?Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce in partnership with law firm?Gilson Gray LLP.

“The UK economy cannot afford to turn its back on the North Sea – nor on the thousands of businesses in this region that depend on it,” said Russell?Borthwick, Chief Executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce.

Findlay Anderson, Partner at Gilson Gray LLP, commented, “The Energy Profits Levy, coupled with increased employment costs and policy volatility, is creating an environment where firms feel unable to plan ahead.”

,EVs,2025-10-02 16:01:18+00:00,Denver 7 Colorado News (KMGH),Colorado announces new electric vehicle rebates in response to federal tax credits expiring,"Anusha Roy, anusha-roy",,,,,https://www.denver7.com/money/consumer/colorado-announces-new-electric-vehicle-rebates-in-response-to-federal-tax-credits-expiring,"DENVER — The State of Colorado is announcing a new electric vehicle rebate within two days of federal tax credits expiring under the new federal tax and spending plan.
The announcement comes within 48 hours of federal tax credits expiring.
“Come January 1, the state tax credit will go down to $750 as a base tax credit, the extra $2,500 for lower cost vehicles will remain so up to $3,250 through the state tax credit.
Toor had mentioned to Denver7 months ago, the state was working on a solution to federal tax credits expiring.
We don't have the financial ability to just replace those federal tax credits,” Toors said.","DENVER — The State of Colorado is announcing a new electric vehicle rebate within two days of federal tax credits expiring under the new federal tax and spending plan.

Starting on November 3, the Vehicle Exchange Colorado rebates will increase from $6,000 to $9,000 for new EV purchase and leases and $4,000 to $6,000 for used EV purchases and leases.

Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor said this program is designed specifically to help lower-income Coloradans.

“For people who make up to 80% of area median income, who are turning in an older polluting gasoline vehicle, will be able to get up to a $9,000 rebate towards a new electric vehicle, that's up from $6,000 which is the current level, or up to $6,000 for used electric vehicle, which is an increase from the current level of $4,000,” Toor said.

The energy office said the program launched in summer 2023 and more than 2,700 Coloradans have traded in a qualified old or high-emitting vehicle to purchase or lease an EV.

The announcement comes within 48 hours of federal tax credits expiring. Changes to state tax credits are also on the horizon.

“Come January 1, the state tax credit will go down to $750 as a base tax credit, the extra $2,500 for lower cost vehicles will remain so up to $3,250 through the state tax credit. We anticipate New Vehicle Change Colorado rebate amounts remaining as we go into the new year,” said Toor.

The new rebate is in state plans through 2032, but could be adjusted depending on the EV market, the landscape with tax credits and demand.

Toor had mentioned to Denver7 months ago, the state was working on a solution to federal tax credits expiring. He said they were able to find money from the transportation electrification enterprises funded by fee revenues that by law has to go to transportation electrification programs. Toor said as the state goes through a budget shortfall, the rebates do not rely on general fund money.

“It’s an existing program that had an existing budget, and we had a bit of room in the budget. We were able to sort of make this pivot to increase the rebates for Vehicle Exchange Colorado. There's obviously a tougher challenge when it comes to addressing the much broader population of everybody who wants an electric vehicle. We don't have the financial ability to just replace those federal tax credits,” Toors said.

In the meantime, the state hopes people will take advantage of the larger state credits before they expire at the end of the year.

In a statement Governor Polis wrote:

“The market has made it clear, EVs are here to stay. Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost. I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: get out there right now.”

“For light duty vehicles in the U.S., we see roughly 60 to 68% lower emissions from electric vehicles versus gas powered vehicles,” Ed Piersa, with the energy office, added. “So this is all the more reason all of the goals that will pointed out are extremely important to the state.""

State leaders said to date, there are more than 200,000 EVs registered in Colorado and that EVs made up a quarter of new car sales so far in 2025.

They hope the new rebate will help keep the momentum up of reaching nearly a million EVs on Colorado roads by 2030.

If you would like to take advantage of the new rebates come November 3, Piersa said there are a few steps you need to follow.

“It's applied at the time of the transaction, and vehicle exchange Colorado participant needs to be approved by the program prior to going to an authorized automobile dealer. And we have 175 authorized automobile dealers to date,” he said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/443ee37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+48/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F7b%2F33da916e40be801ce09362103bf7%2F10-01-25-ev-federal-rebates.png,N,,2025-10-02 13:04:38.386636

Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the US, pushing the timing by several months.","Tesla’s third-quarter deliveries trounced Wall Street estimates on Thursday after several quarters of weak performance, powered by an unusual sales boost from US electric vehicle buyers rushing to lock in popular tax credits before they expire at the end of September.

Tesla said it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, up 7.4% from 462,890 a year earlier. It also delivered 481,166 units of its Model 3 compact sedan and Model Y crossover in the September quarter, well above Wall Street expectations. The carmaker is set to report quarterly results on 22 October.

Full-year 2025 deliveries are projected to be about 1.61m, roughly 10% below 2024, according to investment research firm Visible Alpha. Tesla will need to deliver 389,498 vehicles in the December quarter to meet that projection.

Elon Musk’s carmaker had frequently talked up the expiry, using it alongside discounts and financing deals to spur sales and leases of its electric vehicles. However, worries over cooling sales in the upcoming quarters due to the withdrawal of the $7,500 federal tax credit weighed on the company’s shares, which fell in morning trading.

“While the third quarter was strong, we expect fourth quarter sales will see a decline, consistent with the first half of the year, largely due to the US tax credit expiration,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

Tesla had reported declining delivery numbers in recent quarters as it failed to refresh an ageing lineup of vehicles and suffered global backlash against Musk’s heavy involvement in politics. The company’s newest model, the Cybertruck, has not succeeded in significantly boosting sales.

Europe remained a weak spot as rivals aggressively promoted plug-in hybrids, while Chinese EV brands started gaining ground in the extremely competitive market. Tesla’s European sales, including the UK, fell 22.5% from a year earlier in August, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the region’s Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

In China, Tesla began delivering the long-wheelbase, six-seat Model Y L in September, a family-focused variant that was expected to spur demand in the world’s largest EV market. Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the US, pushing the timing by several months.

Analysts said Tesla’s ability to cushion a post-credit slowdown will depend heavily on its push into lower-priced models.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.

The stripped-down version is designed to be roughly 20% cheaper to produce than the refreshed Model Y and could scale to about 250,000 units a year in the US by 2026.

Tesla holdings account for the bulk of Musk’s wealth and a recent surge in the company’s stock price helped his net worth breach the $500bn mark on Wednesday, bolstering his position as the world’s richest person.

As of last close, shares of the company were up nearly 14% this year.

The company’s board has proposed a shareholder vote on a new CEO award that could grant Musk about 12% of the company, worth up to $1tn, if performance and valuation targets are met.

Do you believe that hybrid sales will eat up the market share that the tax credit was responsible for, or will folks go back to gas?","Americans are in a bit of a pickle. While the rest of the world is still pushing forward with electric vehicles, the U.S. governemnt has done away with one of the biggest driving forces here: the EV tax credit. That means that the tech will soon need to thrive on its own merit—the biggest barrier, of course, being cost.

Car companies are working on this, though. They know that EVs need to be cheaper, especially now that Uncle Sam's wallet is officially closed. But U.S. automakers may be catching up to the production costs that seasoned Chinese automakers are paying to build comparable cars in North America.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Also on deck: Tesla's Q3 could be its saving grace for 2025 and a new startup is helping to slash the cost of LFP batteries. Let's jump in.

30%: Ford Says Its $30,000 EV Pickup Will Match BYD's Production Costs

Ford CEO Jim Farley just had a huge, chest-thumping moment for America's EV industry on TV. According to Farley, the automaker's new Universal EV Platform can match the production costs of BYD's made-in-Mexico EVs.

This isn't the first time that Ford has talked up its ability to take on China with new EV underpinnings. In fact, the Universal EV Platform was a direct response to China's ability to build uber-cheap EVs and sell them around the world, effectively undercutting the global auto market with reckless abandon. And it's also Ford's secret weapon in launching its $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.

Here's the snippet from Farley's interview with CNBC's Squawk Box:

We just launched the universal electric vehicle platform in Louisville. We think it's the same cost as a BYD made in Mexico. We're trying to out-innovate our competitors like BYD.

I don't think we can stand still. We can't rely on a North America or US-only market. Companies like Ford have to out-innovate our Chinese competitors. We're already facing them in in Australia, New Zealand, in Thailand. They're subsidized vehicles. It's happening already.

Farley is essentially declaring war on the auto industry's boogeyman by targeting the holy grail target of affordability: $30,000. There's no tax credit helping with that number any longer, either. Washington has officially pulled that plug, but that doesn't change the needs of the consumer.

Farley noted that half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imports. And even those manufactured domestically have a significant number of imported parts (between 20% and 30% of Ford's parts are imported, according to the CEO). Meanwhile, vehicles manufactured in China often enjoy $5,000 to $6,000 advantages in labor costs and subsidies, which makes it difficult for American manufacturers to compete—and that's the reason why Ford needs to innovate.

BYD has managed to dominate the global EV market by using its home-turf government-subsidized advantage to offset labor and parts costs. But as BYD begins to move manufacturing into other countries, its costs rise. And this is where Ford recognizes as a prime place to strike.

""We have to face this,"" said Farley. ""What Ford is doing about it—we're not complaining. We're going to take care of this ourselves.""

60%: Tesla's Q3 Is Good, But Don't Call It A Comeback (Yet)

Photo by: Tesla

Tesla's third-quarter results are in, and like other automakers, it saw a surge of buyers trying to secure tax credits while they could. Tesla sold nearly half a million EVs globally in Q3, a new record.

But before anyone declares this a victory lap, it's important to know that Tesla's expected success doesn't mean it's out of the woods after a protracted period of dipping sales. Here's what Reuters reports:

The quarterly tally will help gauge how far U.S. subsidies lifted sales, as China leans on Tesla's expanded six-seater Model Y L launched in September while Europe slumped after the electric-vehicle maker's aging lineup struggled to compete and CEO Elon Musk's politics dampened buyer sentiment.

That has set the stage for weaker third-quarter global deliveries than last year and a potential drop in the December quarter. The expiry of U.S. tax credits likely accelerated purchases that normally would have been made later in the year, rather than attracting new buyers to the brand, analysts said.

Tesla raised car-leasing prices in the U.S., its website showed, after a sweeping legislation passed by Congress ended tax incentives for the EV industry on Tuesday.

Tesla isn't alone at the edge of the cliff. The whole EV sector is running on the fumes of the federal tax credit for years, and while that's done a lot of good for EV adoption in recent years, the next few months are set to be particularly rough.

But where Tesla (like other EV-only brands) is uniquely exposed is its inability to pivot to other powertrains to offset any EV-related losses. Legacy automakers like GM and Ford are pivoting to hybrids while other players like Toyota never left them.

That means that Tesla is faced with deciding what to do next. It could weather the storm in hopes that sales will pick back up in the U.S. without the EV tax credit—something it expected after acknowledging that it's in for ""a few rough quarters."" But margins are becoming thinner and competition is heating up, so maybe Tesla could pull an insane move and do something other than build cars in hopes that it will be more profitable.

Meanwhile, Q3 is going to look like a win. Tesla will finally have a good few months on its books, as will most automakers that benefited from the tax credit, but the real test comes in Q4.

90%: This U.S. Startup Says It Can Beat China's Pricing For EV Batteries

Photo by: CATL

Every single big league automaker on Earth is trying to reduce the costs of its vehicles right now. While today's driving factor is the EV tax credit, the ultimate underlying reasoning is simple. Cheaper components mean more margin, and more margin means more profits. The hard part is actually figuring out how to squeeze costs down even further on the most expensive component in an EV: the battery.

A new company called Electroflow believes that it has figured out how to do this. Not only does the startup say its tech will lead to batteries 40% cheaper to produce than leading Chinese firms, but it believes it can do that with a U.S.-based supply chain.

TechCrunch's interview with the company's co-founder shows what Electroflow has up its sleeve:

“We think LFP is the missing ingredient for energy prosperity. The problem is it’s literally 99% made in China,” Eric McShane, co-founder and CEO of Electroflow, told TechCrunch. “If we want to have a chance of competing, we’ve got to flip that script.”

McShane and his co-founder, Evan Gardner, have developed a technology they think is capable of undercutting Chinese producers on cost by removing several steps in the production process. If they can deliver, they could reduce the cost of an LPF battery by as much as 20% while building a domestic supply chain.

“We looked at the whole process of mining, starting from the rock or the salt water and getting all the way to a lithium chemical. We were like, man, that’s like ten steps,” he said. “That clearly is not the best way to do it.”

The golden standard of lithium refining starts by extracting salty brines from deep underground. The brines are then processed to extricate the lithium contained within, but that process can be lengthy and expensive. Until now, maybe.

China is able to extract and package lithium into the materials needed to build LFP battery packs for around $4,000 per metric ton today. The same amount of that material costs about three times that amount in the U.S.

Electroflow says that its process reduces processing from ten key steps down to just three. And once its process is in full swing, it will be able to get that cost down to around $2,500 per metric ton—about 40% less than China's cost today. In the near term, it expects to reach around $5,000 by the end of the year, which doesn't quite beat out China, but is still a reduction of nearly 60% for domestic production.

TechCrunch explains how Electroflow's tech works:

The startup’s key technology is a cell that contains anodes that, when run in one direction, absorb lithium ions from brines and then, in another, release them into water containing carbonates. When both passes are finished, the result is lithium carbonate that’s ready to be reacted with phosphate, iron, and other reagents to produce LFP powder that’s ready to be shipped to a battery factory. For manufacturers that want to make something other than LFP, Electroflow can stop the process early and just send them lithium carbonate.

The system runs entirely on electricity, and producing 50 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year would require only as much as one U.S. household, McShane said. The water used in the carbonate step can largely be recycled, too. “We don’t use a ton of electricity. We don’t use a ton of water,” he said.

McShane says that a refining system capable of generating around 100 metric tons of processed powder—around $2,500,000 of LFP material—can fit inside a standard 20-foot shipping container.

The tech is definitely the moonshot that the U.S. EV market needs to build cheaper EVs. Electroflow believes in it, and it completed a proof-of-concept in California earlier this year to demonstrate as much. And if it catches on, it could help drive down the cost of EVs in the coming years, especially as automakers domesticate more of the supply chain.

100%: Are Hybrids In For A Few Good Years Ahead?

Photo by: Ralph Hermens

While automakers prepare for EVs to have another resurgence, many are going all-in on hybrids to bridge the gap. In fact, Americans were more interested in hybrids than ever at the start of 2025, a trend that many manufacturers are banking on being a way to still utilize their investment into domestic battery manufacturing despite an anticipated slowdown in EV sales.

Do you believe that hybrid sales will eat up the market share that the tax credit was responsible for, or will folks go back to gas? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/Akn3x2/s1/ford-universal-ev-platform-cm-hero.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 14:02:24.729496

Tesla reported higher global third-quarter auto deliveries on Thursday, joining a broad slate of automakers seeing a surge in electric vehicles ahead of the phaseout of a US tax credit.

The US EV maker reported deliveries of 497,099, up seven percent from the year-ago level, reversing a series of declines in three straight quarters attributed partly to backlash to CEO Elon Musk’s political activism.

While the figures did not break down sales by region, automakers saw a jump in US electric vehicle sales due to the September 30 expiration of a tax credit under legislation backed by President Donald Trump.

Recent quarters have seen Tesla sales sink as the company faced blowback over Musk’s embrace of far-right political figures. Musk officially left his position with the Trump administration in May.

Tesla’s results have also been buffeted by rising competition in China from Chinese EV manufacturers and tepid demand for the Cybertruck, a futuristic stainless steel vehicle championed by the controversial CEO.

Musk has touted Tesla’s potential for great growth due to its autonomous driving and artificial intelligence technology, but some analysts have expressed disappointment at the lack of progress on developing EVs at lower retail prices — long a stated goal of the company.

Tesla’s latest batch of sales figures “smashed expectations,” said a note from Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Matt Britzman that pointed out the “rush” of sales due to the US tax credit expiration.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” Britzman said.

– Higher prices ahead? –

Musk in July warned that Tesla faced a potentially “rough” period in terms of financial results once the tax credit expires. Trump’s sweeping fiscal package enacted in July the phaseout of a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 per vehicle.

On Wednesday, Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis were among the companies to report higher US sales in the third quarter, along with foreign brands such as Toyota, Honda and Kia that are significant players in the US market.

The third-quarter surge from the EV credit expiration is reminiscent of a sales uptick in the second quarter as consumers rushed to showrooms to beat out tariffs announced by Trump.

The annualized auto average sales rate rose to 16.4 million in September, topping expectations, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note Thursday.

But the report, which also cited a buoyant stock market as supportive of sales, predicted “eventual moderation, likely as soon as October, as EV sales normalize lower.”

Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said solid 2025 sales thus far reflect “a stronger than expected economy and auto market” during a briefing last week ahead of the sales figures.

But Smoke said automakers still face questions on how much of the tariff hit to pass on to consumers after largely absorbing the costs so far. New tariffs add around $5,500 in costs to the average imported vehicle.

Smoke said the average US consumer is likely to see a four to six percent increase in average prices by this time next year, with some models up eight percent.

Cox analysts highlighted the introduction of 2026 models as a likely opportunity to hike prices, noting that retail inventories are “relatively tight” and stand below year-ago levels.",https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20190720_132748-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 13:09:50.432330

France is among the most advanced nations in the world in the energy sector and has, for the past decade, been implementing measures to decrease its reliance on fossil fuels and transition to a more environmentally friendly form of energy generation. The offshore wind project in Normandy, known as the Centre Manche 2 (AO8) offshore wind tender, has been sold to a consortium of companies.

France approves the sale of the offshore wind project in a very famous city

Normandy is known around the world as the last stand for the world against the worst form of tyranny we have ever seen; however, since then, the region around Normandy has become a hotbed for the energy sector.

A massive offshore wind project in the region has been sold to a consortium of companies, including one of the largest energy companies in the world, TotalEnergies. Additionally, RWE will also form a part of the deal to acquire the Centre Manche 2 (AO8) offshore wind tender, although the company has stated its plans to exit the consortium, but we digress.

The 1.5 GW offshore wind park off the coast of Normandy will see the consortium taking full advantage of TotalEnergies’ expertise in the field and will design, develop, construct, and operate the wind farm. Additionally, TotalEnergies made a statement on its website that outlines its plans to engage with the local community.

“In the coming months, a dedicated TotalEnergies team, based in Normandy, will continue the consultation work with local and regional stakeholders that began during the tender phase. It will ensure the proper integration of the project into the Normandy region, especially its coexistence with commercial fishing. TotalEnergies will also implement crowdfunding financing that will allow local residents and authorities in the Normandy region to invest in the project and directly contribute to the energy transition of their territory. Additionally, TotalEnergies will fund a €10 million territorial fund to support initiatives in training, education, and culture in Normandy.” – TotalEnergies press release

TotalEnergies aims to make a final investment decision (FID) in early 2029

Once that happens, the company has stated that it estimates the total investment at €4.5 billion, with a state-set tariff of €66/MWh. The country’s second National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), which was published in 2024, noted a target of 41.3% renewable energy in final energy consumption by 2030.

By that time, the offshore wind capacity is projected to reach 3.6 GW. The evidence would suggest, despite the current state of affairs in the United States, that wind power usage will continue to grow.

Following the sale, the heads of TotalEnergies released a statement that outlines their plans for the site.

“We are very proud to have won this tender for the construction of the largest renewable energy park in France to date. It embodies Total’s transformation into TotalEnergies in France. This project will be the largest investment made by TotalEnergies in France in decades and reflects our Company’s deep commitment to our country. As a long-standing player in Normandy, we are determined to mobilize our expertise to ensure this project is an industrial success while securing its acceptance by the region. We will work to support the local industrial ecosystem, which has already developed skills through the first offshore wind projects currently being installed. Finally, this project strengthens our development in green electricity production to offer competitive prices to our French customers”, – Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.

The utility-scale market led the way, setting a record with 4.9 GW installed, enough capacity to power 3.7 million American homes during average peak load demand.

The residential storage market expanded 608 M. This represents a 132 percent increase year-over-year and an 8 percent jump quarter-over-quarter.

Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona and Illinois,

Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets and continued investment tax credit access through third-party ownership.""

Wood Mackenzie projects that these record levels of additional storage capacity will continue into the foreseeable future.

Renewable Energy Jobs grew 3X faster in 2024

Renewable energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy in 2024. However, future growth could be in jeopardy, according to the 10th annual Clean Jobs America report released by E2.

The report showed that the renewable energy sector added almost 100,000 new jobs, bringing the total number of renewable energy workers in the United States to 3.56 million. However, policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth in 2024 led to the growth in renewable energy jobs dropping to its slowest pace since 2020, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023.

More than 7 percent of all new jobs added in the United States and 82 percent of all new energy jobs added last year were in renewable energy occupations.

According to E2, since January 2025, companies canceled more than $22 billion planned clean energy related factories and other projects that were expected to create 16,500 new jobs. Analysis by other organizations estimate more than 830,000 jobs could be lost just because of the energy policy rollbacks in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4.

These federal policy assaults come even as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the fastest-growing occupations in America are wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers.

Global Solar Installations surge 64 percent so far in 2025

While the US is facing increased policy headwinds to the expansion of solar, the rest of the world is setting new capacity records.

China led the pack in solar installations, adding 256 GW so far this year– more than twice as much (67 percent) solar capacity as the rest of the world combined.

India came in second behind China, installing 24 GW, while the U.S. placed third, installing about 21 GWWorldwide, 380 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the first half of this year, marking a 64 percent increase from 2024, when 232 GW was installed in the same timeframe, according to a report from the clean energy think tank Ember.

""In 2024, global solar output rose by 28 percent (+469 TWh) compared to 2023.

Fracking's Broken Promise

In 2013, when the Appalachian fracking rush was still in its early days, then President Barack Obama extolled its benefits in his State of the Union address. Along with the economic benefits of extraction and insulating the nation from the dangers of relying on foreign sources of energy - he noted that ""Nearly everyone's energy bill will be lower because of it.""

And there was indeed a growth in supply. Natural gas production in Pennsylvania more than doubled between 2013 and 2024. The state went all in on natural gas, transitioning its grid to rely on gas for 60 percent of the state's electricity.

But these shifts have not translated to lower electric costs for Pennsylvanians. Comparing average household electricity prices from 2010 to 2024, residents have seen their bills increase dramatically.

After a period of relative stability, Pennsylvania electricity rates have soared since 2020. The average household electricity bill in the state has risen 31 percent in the past five years. Utilities are projecting another 5 percent increase over the next 6 months.

The Elon-Musk-led carmaker had frequently talked up the expiration, using it alongside discounts and financing deals to spur sales and leases of its EVs.

However, worries over cooling sales in the upcoming quarters due to the withdrawal of the $7,500 federal tax credit weighed on the company’s shares, which fell nearly 1% in morning trading.

“While the third quarter was strong, we expect fourth quarter sales will see a decline, consistent with the first half of the year, largely due to the US tax credit expiration,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

Europe remained a weak spot as rivals aggressively promoted plug-in hybrids, while Chinese EV brands started gaining groundin the hyper-competitive market.

The company’s European sales, including the UK, fell 22.5% from a year earlier in August, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the region’s Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

Overall, Tesla said it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, up 7.4% from 462,890 a year earlier.

It also delivered 481,166 units of its Model 3 compact sedan and Model Y crossover in the September quarter, well above Wall Street expectations. The carmaker is set to report quarterly results on October 22.

Full-year 2025 deliveries are projected to be around 1.61 million, roughly 10% below 2024, according to Visible Alpha. Tesla will need to deliver 389,498 vehicles in the December quarter to meet that projection.

In China, Tesla began delivering the long-wheelbase, six-seat Model Y L in September, a family-focused variant that was expected to spur demand in the world’s largest EV market.

Meanwhile, Rivian on Thursday lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast, but beat estimates for quarterly deliveries owing to a boost in demand from buyers rushing to take advantage of tax credits.

Musk and Tesla

Tesla holdings account for the bulk of Musk’s wealth and a recent surge in the company’s stock price helped his net worth breach the $500 billion mark on Wednesday, bolstering his position as the world’s richest person.

As of last close, shares of the company were up nearly 14% this year.

The company’s board has proposed a shareholder vote on a new CEO award that could grant Musk about 12% of the company, worth up to $1 trillion, if performance and valuation targets are met.

The billionaire has tried to position Tesla more as a technology company by focusing on AI-based self-driving systems, robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Cheaper models

Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the US, pushing the timing by several months, with an eventual plan to build the variant in China and Europe.

Analysts said Tesla’s ability to cushion a post-credit slowdown will depend heavily on its push into lower-priced models.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.

The news comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk became the first person whose net worth hit $500 billion this week, indicating his EV company is performing well despite financial troubles earlier this year.

The previous two quarters were characterized by steep declines, fueled by Musk’s brief time in the White House and his association with President Donald Trump. The billionaire’s right-wing views prompted a number of protesters to vandalize Tesla cars and dealerships.

Musk ultimately cut ties with the Trump administration to focus on his businesses, including Tesla. It appears his strategy is working so far, although the automaker’s increased sales may not last very long.

Because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed the tax credits on Tuesday, EV sales are expected to drop in the next few quarters. The Congressional Research Service estimates a 25% to 30% decline.

Despite the negative outlook, Tesla is proceeding with its plans to roll out autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots as part of a new lineup of products. Among them is the Tesla Cybercab, a fully autonomous robotaxi with a similar design to the Cybertruck.

Meanwhile, Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, proposed by Tesla’s board, is up for a shareholder vote in November. The historic pay package is said to keep Musk focused through the company’s next decade of growth.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25226762072622.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-02 13:10:38.066372

The estimate is based on the 45Q tax credit, a federal program that pays companies $85 per metric ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored from industrial and power facilities.
The data lists a total of 43 carbon capture and storage projects and 10 pipelines that will function to transport captured carbon.
Prior to the act, the maximum tax credit available for carbon oxides that were permanently sequestered through EOR projects or other utilization methods was $60 per ton.

The estimate is based on the 45Q tax credit, a federal program that pays companies $85 per metric ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored from industrial and power facilities.

According to project data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project, at least 17 announced projects in Louisiana’s chemical, refining, and liquified natural gas sectors would qualify under the “industry and power” and “direct air capture” category of the credit.

In total, those 17 projects are estimating that some 42 million tons of carbon dioxide would be captured, either for storage or to be reused in other industrial projects.

The data lists a total of 43 carbon capture and storage projects and 10 pipelines that will function to transport captured carbon. Twenty-two of the projects listed include regional “hubs,” an infrastructural network that “takes carbon dioxide from several emitting sources, such as heavy industries and power, and then transports and stores it using common infrastructure,” according to the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.

The 45Q incentive applies once a qualifying project either locks captured carbon underground in approved geological sites – such as saline formations or depleted oil and gas reservoirs – or puts the carbon to work as an input for making low-carbon fuels, chemicals, or construction materials.

The 45Q credit was strengthened in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and reaffirmed this summer in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump. Prior to the act, the maximum tax credit available for carbon oxides that were permanently sequestered through EOR projects or other utilization methods was $60 per ton.

Some of the largest projects carry the biggest potential payouts.

For the Ascension Clean Energy Facility in Ascension Parish, a projected capacity to capture 12 million tons annually could generate over $1 billion per year in tax credits.

For the Air Products Darrow Blue Energy Facility in Ascension Parish and the St. Rose Blue Ammonia Facility in St. Charles Parish, each could receive about $425 million annually.

G2 Net-Zero Energy Complex in Cameron Parish would be eligible for roughly $340 million per year.

Several other ammonia, methanol, and LNG facilities – including Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex, Cameron LNG Facility, and CF Industries/Mitsui Gulf Coast Blue Ammonia Plant – would qualify for between $85 million and $170 million annually.

Several other ventures, such as Commonwealth LNG, Big Lake Fuels, and Methanex Geismar Methanol, have not disclosed projected capture volumes, meaning the ultimate credit tally could climb even higher, according to the Project.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/10/4.-Depositphotos_cash-money.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:08:11.607286

Crypto mining companies are actively negotiating contracts with Brazilian electricity providers, such as Renova Energia, that would benefit from the South American country's surplus renewable power without burdening the grid during peak times. A report from Reuters details the negotiations.

Following crypto heavyweight Tether, which announced in July an investment in the South American country, there are at least six negotiations for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as one for a larger project of up to 400 megawatts (MW), people from six different companies told Reuters.

Mining machines that solve complex mathematical problems to back crypto transactions have overloaded grids in multiple countries. However, in Brazil, where crypto mining hardly exists today, they could help address a chronic clean electricity oversupply problem, which has cost energy companies almost $1 billion in the last two years, according to wind and solar industry groups ABEEolica and Absolar.

Tether, the world's largest digital assets company, said it is leveraging its recent acquisition of Adecoagro to tap its renewable energy, such as the electricity coming from sugarcane mills, to power a bitcoin mining operation in Brazil.

Renewable energy supplier Renova told Reuters it is making one of the first major investments in the crypto sector, a $200 million mining project for an undisclosed client in the state of Bahia in the northeast of Brazil. The 100-MW venture consists of six data centers that will draw power from a wind farm.

""We aim to expand the company and enter new markets,"" Renova CEO Sergio Brasil said. ""We realized that by providing all the infrastructure (for crypto mining), we were one step ahead of our competitors.""

Crypto miners can rapidly scale operations up or down based on energy availability, providing a flexible consumer base for excess energy without straining the grid during peak demand periods.

Brazil's energy oversupply stems from years of government incentives that spurred a boom in wind and solar investments. But the pace of development has outstripped the expansion of transmission infrastructure, and some plants now waste as much as 70% of the power they generate.

""There's tons of potential,"" John Blount, one of the founders of Enegix, a crypto miner based in Kazakhstan, told Reuters.

Held under the theme “Unlocking a Clean Energy Economy,” the week-long event from October 2 brings together stakeholders to discuss policy solutions and foster partnerships.

It focuses on critical issues in the country’s clean energy transition, such as developing clean energy skills and advancing women’s economic empowerment through a just energy transition.

Hem Vanndy, Minister of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, applauded the summit for bringing stakeholders together in a way that goes beyond dialogue to drive practical action and measurable impact.

“The summit’s theme sends a strong message, emphasizing that clean energy goals are not only about protecting the environment but represent a strategic pathway to safeguard our economy and secure Cambodia’s position in the global market,” Vanndy said.

“Clean energy is no longer just an option, it is a necessity. It holds the key to shaping our next chapter of growth, one defined not by how much we produce, but by how wisely and sustainably we create and use our resources.”

Australian Ambassador Derek Yip commended Cambodia’s progress in expanding access to electricity and exploring renewable energy options.

He noted that the country’s ambitious target of 70 percent renewable energy by 2030 provides a roadmap for building a sustainable and resilient economy.

“Through effective clean energy policies, Cambodia can bolster its growth by enhancing energy reliability, reducing costs, and drawing in responsible investments. These efforts will not only help tackle climate change but also provide access to international markets that are becoming more climate-conscious,” Yip said.

Natharoun Ngo Son, regional director for Energy & Economy at EnergyLab Asia, also praised Cambodia, not only as a major producer of renewable energy for local use but also for its clean energy target.

He is optimistic that a clean energy economy can deliver more jobs, more revenue, enhanced competitiveness and market access, while attracting quality foreign direct investments.

The summit is organized by EnergyLab Cambodia, in partnership with the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and in collaboration with co-founders, Australia and the United Nations Development Programme.

It aims to foster deep collaboration between development partners, government policymakers and the private sector while raising awareness of clean energy among a wider local audience.

The event will show how clean energy strengthens key industries, including garment production and tourism, while attracting investment in energy-intensive and clean technology sectors.

Achieving the clean energy transition

Acknowledging the importance of human resources, Vanndy said the country must invest in people as much as in technology. Engineers, technicians and energy managers were the backbone of the clean energy transition.

“We must also empower them with our collective commitment and contribution to research and development that will open new frontiers and possibilities. Additionally, we need strong public–private partnerships in which every stakeholder coordinates and plays a crucial role in the ecosystem.”

Enrico Gaveglia, UNDP Resident Representative, noted that Cambodia has abundant solar resources, a young workforce and robust regional networks.

He expressed optimism that the country can leapfrog into a clean energy future with the right policies and investments, while pledging UNDP’s support for the journey.

Recognizing Cambodia’s vision of graduating from Least Developed Country status by 2029, Gaveglia said the key challenge is sustaining progress while building resilience in a changing global economy.

He said energy lies at the heart of this challenge. While it drives emissions, it also holds the key to resilience, affordability, and energy security.

However, without universal access to clean, efficient, affordable and inclusive energy, he said Cambodia cannot achieve its development goals.

“Therefore, this national urgency echoes a global call. The UN Secretary-General reminds us that we must triple renewable capacity, double energy efficiency, and achieve universal access to clean energy by 2030,” Gaveglia said.

At the same time, Son advised that, since Cambodia is still in the early stages of unlocking its clean energy economy, it should prioritize three pillars to maximize its potential.

“The first pillar focuses on the nation’s electricity system transition to clean energy, including all the investments into efficient generation, transmission, and distribution technology, to make the transition safe and secure,” Son said.

“The second pillar leverages this clean energy system to accelerate the growth of existing industries and support the emergence of new ones. Cambodia can help investors meet international market requirements for low or zero-carbon products, using clean energy as a key market differentiator.”

He added that Cambodia could benefit by carving out a share of the rapidly growing clean energy manufacturing sector, including producing EVs, solar and wind technologies, battery energy storage systems, and other clean energy equipment.",https://img.cambodianess.com/uploads/article/10-2025/1759403109.JPG,N,,2025-10-02 14:03:20.360322

The electric-vehicle giant delivered 497,000 vehicles globally in the quarter ended Sept. 30, marking a 7% increase from the same period a year earlier and a significant rebound from earlier softness in demand. This performance, fueled by a rush of U.S. buyers aiming to secure a $7,500 federal tax credit before its expiration, underscores how policy shifts can dramatically influence market dynamics in the competitive EV sector.

Analysts had anticipated deliveries around 441,000 to 475,000 units, but the actual figure shattered those projections, driven largely by accelerated purchases in the U.S. market. Tesla’s production also ramped up to 495,000 vehicles, with strong contributions from its factories in the U.S. and China, even as European sales faced headwinds from economic slowdowns and increased competition from local manufacturers.

Tax Credit Expiration Drives Unprecedented Demand Surge

The impending end of the Inflation Reduction Act’s EV tax credit on Sept. 30 appears to have created a buying frenzy, with consumers pulling forward purchases to qualify for the incentive. According to a report from Yahoo Finance, this policy deadline “juiced sales,” leading to what the publication described as “blowout” results. Tesla’s U.S. deliveries hit record levels, offsetting weaker performance in regions like Europe, where regulatory changes and subsidy reductions have dampened enthusiasm for battery-powered cars.

Industry observers note that while the tax credit’s lapse provided a short-term boost, it may lead to a demand hangover in the fourth quarter. Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, from users like market analysts echoed this sentiment, with one highlighting estimates surging to 475,000 units ahead of the deadline due to “strong U.S. demand ahead of the IRA tax credit phase-out.” Such social media buzz reflected growing optimism among investors, contributing to a rebound in Tesla’s stock price in recent weeks.

Production Ramp-Up and Global Market Challenges

Tesla’s ability to scale production amid this demand spike demonstrates its operational agility, with energy storage deployments also reaching 12.5 gigawatt-hours in the quarter—a metric that points to expanding revenue streams beyond vehicles. However, the company faces ongoing challenges, including intensified competition from rivals like BYD Co. in China and legacy automakers ramping up their EV offerings in the U.S.

A piece from CNBC emphasized that the tax credit’s expiration “got a boost as some consumers rush to buy electric vehicles,” aligning with Tesla’s strategy of offering incentives like discounted leases to maintain momentum. Yet, as noted in reports from Reuters, Tesla has already hiked lease prices post-expiration, signaling potential pricing power but also risks of alienating price-sensitive buyers in a post-subsidy environment.

Investor Reactions and Future Implications

Wall Street reacted positively to the delivery beat, with Tesla shares climbing in after-hours trading, validating earlier predictions from firms like UBS, which had raised forecasts citing the tax credit’s impact. This quarterly win comes at a pivotal time for Tesla, as it navigates broader industry headwinds such as supply-chain constraints and fluctuating raw material costs for batteries.

Looking ahead, analysts from Business Insider warn that the pull-forward effect could result in softer Q4 numbers, potentially missing the company’s ambitious 2 million annual delivery goal for 2025—with year-to-date figures at around 1.2 million. X posts from financial commentators, including those tracking stock movements, suggested a “monster Q3” driven by the credit’s end and new model launches in China, but cautioned about a possible demand dip. For Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this quarter reinforces the company’s resilience, yet it also highlights the vulnerability of EV adoption to policy whims, prompting questions about sustainable growth without incentives.

Strategic Shifts in a Post-Credit Era

In response to the tax credit’s demise, Tesla is pivoting toward cost efficiencies and new product unveilings, such as rumored updates to its Model Y and Cybertruck lines, to sustain buyer interest. The company’s focus on autonomous driving technology and robotaxi ambitions could diversify its appeal, but regulatory hurdles in key markets remain a concern.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-c32fa7f0-741e-4c9a-bcd0-233328a65144.jpeg,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:19.012958

The Desert Southwest pipeline expansion will enhance the reliability of the Transwestern pipeline system, ensuring a steady supply of natural gas to power plants serving both residential and industrial customers.
Economic and Strategic Benefits Beyond energy reliability, the Desert Southwest pipeline expansion is a catalyst for economic growth.
A Step Toward a Resilient Energy Future The Desert Southwest pipeline expansion is a strategic investment in the Southwest’s energy and economic future.","Energy Transfer recently announced an important step forward in addressing the surging energy demands of the Southwestern United States with the final investment decision (FID) for its Desert Southwest pipeline expansion project. This 516-mile, 42-inch pipeline, an extension of the existing Transwestern pipeline, will transport 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas from the Permian Basin to growing markets in Arizona and New Mexico.

The Permian region, one of the top-producing shale basins in the world, accounts for nearly half of all U.S. oil production. Additionally, in 2024, the Permian region contributed 22% of U.S. marketed natural gas production and drove nearly all of the increase in U.S. output. Production increased by 12% (2.7 Bcfd) to 25.4 Bcfd, primarily due to associated gas from oil production. However, due to years of policy-driven underinvestment in energy infrastructure, pipelines are near capacity in the Permian Basin.

This project, with an estimated cost of $5.3 billion, including $600 million for Allowance for Funds Used During Construction, and backed by long-term commitments from investment-grade customers, is a critical investment in energy infrastructure that promises to enhance reliability, support economic growth, and meet the needs of a rapidly growing region. Scheduled for completion in Q4 2029, the Desert Southwest expansion is a forward-thinking solution to energy demand growth in the Southwest, particularly in Arizona, where the data center boom is driving unprecedented demand.

Meeting the Energy Demands of a Data-Driven Future

Arizona is emerging as a global hub for data centers, with over 129 facilities already operating in the state. The data center sector is a cornerstone of the digital economy, powering everything from cloud computing to artificial intelligence, and these facilities are energy-intensive. According to Data Center Dynamics, Arizona’s major utilities, Arizona Public Service (APS) and Salt River Project (SRP), are stepping up to meet this challenge by securing natural gas capacity from the Desert Southwest pipeline.

APS, the project’s anchor customer, has committed to spending up to $7.3 billion over 25 years to purchase gas from the expansion to fuel new gas-fired power plants. These plants, set to come online in 2029 alongside the pipeline, will directly support data centers within APS’s service territory, which spans 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties and serves 1.4 million customers. APS currently faces nearly 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of committed demand, primarily from data centers, with an additional 20GW of uncommitted large-load customers in its interconnection queue. This staggering demand underscores the urgency of reliable, scalable energy solutions like the Desert Southwest pipeline.

Safely Enhancing Energy Reliability in a Growing State

Arizona’s energy mix is heavily reliant on natural gas, which accounts for 45% of the state’s electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nuclear power contributes 27%, solar 13%, and coal 8%. As the state faces limitations in scaling renewable energy to meet round-the-clock demand, natural gas will remain an important energy source going forward. The Desert Southwest pipeline expansion will enhance the reliability of the Transwestern pipeline system, ensuring a steady supply of natural gas to power plants serving both residential and industrial customers.

The agreements between Energy Transfer, APS, and SRP provide priority delivery of natural gas, offering a stable and predictable energy source for Arizona’s utilities. This is particularly vital for data centers, which require uninterrupted power to operate effectively. By extending the Transwestern pipeline’s reach, the project adds optionality and resilience to the region’s energy infrastructure, mitigating risks of supply disruptions and supporting Arizona’s reputation as a reliable destination for tech investment.

Pipelines are critical to modern life, delivering the energy and resources that power homes, businesses, and industries. Most importantly, they do so with an impressive safety record, thanks to advanced engineering, real-time monitoring, and strict oversight. The National Pipeline Performance Measures Report, published by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), provides annual summaries of pipeline safety data for gas transmission, hazardous liquids, and gas distribution systems across the country. Over the past 20 years (2005–2024), PHMSA data show a 40% decline in significant pipeline incidents, defined as those involving fatalities, injuries requiring hospitalization, costs exceeding $50,000, liquid releases of five barrels (highly volatile) or 50 barrels (other liquids), or unintentional fires/explosions. This strong safety record underscores the reliability of projects like the Desert Southwest expansion, ensuring a steady and secure natural gas supply to meet Arizona’s growing energy demands.

Economic and Strategic Benefits

Beyond energy reliability, the Desert Southwest pipeline expansion is a catalyst for economic growth. By enabling utilities to meet the needs of high-growth sectors like data centers, the pipeline supports Arizona’s position as a leader in the tech industry. The state’s favorable business climate, combined with reliable energy infrastructure, makes it an attractive destination for investors looking to support projects with intensive energy demands.

Moreover, the project’s long-term commitments from investment-grade customers signal strong market confidence in its viability. These commitments reduce financial risk and ensure the pipeline’s capacity will be fully utilized, maximizing its economic impact. The expansion also aligns with broader energy trends, as natural gas continues to play a pivotal role in balancing affordability and reliability.

A Step Toward a Resilient Energy Future

The Desert Southwest pipeline expansion is a strategic investment in the Southwest’s energy and economic future. By connecting the Permian Basin’s abundant natural gas resources to Arizona’s and New Mexico’s growing markets, the project is addressing the immediate needs of utilities like APS and SRP while laying the groundwork for long-term growth. The project’s focus on reliability, supported by significant financial commitments and a clear timeline for completion, makes it a cornerstone of Arizona’s emergence as a tech powerhouse.

As data centers continue to drive demand and Arizona solidifies its role as a regional tech hub, the Desert Southwest pipeline expansion stands out as a pragmatic and forward-thinking solution. It ensures that the region’s energy infrastructure can keep pace with its economic ambitions, delivering reliable power to millions of customers and supporting the industries that will shape the future.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bigstock-Gas-And-Oil-Pipeline-Construct-437286161.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 14:03:26.290993

Consumers’ Research campaign warns Chubb Insurance is pushing a political agenda

Consumers’ Research

Consumers’ Research has launched a multimillion-dollar campaign targeting insurance giant Chubb, accusing it of prioritizing political and social agendas over its customers. The campaign includes national TV ads, billboards, and digital outreach in Washington, D.C., New York City, and New Jersey, highlighting Chubb’s support for climate policies, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and what critics call “radical gender ideology.” Executive Director Will Hild charged Chubb with undermining women’s protections, attacking democratic laws, and hurting America’s energy industry by restricting coal and natural gas coverage. The campaign seeks to hold Chubb accountable for advancing what it calls “radical woke ideology.” [MDN: It’s about time our side started outing sleazy organizations like Chubb.

U.S. government shutdown leaves energy markets on edge

OilPrice.com/Charles Kennedy

The U.S. government shutdown has significant consequences for energy markets, removing critical data and delaying regulatory processes. The Energy Information Administration’s weekly petroleum and natural gas reports, vital for price discovery and risk management, will halt, forcing traders to rely on less reliable private surveys, increasing volatility. Suspension of economic data from agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics leaves markets and the Federal Reserve without employment and inflation signals, complicating demand forecasts. Financing costs rise as Treasury yields climb, while project permitting slows at agencies like FERC and BOEM. Globally, OPEC+ and refiners lose visibility, heightening uncertainty and price swings. [MDN: This “uncertainty” in the energy markets is a small price to pay for refusing to be blackmailed by the Democrats into spending another trillion dollars on insider pork that they demand.

Oil prices fell for a third straight day as concerns over oversupply and weakening demand pressured markets. West Texas Intermediate dropped nearly 1% to $61.78 a barrel, while Brent fell to $65.35. Traders speculated OPEC+ might accelerate output hikes despite the group denying such plans, adding to bearish sentiment. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.79 million barrels, with gasoline demand hitting a six-month low, further weighing on futures. Analysts warned of a record surplus next year, citing bearish supply-demand balances, while Middle Eastern crude benchmarks also slipped amid expectations of increased regional supply, amplifying market pessimism.

The shutdown prohibits the EPA from obligating funds for new grants and cooperative agreements, unless they are tied to excepted activities.
Existing agreements may continue, but any new support for farmers is likely to be halted, according to the EPA plan.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- With agriculture waiting for final Renewable Fuel Standard volumes and other RFS rules, as well as a pending waters of the U.S. rule, the federal government shutdown that began on Wednesday has cast a shadow on when exactly that work could be completed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Even if the shutdown period is relatively short, a significant reduction in agency employees could further slow rulemaking.

According to an EPA shutdown plan, before the shutdown, the agency had 15,166 employees, and once the shutdown plan is implemented, just 1,734 employees are expected to be retained to execute ""excepted"" or ""exempted"" activities needed during the shutdown.

The plan states that by default, any employee not designated as excepted or exempted will be furloughed during the shutdown. The document also notes that the agency retains the authority to modify the number of personnel working during the shutdown. As of Wednesday morning, the Trump administration had not announced plans to permanently lay off EPA employees when the shutdown ends.

Right now, the shutdown will continue to at least Friday, when the U.S. Senate is next scheduled to vote on ending it.

The EPA's plan provides guidance on defining ""exempted activities"" that would continue during the government shutdown.

That includes those that are funded with ""unexpired appropriations"" where carryover funds remain unobligated.

Exempted activities also include those funded with appropriations that are not subject to the annual appropriations process, such as permanent indefinite appropriations.

For example, on Wednesday, the EPA held a virtual public hearing on the RFS volumes proposal, https://www.dtnpf.com/…, just hours after the shutdown became official.

EXEMPTED EPA ACTIVITIES

Examples of exempted activities include those funded by permanent appropriations like those under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) or the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).

The key criterion is that EPA activities must have funding sources other than the annual appropriations that have lapsed to be considered exempted and allowed to continue during a shutdown.

Based on EPA's plan, here are some key things to consider:

-- Permit approvals: The plan said that issuing new permits, guidance, regulations and policies will generally cease during a shutdown, unless necessary for excepted or exempted activities. This could delay or halt the approval of Clean Water Act permits that farmers may be waiting on.

-- Renewable Fuel Standard, waters of the U.S. rule: The plan indicates rulemaking activities, like finalizing volumes, would likely cease during the shutdown unless they are deemed necessary for excepted activities. That would include the RFS and WOTUS. A further delay on the RFS volumes is likely to make agriculture and biofuels interests pull their hair, as those volumes are already extremely late.

-- Ag chemicals: Based on the EPA plan, the approval of agriculture chemicals like pesticides and herbicides would likely be affected during the shutdown.

FUNDING DISTINCTIONS

EPA said that activities funded by permanent appropriations, such as those under FIFRA, may be considered ""exempted activities"" and allowed to continue. This would include the EPA's pesticide registration and review processes funded through FIFRA fees.

However, the issuance of new permits, guidance, regulations and policies generally ceases during a shutdown, unless they are deemed necessary for excepted or exempted activities. This could delay or halt the EPA's approval of new or amended pesticide and herbicide registrations.

When it comes to existing pesticide and herbicide registrations, EPA said in the plan that work could continue if it does not require interaction with non-exempted EPA employees. This would allow some registration maintenance activities to continue.

As is the case with many EPA functions, with most EPA staff furloughed, the agency's overall capacity to review, process and approve new agriculture chemical registrations is significantly reduced during a shutdown.

-- Enforcement and compliance: EPA's plan says civil-enforcement inspections would generally cease, unless necessary for excepted or exempted activities.

-- State program approvals: The plan indicates that approvals of pending state requests, such as authorized/delegated state-issued EPA permits, will likely cease during the shutdown, unless necessary for excepted or exempted activities. This could affect state-level water quality programs that farmers interact with.

An extended shutdown will likely cause delays and disruptions to a variety of EPA activities and approvals that farmers depend on, unless those activities are deemed excepted or exempted from the shutdown.

Perhaps one of the biggest effects of the shutdown is on the approval and permitting process.

Farmers who need Clean Water Act permits to conduct work on their land are facing uncertainty, as the EPA plan indicates that issuing new permits will generally cease during the shutdown, unless deemed essential.

Farmers who count on federal grants and financial assistance programs are also facing challenges.

The shutdown prohibits the EPA from obligating funds for new grants and cooperative agreements, unless they are tied to excepted activities. Existing agreements may continue, but any new support for farmers is likely to be halted, according to the EPA plan.

The first government shutdown in nearly seven years left federal agencies in flux and many of their employees in a state of confusion on Wednesday, as they received last-minute and conflicting instructions from managers.

Even though the likelihood of a shutdown has been high for months, agencies were late to post their contingency plans compared with previous years, leaving employees and the public in the dark about what to expect. And internal guidance to work forces in some cases was not consistent with the official plans. Some employees who expected to be furloughed learned on Wednesday that they had to report to work.

But despite the uncertainty inside the government, the initial ripple effects across the country were scattered and limited.

There was no major disruption to air travel. The Internal Revenue Service answered calls from taxpayers. And federal agents arrested immigrants who showed up for routine court appearances in Lower Manhattan.

But the impact was felt elsewhere. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta was closed, and visitors got a quick civic lesson: Presidential libraries are operated by the federal National Archives and Records Administration, which furloughed more than half of its staff.

“We thought it was privately funded, or we would have come yesterday,” said Cindy Mobley, 64, of Baltimore. Ms. Mobley and her husband were in town visiting their son, a freshman at nearby Emory University.

Not being able to visit the museum, Ms. Mobley said, “is a small price to pay if it leads to something better for all of our citizens.” She said she supported congressional Democrats who are refusing to agree to a spending plan that does not restore funding for Medicaid and extend health insurance subsidies.

For Chris Hill, of New York, the first day of the shutdown brought an unprompted message from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He said he had been working with the agency to resolve a benefits issue regarding his late father and was surprised to see the message informing him that the government was shut down, noting that some agency services would not be available.

The message also blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which Mr. Hill said also caught him by surprise.

“It was such a political and one-sided message sent out by a department that is supposed to deal equally with veterans, regardless of their political opinions,” he said in an interview.

Similar political responses have come from other agencies, marking what many believe to be the first time an administration has used the bureaucracy to deliver blatantly partisan messaging during a shutdown.

Legal experts say doing so violates a federal law, the Hatch Act, designed to ensure that the federal work force operates free of political influence or coercion. And many federal workers expressed discomfort about being drawn into the political morass.

And for at least the first week of the shutdown, the 74,299 employees at the Internal Revenue Service are working as though nothing has changed. The agency is able to do this because of a special pot of money created by Democrats in 2022 intended to fund operations when appropriated funds have run out.

The tax agency lost 25,000 employees this year under the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the government. It is racing to prepare for next year’s filing season, when many Americans could feel the effects of new tax cuts passed by Republicans this summer.

It is not clear how many people at the tax agency will continue working once the special fund is depleted. But until then, if people call the agency with a question about the upcoming extended filing deadline on Oct. 15, for example, they should be able to receive a response as if the rest of the government were not shut down.

But not all agencies were as clear and transparent as the I.R.S. when it came to telling employees what to expect on Wednesday.

Some employees at the Environmental Protection Agency were surprised late on Tuesday to learn that they would not be furloughed, as expected. The agency’s shutdown plan called for just 11 percent of the staff to continue working. Instead, the employees were told they would continue to work on activities that have yet to run out of funding.

Typically, when operations are able to continue during a government shutdown because of leftover funds, that is noted in an agency’s contingency plan. This was not the case for the E.P.A.’s plan, though, and employees wondered whether they would be working without pay.

“Continue to work on initiatives as directed by your leadership,” the head of the agency’s air office, Aaron Szabo, said in a Wednesday memo to his staff, which was reviewed by The New York Times. He advised that employees would be “notified if there is any change in status.”

Employees from some agencies noted other inconsistencies and problems, including how little notice they received about plans ahead of the shutdown.

A National Park Service employee said messaging was chaotic and changing well into Wednesday afternoon. Some employees were told that they were furloughed but that their status could change at any time.

The Statue of Liberty, which is operated by the National Park Service, was open on Wednesday, but funding was expected to run out in the coming days.

The Justice Department asked judges across the country to pause many civil cases because the department did not have the staff to handle them during the shutdown. While this is a routine outcome during a funding lapse, if the shutdown goes on for weeks it could have a real impact on cases that judges have agreed to postpone, including those challenging Trump administration policies that have been moving through the court system.

Organizations that sued the administration over funding cuts may be forced to change course and try to settle cases, said David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University.

Other federal programs that the public relies on will also run out of funding if the government shutdown stretches into days or weeks, including federally funded child care and federal grocery vouchers for low-income mothers and children.

If the shutdown drags on, the Food and Drug Administration may have to stop some routine inspections of food and medication facilities.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency said in a statement.

A list of impacted projects was not immediately available. DOE said award recipients have 30 days to appeal a termination decision and “some of the projects included in this announcement have already begun that process.”

In total, DOE said it terminated 321 financial awards issued by the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and Fossil Energy.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said DOE has been working to review “billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

Of the financial awards terminated, DOE said 26% were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day. “Those awards alone were valued at over $3.1 billion,” the agency said.

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a post on X that the terminated projects were in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” Vought wrote.

Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates said DOE’s funding cancellation is illegal, and an example of a presidential administration executing a political vendetta that will hurt all Americans.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

“Our democracy is badly broken when a president can illegally suspend projects for Blue states in order to punish his political enemies,” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a social media post.

“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs. It is reckless and betrays both common sense and public trust,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said in a statement.

Cutting the projects’ funding “will mean lost factory jobs and higher energy prices for American consumers,” Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “Ending support for these projects will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Canceled funding awards reportedly include hydrogen projects in California and the Pacific Northwest. NRDC said the cancellations also include funding for battery plants, electric grid upgrades, clean vehicle manufacturing and industrial demonstrations projects.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statement confirming DOE canceled up to $1.2 billion for the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, the state’s planned hydrogen hub.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

Ultimately, U.S. consumers will pay the price, advocates said.

The department's announcement came hours after White House budget director Russell Vought said in a post on X that the administration would terminate nearly $8 billion in climate-related funding in 16 Democratic-led states, including California and New York.

The move was part of a broader, $26 billion funding freeze that was unveiled on Wednesday as President Donald Trump followed through on a threat to use the federal government shutdown to target Democratic priorities.

In a statement issued late on Wednesday, the DOE said it would cancel 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects. It did not list the projects, but said the grants had been issued by six agency offices responsible for clean energy, efficiency, grid deployment, advanced research, manufacturing and fossil fuels.

The Colorado Energy Office announced Thursday morning that the state rebate for new EV purchases will increase to $9,000 from $6,000, and the rebate for used EV purchases will increase to $6,000 from $4,000.
The rebate program is paid for by the state’s Community Access Enterprise, which is funded through fees charged to rideshare companies and retail delivery services such as DoorDash.
The increased rebate amounts reflect Colorado policymakers’ belief that electric vehicles are the automobile of the future, Toor said.
“Colorado has emerged as the top electric vehicle market in the country as far as market share.","Colorado is increasing the amount of money offered through the state’s electric vehicle rebate program in November as a response to President Donald Trump’s elimination of federal tax credits for the same purchases.

The Colorado Energy Office announced Thursday morning that the state rebate for new EV purchases will increase to $9,000 from $6,000, and the rebate for used EV purchases will increase to $6,000 from $4,000.

The increased rebates begin Nov. 3, one month after the federal tax credit for purchases ended on Sept. 30 as part of Trump’s plan to push fossil fuels in the United States despite their contribution to climate change.

“The change that we’re making right now is really in response to the fact that the Trump administration has effectively just increased taxes on people by removing the tax credits for electric vehicles and made it harder for folks to afford EVs,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “We are responding by increasing the incentives that are available.”

Colorado’s rebate remains dependent on a household’s income. A buyer must make less than 80% of the area median income in whichever county they live.

For example, a Denver household of four people must have an income of $112,080 or less, according to the energy office’s income qualification chart. A single person in Denver would need to earn $78,480 or less.

Those who receive the rebate must exchange an older, high-emissions vehicle. The rebate is given at the time of the new car purchase, so buyers do not have to wait until they file income taxes to benefit. People can apply online at coloradoenergyoffice.aptim.com.

The rebate program is paid for by the state’s Community Access Enterprise, which is funded through fees charged to rideshare companies and retail delivery services such as DoorDash.

Colorado’s budget crunch, which is requiring legislators to trim $1 billion from the state’s general fund, does not impact the program, Toor said. The enterprise fund money is dedicated to increasing the use of electric cars, trucks and bicycles in the state.

Funding for the increased incentives will come from the Vehicle Exchange Colorado program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, and the ongoing funding for the exchange program is expected through June 30, 2032.

The state started its Vehicle Exchange Colorado program in 2023 and has issued rebates toward 2,743 car purchases, said Ed Piersa, senior program manager at the energy office.

The increased rebate amounts reflect Colorado policymakers’ belief that electric vehicles are the automobile of the future, Toor said.

Electric vehicles have proven to be a popular option for Colorado’s drivers.

More than 200,000 electric vehicles are registered in Colorado, and the cars and trucks have accounted for more than a quarter of all new vehicle sales in the state in 2025, the energy office reported.

Encouraging more people to drive them improves Colorado’s air quality and helps the state reach its climate goals of eliminating almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. For drivers, the vehicles have lower fuel and maintenance costs than gas-powered vehicles, Toor said.

“We think it’s really important to continue the momentum on EVs here,” Toor said. “Colorado has emerged as the top electric vehicle market in the country as far as market share. We want to maintain that momentum even as the federal government goes in the other direction.”",https://www.timescall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-VOLKSWAGEN-EV_DSC9719x.jpg?w=1024&h=692,N,,2025-10-02 12:05:43.991267

Congress had authorized roughly $8 billion for so-called hydrogen hubs as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law of 2021.
None of the hubs in Republican-controlled states such as West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana were affected by the latest round of cancellations.","The Energy Department said on Wednesday night that it was terminating more than $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for hundreds of energy projects, with the vast majority located in states led by Democrats.

The move underscored how the Trump administration appeared to be using the government shutdown to punish its political opponents. President Trump said this week that if Democrats in Congress did not vote for a funding bill to keep the government open, he could “do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them.”

In its Wednesday announcement, the Energy Department did not specify which projects were being cut. But according to an agency document reviewed by The New York Times, the list of canceled projects includes major upgrades to electrical grids in California and Minnesota, as well as large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels in California and the Pacific Northwest.

In a news release, the Energy Department said it had determined that the projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The move met swift condemnation from Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, where one of the largest canceled projects had been projected to create more than 220,000 jobs. “In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement. “We’ll continue to pursue an all-of-the-above clean-energy strategy that powers our future and cleans the air, no matter what D.C. tries to dictate.”

Before the Energy Department announced the cancellations, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, suggested in social media posts that they were imminent. “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” he wrote on X.

Mr. Vought did not provide details, and the Energy Department did not issue the news release until several hours later. In the meantime, many state officials, members of Congress and energy executives were scrambling on Wednesday to figure out which projects would be affected.

Two of the largest canceled awards would have gone toward projects in California and the Pacific Northwest that focused on the production, transportation and storage of clean hydrogen, which has the potential to produce steel and fertilizer, or to power trucks, without producing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Congress had authorized roughly $8 billion for so-called hydrogen hubs as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law of 2021. The Biden administration had awarded roughly $1 billion apiece to seven such hubs across the country.

None of the hubs in Republican-controlled states such as West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana were affected by the latest round of cancellations.

Greg Keoleian, a professor at the University of Michigan whose research focuses on hydrogen, said the canceled projects would have helped the United States compete with China and Europe, which have more mature hydrogen industries. “We need to be investing in clean energy technologies like hydrogen for global competitiveness,” Dr. Keoleian said.

Also targeted for cancellation was a $464 million grant awarded to Minnesota to help improve the connections between two large regional electrical grids in the Midwest and Great Plains. That project was aimed at making it easier to add more renewable energy to the grid and reducing the risk of blackouts. Proponents said it would have helped reduce electricity costs across a wide region, including in Republican-led states.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/multimedia/02cli-clean-energy-cuts-fjkz/02cli-clean-energy-cuts-fjkz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:06:38.458153

The city is actively seeking public comment on the draft to ensure the final plan reflects community priorities and needs.

“Louisville continues to innovate, set ambitious goals, and lead with purpose,” said Mayor Greenberg. “This plan is about building a city that works better for everyone. A city where clean air, smart infrastructure, and economic opportunity go hand in hand. We’ve had meaningful conversations with the public and we invite everyone to stay involved and help guide the next steps.”

Louisville hired AECOM and EHI Consultants in November of 2024 to help create a two-part EV Readiness Plan. The draft of the community plan outlines recommendations and strategies to expand public EV infrastructure and remove barriers to EV adoption. A forthcoming component of the plan outlines steps needed to transition the city’s fleet to zero-emission vehicles. Together, both components support the city’s sustainability goals of achieving 100% clean energy for Metro Government operations by 2035 and 100% community-wide by 2040.

What’s in the Plan:

Current EV Trends & Future Demand: EV ownership in Jefferson County tripled between 2021 and 2024, signaling the need for a major scale-up in public charging infrastructure to meet projected growth through 2040.

Community Voices and Ideas: Insights from surveys, focus groups, and stakeholder engagement shaped the plan’s priorities, identifying barriers such as cost, EV range concerns, and lack of home charging access.

Infrastructure Gaps & Priority Areas: The plan pinpoints areas most in need of charging stations, including multifamily housing, employment hubs, shopping destinations, and historically underserved neighborhoods.

Implementation Strategies: Outlines actions guiding a citywide EV transition, including public-private deployment models, workforce training, permitting reform, and funding pathways.

“We’ve heard from residents, community organizations, and key stakeholders across Louisville,” said Katie Littman, Deputy Director for the Cabinet of Economic Development. “They told us where charging is needed, the barriers that stand in the way, and how we can make this transition work for everyone in our city.”

The Cabinet for Economic Development assembled a steering committee of internal agencies to lead this process, including the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Facilities and Fleet. The Department of Transportation will lead implementation moving forward.

The release of the draft plan follows a major announcement from Ford Motor Company. In August, Ford announced it will invest $2 billion to retool Louisville’s Assembly Plant for electric vehicle production. The investment secured 2,200 local jobs and put Louisville firmly at the forefront of Ford’s EV rollout.

Residents, businesses, and organizations are encouraged to review the plan and share feedback. The public comment period is now open and will run through Friday, October 31. Click here to view the EV Readiness Plan.

For our future energy transition to be successful, it must work for everyone.
In port cities, a rising tide must lift all boats.
Investing in ports as clean energy hubs isn’t just a choice, it’s a necessity.","It is time to chart a new course for our port cities. For more than 200 years, fossil fuels have been at the heart of the global shipping industry, from coal in the 19th century to oil in the 20th. The 21st century must be a time of change. Rapid technological advances and the urgent need to address the climate crisis have created a generational opportunity: By transforming into clean energy hubs, port cities can unlock billions in investment, create new green jobs, and deliver cleaner air.

The world’s desire for trade shows no signs of abating, and with 80% of traded goods transported by sea, the shipping industry will continue to grow. The worldwide fleet reached a record size in 2024, and shipping is currently on track to increase its share of global carbon dioxide emissions to 17% by 2050.

Future-proofing ports

The transformation underway — as set out in a new report from C40 Cities and global built environment consultancy Arup — presents a strategic lever for cities and industry to enhance urban prosperity and resilience.

By leveraging three key investment opportunities, ports have the chance to become engines of 21st-century green growth. Fortunately, this work is already underway in ports across continents:

1. Sustainable fuel hubs

Ports can become global leaders in the production and export of cleaner fuels, such as green ammonia and green methanol. This isn’t just about a healthier planet; it’s about creating entirely new industries and jobs.

Durban, home to South Africa’s busiest container port, is part of a wider Hydrogen Valley opportunity across the country, which could create thousands of jobs, de-risk investments in hydrogen fuel cells, and position South Africa as a key energy exporter internationally.

On the other side of the Atlantic, Unigel’s Camaçari project is Brazil’s first large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia facility. Following an initial $120 million injection, the facility is set to reel in $1.5 billion in private finance, scaling production to 100,000 metric tons of green hydrogen by 2027. Investments of this scale could create significant numbers of jobs in e-fuel production, renewable energy generation, and their supply chains.

2. Electrification hubs

By electrifying port operations, from ships at berth to cranes and trucks, cities can dramatically improve public health — reducing dangerous particulate emissions, lowering noise pollution, and increasing the quality of life for port communities.

The Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach have already raised over $115 million through a fee placed on the most polluting trucks to facilitate the shift to cleaner alternatives, with funds dedicated to supporting this transition. Studies in Seattle and New York show that full electrification of harbor operations could slash fine particulate matter levels by up to 75% and 69% respectively. This is about delivering a better quality of life and a healthier future for communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution.

3. Offshore wind hubs

Ports could also serve as vital manufacturing and installation hubs for wind turbines. This enables deployment of large-scale renewables, creates new economic opportunities, and delivers thousands of skilled green jobs in communities that need them most.

The Port of Pecém in the Brazilian state of Ceará is home to two wind blade factories and is now exporting wind components globally, while the Empire Wind 1 development in New York City is set to power 500,000 homes, supported by the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. This is about turning once underused land into productive, clean energy assets that power our cities.

Prosperous ports, empowered people, protected planet

All the examples above — and the many more being developed around the world — have one thing in common: They benefit both people and the planet. For our future energy transition to be successful, it must work for everyone. In port cities, a rising tide must lift all boats.

This is only possible by investing in workforce development — providing training and upskilling opportunities that empower workers to transition from legacy industries to the clean economy. It means involving trade unions, academic institutions, and national governments, avoiding silos, and ensuring an inclusive transition for all.

The path ahead is clear. Investing in ports as clean energy hubs isn’t just a choice, it’s a necessity. It is the most direct way to prove that a thriving economy and a healthy environment are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are profoundly and intimately intertwined. By embracing this crucial opportunity, port cities will drive a just transition that benefits people, the planet, and the global economy for generations to come.","https://res.cloudinary.com/devex/image/fetch/g_south_east,h_127,l_devexLogo_on_orange_xneahv.svg,o_80,w_240/https://neo-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/news/images/110868.jpg",N,,2025-10-02 13:04:52.543372

Tesla reported record-breaking third-quarter vehicle deliveries of 497,099 units on October 2, 2025, substantially exceeding Wall Street expectations of around 447,600 deliveries. The 7% year-over-year increase came as buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of a federal tax credit that ended as part of President Donald Trump’s spending bill passed in July. The strong delivery numbers pushed Tesla shares up over 1% following the announcement, with the company set to report full financial results on October 22, 2025.

Record Q3 Deliveries Fueled by Expiring EV Tax Credits

Tesla’s third-quarter performance marked a significant turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines earlier in 2025. The company delivered 497,099 vehicles during the period ended September 30, up from 462,890 deliveries in the same quarter of 2024. Production totaled 447,450 vehicles for the quarter, with the company manufacturing 435,826 of its popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The surge in deliveries was partially driven by U.S. customers rushing to take advantage of a federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers before it expired at the end of September.

The tax credit expiration was part of President Donald Trump’s spending bill that passed in July 2025. This deadline created urgency among potential EV buyers, particularly offsetting weakness in European markets where Tesla faced declining sales due to consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk’s political activism and increased competition from manufacturers like Volkswagen and BYD. The company’s energy storage business also performed strongly, deploying 12.5 GWh of battery storage products including Megapack and Megablock systems, up significantly from 6.9 GWh in the third quarter of 2024.

Shares Hold Momentum, But Profit Margins Raise Questions

As of 10:06 AM EDT on October 2, 2025, Tesla stock (TSLA) was trading at $458.26, down $1.20 or 0.26% for the day, though shares had climbed over 1% immediately following the delivery report announcement. The stock has demonstrated remarkable momentum recently, jumping 40% during the third quarter and turning positive for the year with a 14% year-to-date gain, compared to the Nasdaq’s 18% rise. Tesla’s market capitalization stood at $1.523 trillion, with the stock trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 261.79 based on earnings per share of $1.75.

Despite the strong delivery numbers, Tesla faces significant headwinds in the fourth quarter and beyond without the federal tax credit incentive. Analyst price targets for the stock range widely from a low of $115 to a high of $600, with an average target of $345.50, suggesting substantial uncertainty about the company’s valuation. The company’s automotive margins have compressed from 23% to 17.2%, raising questions about profitability as Tesla competes with lower-priced competitors like BYD’s $10,000 vehicles. Investors will be closely watching Tesla’s October 22 earnings call for guidance on how the expiration of federal EV incentives will impact demand in future quarters.

Tesla FSD V14: Next Big Catalyst?

Tesla investors and fans will now turn their attention to self-driving. Musk said Sept. 25 on his social site X that Full Self-Driving version 14 will have an ""early wide"" release this week. FSD v14 hasn't arrived yet.

Analyst Hails 'Massive Bounceback' In Deliveries

Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a long-time Tesla bull, hailed a ""great bounceback quarter"" for the EV giant. While acknowledging that Tesla benefited from the now-expired tax credits, he sees reasons to be hopeful about China and even Europe.

But he also said attention remains on Tesla self-driving ambitions, which accounts for the bulk of his street-high 600 price target on TSLA stock.

Rivian Narrows Delivery Guidance

Also early Thursday, Rivian (RIVN) disclosed that it produced 10,720 vehicles in Q3 and delivered 13,201. That was in line with the company's forecast. For the full year, Rivian now expects to deliver 41,500-43,500 vehicles vs. prior guidance for 40,000-46,000. That reduces the midpoint of the guidance to 42,500 from 43,000.

Rivian stock fell solidly at the open.

9:14 a.m. ET

Tesla Deliveries Going Forward?

U.S. buyers who made a firm order before Sept. 30 will still get the $7,500 tax credit when they take delivery in the next several weeks. Still, U.S. demand is expected to plunge in Q4 and remain weak for some time.

Some other automakers have already slashed U.S. EV prices to bolster demand. Tesla also could end up cutting U.S. prices somewhat. Even so a lot of demand has been pulled forward.

Tesla is expected to release a stripped-down, more-affordable Model Y in Q4. But if the price tag is higher than what U.S. consumers paid for a ""real"" Model Y with the tax credit, that won't entice many domestic sales.

A cheaper Model Y might do better in China, though it could cannibalize other Model Y sales.

The China EV industry tends to have its best quarter in Q4. That may be particularly true this year, with tax credits phasing out on Dec. 31. Tesla China sales have been falling in 2025 amid rising overall EV sales, but will likely see at least another quarter-to-quarter gain in Q4.

However, that would set up an even-bigger drop in Tesla sales in Q1 2026.

9:10 a.m. ET

Tesla Stock Rises

Tesla stock rose more than 3% to about 474 following the Q3 deliveries release. Shares had been up slightly, heading into the data, continuing a powerful run toward record highs in recent weeks. TSLA stock is closing in on the late December all-time high of 488.54.

9:08 a.m. ET

Record Energy Storage Deployed

Tesla deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage in Q3 vs. 9.6 GWh in Q2 and 6.9 GWh in Q3 2024.

9:05 a.m. ET

Tesla Deliveries Hit Record

Tesla delivered a record 497,099 vehicles in Q3, up from 384,122 in Q2 and 462,890 in Q3 2024. That topped the prior all-time high of 495,570 in Q4 2024.

That included 481,166 Model 3 and Model Y EVs and 15,933 ""other"" vehicles, which include the Model S, Model X and Cybertruck.

Tesla produced 447,450 EVs in Q3.

8:43 a.m. ET

Tesla Deliveries Likely Around 9 a.m. ET

Tesla doesn't offer a set time, or even a set date, for its quarterly delivery and production releases. But for several quarters the EV giant has done so on the second day of the new quarter, at 9:00 a.m. ET or just after.

8:03 a.m. ET

Tesla Stock Rising Into Deliveries

Tesla stock rose 2% to 468.51 before Thursday's open, after hitting a 2025 peak on Wednesday.

Tesla Deliveries

Tesla will likely release deliveries around 9 a.m. ET. Deliveries are expected to come in at 456,490, according to the analyst consensus forecast compiled by FactSet. That would be up 18.9% vs. Q2's 384,122, but down 1.4% from 462,890 in Q3 2024.

However, many analysts haven't updated targets since late July. More-recent Tesla delivery forecasts have been in the 470,000-495,000 range.

Troy Teslike, an online Tesla forecaster with a strong record, predicts 481,000 deliveries.

Tesla deliveries hit a record 495,570 in Q4 2024.

Tesla's China and European registrations ran below year-earlier levels, though Chinese sales were up substantially vs. Q2.

The big driver for Q3 deliveries was the Sept. 30 expiration of the $7,500 U.S. tax credit, pulling forward demand. Buyers can take delivery later and still get the EV tax credit as long as they make a firm order by Sept. 30 with at least a nominal payment.

Still, U.S. Tesla demand will likely plunge in Q4 and remain weak for some time. CEO Elon Musk said on the Q2 earnings call that Tesla faces a few ""rough"" quarters following the end of U.S. tax credits.

So, whether Tesla deliveries are strong or weak may not be that meaningful for future EV business.

Tesla Energy Storage

In addition to EV delivery and production figures, Tesla will report energy storage deployed in Q3. Tesla Energy has been a bright spot in the company's current business. In Q2, Tesla deployed 9.6 gigawatt hours of energy storage, down from 10.4 GWh in Q1 and just above Q2 2024's 9.4 GWh.

In Q3 2024, Tesla deployed 6.9 GWh.

Tesla FSD v14 Release

Musk said Sept. 25 on his social site X that Full Self-Driving v14 will have an ""early wide"" release this week. It's unclear if that means all FSD users with Hardware 4.0 will gain access, or if FSD v14 will initially go to a limited number, such as Tesla influencers. Tesla vehicles with HW3.0 will not get FSD v14.

Musk also wrote that FSD v14.1 should follow two weeks later, with v14.2 soon after. ""The car will feel almost like it is sentient being by 14.2,"" Musk wrote.

Musk has previously described FSD v14 as ""sentient."" In years past, Musk would refer to big Tesla FSD updates as ""mind-blowing"" or ""blow your mind.""

Tesla Stock

Tesla stock rose slightly in premarket trade. Shares rose 3.3% to 459.46 in Wednesday's stock market trading, hitting a fresh 2025 best. TSLA stock is closing in on the late December all-time high of 488.54. Investors could use that as a buy point, but Tesla currently is significantly extended from the 21-day and 50-day lines.

That said, recent advancements in cold climate heat pumps have significantly improved their efficiency and heating capacity in freezing weather, according to Natural Resources Canada.

Heat pumps outperform traditional HVAC systems in energy efficiency, with the clean energy nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute reporting that heat pumps are between 2.2 and 4.5 times more efficient than Energy Star-rated gas furnaces. This increased efficiency translates to lower energy bills, as it reduces electricity consumption by around 75%, per the Department of Energy. And since heat pumps can both heat and cool your home, you can enjoy savings all year round.

You can also snag a 30% tax credit (up to $2,000) for qualifying heat pumps through the Inflation Reduction Act, though you'll want to act by Dec. 31 when the incentives will expire.

Through EnergySage's free heat pump quotes comparison tool, you can get estimates from vetted installers and learn more about what incentives you're eligible for. Simply answer a few basic questions about your home's energy needs, and the company's energy advisors will connect you with qualified professionals who can help you find the right system for your budget.

If you want to reduce your energy bills further, you can check out EnergySage's free tools that allow you to compare solar quotes from reliable contractors and save up to $10,000 on installations and purchases. Pairing solar with a heat pump is one of the easiest ways to save big on electric bills while reducing pollution and environmental impacts.

Rivian narrowed its 2025 delivery guidance to 41,500–43,500 vehicles despite a 32% Q3 delivery surge.

The expiration of U.S. EV tax credits and high tariffs are increasing costs and creating uncertainty for the EV market.

Rising vehicle costs and supply chain pressures may impact Rivian’s profitability as it prepares to launch its R2 SUVs next year.

EV startup Rivian lowered its 2025 delivery guidance Thursday, projecting 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles for the year as it adjusts to the end of federal tax credits and rising manufacturing costs. The revision follows the company’s previous cut in May from as many as 51,000 vehicles.

Notably, the company reported a nearly 32% increase in third-quarter (Q3) deliveries, totaling 13,201 vehicles and surpassing analysts’ forecast of 12,690. The surge also reflects the rush by U.S buyers to secure tax credits before they expired Tuesday.

Industry analysts predict that the expiration of consumer tax credits could negatively impact EV sales and leasing in the coming quarters. In addition, tariffs on imported auto parts have increased production costs and compressed margins for EV makers, forcing companies like Rivian to reorganize supply chains, reduce foreign dependency, and expand U.S. manufacturing investments.

The combined pressures come as the EV maker prepares to launch its more affordable R2 SUV next year, a key step in its effort to boost profitability. Rising vehicle costs, coupled with policy changes, could impact margins as the company seeks to expand its market reach.

Further, Rivian’s leadership has emphasized that navigating these challenges will require careful management of production, costs, and inventory. Analysts note that while short-term delivery numbers may fluctuate, long-term growth depends on both the company’s ability to scale its more accessible models and ongoing shifts in U.S. EV policy.

Despite the uncertainties, Rivian’s Q3 performance shows that demand remains resilient when incentives are in place, even as the EV market adjusts to a changing policy environment and higher costs.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102025-Rivian-Q3-deliveries--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:06:05.052887

However, I’m making an exception today, because exploring the idea of “internalized capitalism” has helped me understand some of my own unhelpful ideas and behaviors, as well as those of my colleagues and external collaborators.
Upon reflection, I believe that internalized capitalism almost certainly played a role in that.
You may be suffering from internalized capitalism if you do any of the following: Prioritize work over health, relationships, pleasure, etc.
Internalized capitalism is typically presented as an entirely bad thing, but my perspective on it is somewhat more nuanced.","Regular readers of this column may have noticed that although I often write about the economy, I never use the word capitalism. This is not an accident. Many people have strong feelings about capitalism, either loving it or hating it, and those feelings are often rooted in narrowly partisan understandings of what capitalism actually is. As a result, discussing it can quickly deteriorate into unproductive bickering. I have no desire to participate in that, so I typically use the word extractive to refer to the problematic aspects of our economy and the word regenerative to advocate for redesigning our economy to equitably meet human needs and support human wellbeing, while repairing ecosystems and making it possible to live within the boundaries of what our planet can provide.

However, I’m making an exception today, because exploring the idea of “internalized capitalism” has helped me understand some of my own unhelpful ideas and behaviors, as well as those of my colleagues and external collaborators. This is top of mind for me right now, because I recently completed a three-month sabbatical, during which I had hoped/planned to prioritize rest (while also writing a book proposal), and though I did slow down somewhat, it was harder to let go of “the grind” than I had anticipated. Upon reflection, I believe that internalized capitalism almost certainly played a role in that.

In case you’re not familiar with the term, “internalized capitalism” describes when a person (usually unconsciously) adopts the values and expectations of a capitalist economy as their own internal standards, especially in regard to productivity, efficiency and accomplishments. You may be suffering from internalized capitalism if you do any of the following:

Prioritize work over health, relationships, pleasure, etc.;

Feel guilty or lazy for taking breaks or engaging in “unproductive” activities;

Tie your self-worth to your productivity, accomplishments, and/or economic success;

See everything as a competition and relentlessly pursue “wins”;

Believe that achievements, wealth, and/or material possessions will make you happy.

Internalized capitalism is typically presented as an entirely bad thing, but my perspective on it is somewhat more nuanced. I recognize that our economic system has created opportunities for innovation that have improved human wellbeing in a variety of ways. For example, I’m grateful for the invention of technologies like dishwashers and washing machines that make it quicker and easier for me to clean my house. In terms of how I have internalized this quality of our economic system, I suspect that my can-do attitude when it comes to problem solving may stem from the spirit of creativity and innovation that our economy fosters. On the flip side, it has probably also contributed to my general distaste for household chores, given that our economy chronically undervalues domestic labor.

During my sabbatical, I noticed that my urge to “be productive” sometimes undermines my ability to actually do good work. For example, my best ideas often come to me when I’m walking the dog, taking a shower, or gardening, but since those activities aren’t included in my job description and don’t look or feel like work, I’m reluctant to dedicate much time to them. So I’ll sit in front of my computer and struggle to figure something out that would immediately pop into my head if I were to just take a break. Then I end up spending even more time at my computer, because I feel like I didn’t accomplish enough, thereby creating a vicious cycle.

Though I’m concerned about my own tendency to overwork and don’t want my health and relationships to suffer because of my job, I believe my specific line of work (addressing the climate crisis) does warrant a sense of urgency and probably some degree of self-sacrifice. Furthermore, I’m typically good at being productive and efficient, and I don’t want those skills to go to waste, so as long as I am applying them toward the cause of making the world a better place, that seems like a strategic and responsible choice. However, I believe there’s truth in the famous Einstein quote about not being able to solve our problems with the same mindset that created them, and it’s clear to me that our culture’s relentless pursuit of more/bigger/faster is largely responsible for getting us into this mess in the first place, so learning to slow down and prioritize rest may actually be the more strategic and responsible choice for me and many other people over the long term.

Ultimately, my personal decisions about whether to work or nap are of little consequence, but as a broader society, it’s important for us to grapple with how our economic system shapes our beliefs about who we are and how we should spend our time and energy. Internalized capitalism is a systemic issue that plays out in our individual minds, and because our cultural obsession with productivity and personal gain can undermine our collective wellbeing, it’s in our best interest to recognize and resist its downsides. As described by The Stand Up Philosophers, those downsides include how capitalism’s “emphasis on individual success and competition… [leads] to social inequality and the marginalisation of those who are unable to keep up with the demands of the market.”

Ironically, writing this column has been unusually challenging for me and has taken much longer than expected, specifically because I am trying to catch up on all the work that didn’t get done during my sabbatical, while also resisting my own workaholism. My fundamental challenge is that I want and need to do more things than I realistically have time for, so compulsively striving for productivity and efficiency feels necessary and strategic. I’m therefore faced with the sad truth that if I don’t overwork, I will accomplish less, at least in terms of accomplishments that our economy and culture values. As it turns out, those external/internalized measures of my worth are surprisingly hard to let go of.

Repsol’s Texas Portfolio

Pecan Prairie represents the first project from Repsol’s 2024 acquisition of ConnectGen to advance into the construction phase. It also becomes the company’s fifth solar project in the U.S. to reach construction status.

The project joins Repsol’s expanding Texas portfolio, which already includes the 629 MW Outpost Solar Facility in Webb County, the 632 MW Frye Solar Project in Swisher County, and the 825 MW Pinnington in Jack County. Together, they bring the company’s total renewable capacity in the state to 2,681 MW under operation or development. Beyond Texas, Repsol also operates Jicarilla 1 and 2 in New Mexico, contributing an additional 145 MW, including 20 MW of storage.

Key Quote

At the groundbreaking ceremony, attended by company officials, suppliers, and community members, Federico Toro, CEO of Repsol Renewables North America, underscored the project’s dual role in advancing Repsol’s strategic targets and supporting local communities.

“With Pecan Prairie, we are executing on our acquisition of ConnectGen and advancing toward our U.S. renewable growth ambitions,” he said.

Regional Context

Texas continues to lead U.S. solar expansion thanks to the availability large tracts of land, high solar irradiance and an already set-up transmission infrastructure. Favorable regulatory policies and tax incentives also go without say especially with the Trump’s administration crackdown on renewables like wind and solar through policies and acts like the “Big Beautiful Big”.

Projects like Repsol’s Pecan Prairie, Outpost, Frye, and Pinnington also continue to form part of a cluster that is reinforcing Texas’s position as a key node in the U.S. clean energy transition.

Market Outlook

Large-scale solar projects in Texas are often in the not-urban counties. As with most investments, these bring capital inflow, jobs during construction, tax revenues, and often land leases with them.

On their own part, they also benefit from long-term PPAs and offtake contracts which help de-risk them as investments.

The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

The company reported Thursday that sales in the three months through September rose 7% compared to the same period a year ago. The gain follows two quarters of steep declines as people turned off by CEO Elon Musk's foray into right-wing politics avoided buying his company's cars and even protested at some dealerships.

Sales rose to 497,099 vehicles, compared with with 462,890 in the same period last year. Analysts expected sales to fall slightly to 456,000, even with a boost from customers seeking to use the electric vehicle incentive.

Tesla stock rose nearly 2% to $468.52 in early morning trading on the news.

Investors have been optimistic about the company in recent weeks, sending the stock up 34% in September alone. They are betting Musk’s planned new cheaper version of his bestselling Model Y will recharge sales. He had promised that car earlier this year. Now the launch is expected in the current quarter or early next year.

The rise in the stock also reflects Musk success in shifting attention away from car sales to other aspects of the business — the rollout of its driverless robotaxi service planned for several cities and its Optimus robots for factory work and household chores.

The 7% rise for the third quarter compares with a 13% plunge in the first quarter when Musk led President Donald Trump’s government cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. In the following three months through June, sales fell again 13%.

The backlash in Europe against Musk had been also been fierce with sales plunging 40% in more than two dozen countries after he publicly supported far-right politicians there.

Market share for new battery-electric vehicles was already stuck in single digits before the $7,500 tax incentive expired after Sept. 30. Now, forecasters are scaling back their targets as affordability worries deepen.

U.S. EV share will hover below 10 percent this year without federal support, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. It will likely rise to around 25 percent by 2030, she said. That’s just half of the most optimistic industry forecasts from a few years ago.

Still, 25 percent market share takes EVs out of the “‘niche’ category,” Valdez Streaty said. She urged automakers to address EV headwinds such as affordability and charging.

“The market’s going to have to figure out how to move forward with better product, more affordable product and educating consumers on why an EV is a good option,” she said.

Cox reported in September that EVs were about $9,000 more expensive on average than comparable gasoline models. EV incentives helped bridge the gap.

Ford CEO Jim Farley cautioned that Trump administration policies ending the EV credit and easing emissions rules on gasoline vehicles could shift sales away from electric models.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be way smaller than what we thought,” Farley said Sept. 30 at the Ford Pro Accelerate summit in Detroit. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the EV sales in this country go down to 5 percent of our industry.” Farley didn’t give a time frame.

Four years ago, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis issued a joint statement saying they aspired to achieve a 40-50 percent market share for EVs, including plug-in hybrids, by 2030. Then-President Joe Biden set his target at 50 percent.

Consulting firm EY said in September that EV adoption in the U.S. is now projected to reach 50 percent in 2039, five years later than previously forecast. It cited slower growth from the repeal of the EV incentive, tariffs and other policy changes.

EV growth will continue, analysts say

To be sure, it’s not all doom and gloom for battery-electric vehicles. Following an expected fourth-quarter sales dive, some analysts see a recovery next year as automakers increase incentives and launch more affordable models to sustain growth.

“Despite any short-term drop-off in electric vehicle sales or share, we do expect that to continue growing and it’s important not to lose sight of that,” said Brent Gruber, executive director of J.D. Power’s EV practice.

J.D. Power cut its forecast for 2030 EV share to 26 percent this year, 10 percentage points lower than last year’s projection.

But the data provider also found reasons for optimism: A recent consumer survey showed more than half of new-car shoppers were very likely or somewhat likely to consider an EV in the next 12 months.

“I’m a firm believer that there is a baseline level of interest in electric vehicles regardless of this chaos with incentives,” Gruber said.

J.D. Power projects U.S. EV retail share will stay flat at about 9 percent this year, rise to 12 percent next year and then climb gradually into the mid-teens by 2027 and the low-20s by 2029.

Current EV owners are expected to remain loyal to the fuel type while newcomers are drawn to fresh models and better charging infrastructure, Gruber said.

A separate survey showed 10 percent of U.S. consumers are likely to buy an EV for their next vehicle, Here Technologies and SBD Automotive said in September. That rises to 25 percent when asked if they are likely to buy one in the next five years.

EV demand debate

But not everyone is buying forecasts that 1 in 4 vehicles will be fully electric by the end of the decade. The Trump administration removed both the “carrot” for buying EVs — the tax incentive — and the “stick” by relaxing emissions rules.

“I’m fascinated to see where we end up with purely organic consumer-driven demand versus government putting their finger on the scale, which is what they’ve been doing for a long time,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. “In my opinion, we’re going to settle in around 4 percent, maybe a little lower.”

While electric vehicles are great for some use cases — such as urban driving in warm states such as California — automakers are better off investing in hybrids that reduce emissions without the charging and range hassles, Brauer said.

Some brands, facing financial pressures with tariffs and failed EV investments, are already pulling back, Brauer said, citing news reports on canceled EV projects.

“People ask when are EVs going to sell like internal combustion vehicles and I say not until they are just like combustion vehicles,” Brauer said. That means when they cost the same, can go 500 miles on a charge and refuel in under 10 minutes, he said.

I’m fascinated to see where we end up with purely organic consumer-driven demand versus government putting their finger on the scale, which is what they’ve been doing for a long time.

Some EV advocates aren’t worried about consumer demand, which is growing along with charging infrastructure, the number of affordable EVs in the U.S. market and consumer awareness. The U.S. may lag behind China and Europe, but the path is the same, they say.

“The major problem is going to be on the supply side not on the demand side,” said Loren McDonald, CEO of EV data firm Chargenomics. “What we’re starting to see is the automakers are all feeling like they’re getting permission to cut their losses.”

Acura ended production of the ZDX crossover after one model year, Nissan has paused U.S. sales of its Ariya crossover for the 2026 model year and Ram canceled its future EV pickup.

While automakers will likely use the current environment to kill off EVs that aren’t selling, McDonald said they’ll also work on a new generation “that are going to be way better and sell better.”

A few examples: Acura plans to launch its new RSX compact crossover next year on a new platform, Nissan has launched a new generation of the Leaf EV and startups Rivian and Slate have fresh models coming with a focus on value.

McDonald doubts that EV share will plunge to 4 percent. Sales will be sluggish short term, but then bounce back, he said.

“We’ll see some exciting new models, good lease prices and people are just going to forget about the tax credit,” McDonald said.

Leaders from Albemarle Corporation, the Aluminium Association of Canada, Old Harbor Native Corporation, Panasonic North America, and South32 contributed to the conversation.

Multiple participants weighed in on the challenges associated with the permitting process for critical mineral projects. Judy Brown, head of external affairs for the Americas at diversified mining company South32, emphasized the difficulties involved in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process: “When the lead agency and another agency do not agree, the issue is that strategic decisions just don’t get made,” and projects end up just sitting on the shelf in limbo. Kristina Woolston, CEO of the Old Harbor Native Corporation, a native village corporation based on Kodiak Island, Alaska, showed just how long a project can take. She previously worked on the Donlin Gold project, which she said took decades for design, exploration, engineering, and permitting, nearly seven years for the joint record of decision, and six years of litigation.

That experience is why Woolston is excited about the bipartisan Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, which would limit litigation standing to those who participated in the comment period and shorten the time to file suit to 150 days, rather than six years. “I think that’s so important for Native communities, because we are talking about extremely limited resources. We have partners that come to the table with us to help us develop these resources. But if we can’t bring in partners to help us develop, there’s no way we’d be able to afford it… So by utilizing the SPEED Act, we feel that it will encourage investors, because there will again be more liability and accountability.”

Alex Stroman, vice president of government relations and regulatory affairs at Albemarle Corporation, the world’s largest lithium company, the only one to be fully integrated “from mine to brine to market,” and the operator of the only active lithium mine in the U.S., in Silver Peak, Nevada, emphasized that the topic is bipartisan issue, adding that “the Trump administration has been excellent at prioritizing critical minerals.” He pointed to an executive order from March, which directed the National Energy Dominance Council to submit lists of priority projects to the Permitting Council for inclusion in the FAST-41 program, providing improved transparency and interagency coordination for streamlined environmental reviews and permitting support. Essentially, the executive order said, “We want to make it the policy of the United States to be the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals.”

Albemarle’s expansion of its lithium mine in Silver Peak, Nevada, and its construction of a lithium material processing plant in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, are both FAST-41 Transparency Projects involved in this process. Other leaders in the conversation noted that their projects had also been included in the FAST-41 program. Brown said that South32’s Hermosa project in Arizona, the country’s sole advanced mine development project capable of producing two critical minerals — zinc and manganese — was facing a five-year permitting schedule before it became a FAST-41 Covered Project. One of the benefits, she described, is that the program “relieved a lot of risks that people see around investing in the U.S.” Additionally, Woolston noted that Alaska recently became the first state to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Permitting Council for assistance through the FAST-41 program. She reflected, “It’s going to provide the accountability, the predictability, the reliability that projects need in Alaska… This will allow for investors to have some sense of reliability, that when they invest in a project, things are going to move forward.”

Tina Jeffress, group manager of sustainability and energy at Panasonic North America, emphasized the challenges of supply chain constraints and the importance of mineral processing. The company’s lithium-battery production facilities in Reno, Nevada, and De Soto, Kansas face difficulties as a midstream operation: “We can get the minerals we need, but we’re always trying to triangulate a really complicated formula between cost, location, carbon intensity, and some of those other responsibility factors, and so finding what we need, where we need to source from, at an appropriate price, is challenging.”

In terms of policy, Jeffress explained that longer-term incentives are essential for miners and refiners. For example, if the Section 45X credit is “a short-lived credit rather than a permanent one, I think it’s really hard for financing the mines and refineries that we want to see and that we need to see come online.” Albemarle’s Stroman added, “As we look for solutions and bringing processing back to the United States, it really takes a whole of government approach,” including public-private partnerships and trade agreements with other nations, because “if something isn’t done soon, it may be completely lost forever.”

Many of the companies are pushing forward with processing projects. Albemarle announced plans for a processing facility in Richburg, South Carolina, although it had to put the project on hold as prices continued to fall. Stroman expressed optimism for a “light at the end of the tunnel” due to the administration’s support for the sector, though. Panasonic, meanwhile, is working to secure sourcing and minimize supply chain risk, preferring the use of ‘carrots’ over ‘sticks.’ When it comes to recycling, for example, “I think there’s enough consumer attention there that if you put appropriate incentives in place, things would be moving a lot quicker,” Jeffress said.

Jean Simard, president and CEO of the Aluminium Association of Canada (AAC), also discussed recycling in depth. He explained that with every ton of aluminium, “we enable future generations to think, to design, to craft and to build the cities of tomorrow hundreds of years down the road.” He highlighted that approximately 1.5 billion tons of aluminium have been processed since the beginning of the industrial process in the 1880s, with 75% of that still standing in forms like televisions and washing machines in people’s homes. “Every time you remelt this aluminium, you only need 5% of the energy that was required to begin with,” he described. “So recycling is extremely important to us.” However, he acknowledged the need to influence consumer behavior at the end of product lifecycles to make sure the valuable material does not end up in landfills: “So you use taxes, you use mandates. It’s all stuff that requires very strong and well-coordinated policy making, and that’s the big challenge.”

Simard added that because the AAC represents Canada’s primary smelters and producers – including Rio Tinto, Alcoa, and Aluminerie Alouette – which are responsible for 80% of all primary aluminium produced in North America, trade between countries is essential for national security reasons. Canada ships 2.7 million tons of aluminium annually, equivalent to “four to six Hoover Dams, and it’s what is required to feed about 460 data centers to power AI.” The U.S., on the other hand, lost a significant portion of its capacity due to competition from China, which entered the market with lower prices. “Today, more than ever, we have to work together because the U.S. is in great demand for aluminium. For electrification, mostly because you need to build those transmission lines, which are using 100% primary aluminium for the lines. To have electric vehicles, you need to light-weight them with aluminium,” he explained.

Within the U.S., there also needs to be a focus on building out a workforce to advance these minerals and materials into substantial projects. South32’s Brown noted, “I think there’s a lot of ambition for critical minerals in the U.S., but I think we don’t have the right pipeline of people… So I think workforce development is critically important.” She pointed out that only about 100 mining engineers graduate in the country every year. South32 has already committed to an 80% local workforce for its Hermosa mine in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, where the company is teaming up with a local provisional college. Such efforts need to be escalated to meet the country’s energy demand.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/476433333_1194997582184606_3442388874212378128_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 10:59:59.889120

The funding supports three apprenticeship training partners:

Electrical Training Institute of Indianapolis

Electrical JATC of Northern Indiana

Fort Wayne Electrical JATC

These programs—joint efforts between the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA)—will use the funds to:

Integrate AI training into electrical apprenticeship curriculum

Expand enrollment through Apprenticeship Direct, a first-year training initiative

Provide apprentices with access to Google’s AI Essentials course

Increase training capacity to support 524 additional apprentices by 2030

That’s a 42% increase in Indiana’s projected pipeline of new electricians—directly addressing the shortage of skilled workers needed for clean energy, AI, and advanced infrastructure projects.

“This is about equipping the professionals who will modernize the grid and power tomorrow’s economy,” said Todd Stafford, Executive Director of etA. “We’re proud to work with Google to expand opportunities and invest in a future-ready workforce.”

Google.org says the investment aligns with its broader goal of supporting programs that build infrastructure for innovation and growth.

“Supporting the skilled trades is vital for powering Indiana’s future,” said Maab Ibrahim, Head of Economic Opportunity, Google.org. “We’re proud to help build a strong workforce that strengthens Indiana’s economy and technical capacity.”

The funding also reinforces local impact, with NECA leaders from Fort Wayne and Northern Indiana highlighting new opportunities for residents to build careers in the electrical trade—and advance quickly into leadership roles.

“This is more than training,” said IBEW President Ken Cooper. “It’s about building the workforce that will modernize America’s energy systems and strengthen communities across Indiana and beyond.”

This initiative builds on Google’s broader push to support American innovation. Earlier this year, the company released its policy roadmap, Powering a New Era of American Innovation, advocating for modernized energy systems to support AI and economic growth.

This project marks another successful collaboration between Vergent and Veregy, a NAESCO-accredited, energy services company (ESCO). The two companies first partnered in 2020 to bring a Capstone C65 system to Argos Community Schools in Indiana, a project that improved energy efficiency, lowered costs, and strengthened resiliency. Five years later, the project met or exceeded all of its energy conservation goals.

The new installations at VCS are the cornerstone of Valparaiso’s Phase 2 $17 million Guaranteed Energy Savings Contract (GESC). Phase 2 includes solar, retro-commissioning, and other energy efficiency upgrades. This Phase 2 project builds on the district’s earlier sustainability efforts, which have already generated more than $7.6 million in projected energy savings over 12 years through the use of solar arrays, LED lighting upgrades, HVAC enhancements, and real-time utility monitoring. Together, these efforts represent one of the most comprehensive K–12 energy efficiency programs in the state of Indiana.

“This Phase 2 project highlights how Valparaiso Community Schools is taking a holistic approach to energy efficiency and sustainability. The best kWh generated is always a kWh saved,” said Vince Canino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Capstone Green Energy. “We are proud to see our technology becoming part of VCS’s evolving microgrid fabric - working alongside their solar, lighting, and HVAC systems. Our ability to help deliver resiliency, affordability, and sustainability in a learning environment is a source of pride, and we’re honored to support the next generation by innovating today for a cleaner tomorrow.”

Fueled by clean natural gas, the four Capstone C65 systems will provide reliable, low-maintenance, and quiet on-site power, an especially important feature given their proximity to classrooms. By producing both electricity and heat, the CHP systems will further reduce utility costs and support the district’s long-term sustainability and resiliency goals.

“This repeat order from Veregy shows that microturbines are not just a one-off solution; they are a cornerstone of a long-term energy strategy,” said Justin Rathke, President of Vergent. “Their quiet operation and reliability make them an ideal fit for schools, and their ability to generate on-site power and heat helps clients like Valparaiso reduce costs and build a more resilient energy future.”

This installation represents another successful deployment of Capstone technology in the education sector, where energy efficiency, sustainability, and cost savings are critical. By producing both electricity and useful heat on-site, the schools will reduce their environmental footprint while ensuring a resilient energy supply for students and staff.

Donate Now Some of the most significant developments in vehicle-to-grid technology are happening in Europe.","A Maryland utility is touting a project that allows owners of Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickups to send power from their vehicles to the grid and get compensated for it.

The Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. project is a partnership with Ford, the automaker, and Sunrun, a solar and energy services company. It’s the kind of thing that, if deployed on a large scale, could be transformative for the grid.

But the nagging sense I get when reading about vehicle-to-grid pilot projects is that this is an opportunity that remains largely untapped. The Maryland project, for example, involves just three trucks.

Electric vehicles use the large majority of the lithium-ion batteries being produced in today’s market. When those EV batteries are sitting in garages and connected to chargers, they become a potentially vast resource that can be utilized by the grid, generating income for the vehicles’ owners. But to realize this opportunity, utilities, automakers and regulators need to move beyond pilot projects.

Also, the market share for EVs needs to continue to grow, and the Trump administration’s cancellation of the tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying a new EV is a setback. The tax credit ended this week, and analysts expect it will lead to a decrease in EV sales at least in the short term.

I spoke with Willett Kempton, a University of Delaware professor who first wrote about the potential of vehicle-to-grid power in 1997. That paper, co-authored with Steven E. Letendre, who was then at Green Mountain College in Vermont, had a central idea that seemed almost like science fiction at the time, when EVs barely existed. The paper’s title sums it up: “Electric vehicles as a new power source for electric utilities.”

One of its key points was that the technology for using EVs to power the grid was pretty simple. Consumers would need to have bi-directional chargers, capable of sending electricity from the grid to the battery, and from the battery to the grid. And grid managers would need software to control the flow of electricity to the grid.

Kempton found that groups of EVs could send power to the grid and receive compensation that would help to offset the costs of owning the vehicle. There would be almost no negative effect on battery life or the vehicle’s readiness for use.

“The economics are really compelling,” he said.

Here’s some of the math he found exciting: If the United States could get to the point that one-fourth of its vehicles were EVs with bi-directional chargers, they would provide the grid with access to 660 gigawatts of capacity. That figure, from a 2005 paper he co-authored, was close to the total capacity of all U.S. power plants at that time. Since then, other researchers have conducted their own versions of this calculation using more recent variables, underscoring the vast potential.

The main stumbling block turned out to be the reluctance of various stakeholders to agree on technical standards so that they would all be speaking the equivalent of the same language regarding how the system controls would work.

Only recently, decades after that 1997 paper, have most companies involved in vehicle-to-grid technology adopted a common set of charging standards. Now that the standards are in place, automakers and utilities have a much easier time setting up vehicle-to-grid programs than they would have before.

Progress is now happening with the development of laws and rules in the states and with pilot projects by companies such as Nuvve of San Diego, a leading player in vehicle-to-grid technology.

Nuvve’s U.S. projects include managing power from a fleet of electric buses in the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area.

At least eight states have recently enacted or introduced legislation or regulatory actions to foster vehicle-to-grid technology, according to the NC Clean Energy Technology Center. They are: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Delaware has been at the forefront, including the work of Kempton and his colleagues at the University of Delaware. Researchers there, sometimes in partnership with the utility Delmarva Power, have used vehicles from Nissan, BMW and other makers as part of various pilot projects.

One recurring theme across the states is that electric buses and fleet vehicles are a common early step for vehicle-to-grid technology because the batteries are large and they are often parked in a central location, making them easier to manage.

What I don’t see anywhere are projects with hundreds or thousands of residential EVs. In this way, vehicle-to-grid initiatives are not as far along as some of the efforts involving home battery systems used in virtual power plants, which are groups of batteries that work together to function like a power plant. Sunrun is a key player in virtual power plants and it has several vehicle-to-grid projects, including the one in Maryland.

Sunrun describes the Maryland initiative as the first in the country to use residential vehicles, as opposed to commercial or fleet vehicles. Last week, it announced that the vehicles had successfully sent power to the grid, after about a year of setting up systems to allow this to happen.

“In addition to showing how electric vehicles can power homes, add electrons to the grid, and help utilities meet peak electricity demand, this program also creates extra income opportunities for customers,” said Sunrun CEO Mary Powell in a statement.

Beginning in July, the utility had the ability to use power from the trucks during the peak demand hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays. The vehicles’ owners get paid based on the amount of electricity they share, which caps at $1,000 for a period that ran from July to September, Sunrun said.

Sunrun has been working with Ford to develop programs such as the one in Baltimore. The long-term goal is to make it commonplace for an EV owner to be able to use their vehicle’s battery for backup power at home or as an income source by selling power to the grid.

Some of the most significant developments in vehicle-to-grid technology are happening in Europe. BMW announced a program last month in Germany where consumers could receive essentially free charging at home in exchange for allowing their battery to provide power to the grid when it’s connected to a charger.

In 1997, Kempton expected that this technology would be much further along than it is today.

“I thought the world was going to beat a path,” he said.

But he is optimistic that today’s pilot projects indicate a market on the cusp of something big. He notes that most of the new EVs coming onto the market have built-in capability for bi-directional charging, and many utilities are in some phase of integrating this into their grid management.

So, let’s see a utility do a vehicle-to-grid project with hundreds or even thousands of vehicles. And let’s see it soon.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

The Consumer Credit for EVs Has Ended. What’s Next? The tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying or leasing an electric vehicle is no longer available after the clock turned to midnight on Oct. 1, the result of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Ford CEO Jim Farley said he thinks the sudden end of the credit could lead to a substantial contraction of the market, with EVs falling to as little as 5 percent of all new vehicles sold, about half as much as before, as Michael Wayland reports for CNBC. While it’s not much of a silver lining, the financing affiliates of Ford and General Motors have undertaken financial maneuvers that will allow those automakers to continue offering the $7,500 credit for leased vehicles at least until their current inventory is sold, as Mike Colias reports for Reuters. Analysts expect EV sales to plummet for the rest of 2025 as prospective buyers raced to make purchases before the end of the credit. What’s much less clear is what may be ahead in 2026 and beyond as automakers continue to introduce new EVs and the rest of the world is making a rapid shift to this technology.

States Are Key Battleground Now on Wind and Solar Permits: A new report tracks how states are taking a variety of approaches to issuing permits for new wind and solar projects, with some states adding restrictions and others reducing limits. According to the think tank Clean Tomorrow, 148 bills were introduced in the first half of this year that would make permitting more restrictive, while 89 bills were introduced that have a neutral effect and 68 would make it easier to get permits, as my colleague Aidan Hughes reports for ICN.

Solar Led the EU in Electricity Generation in June: Solar was the leading source of power in the European Union in June, generating 22 percent of the bloc’s electricity, which was slightly ahead of nuclear, as Pilar Sánchez Molina reports for PV Magazine. For the second quarter, renewable sources accounted for 54 percent of total electricity, up from 52.7 percent in the same period in the prior year. Denmark was the EU’s renewable energy leader, with 94.7 percent.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon found that the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) cap on state energy program funding is illegal. In New York, approximately $1.6 million in state energy program funding was at risk due to the DOE’s cap, which would have resulted in the elimination of 26 staff positions, according to New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office.

In a ruling from the bench on September 30, Judge Mustafa Kasubhai granted the attorneys general’s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the DOE policy violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The core pieces of the act establish how federal administrative agencies make rules and how they adjudicate administrative litigation.

The court said the policy would have slashed reimbursements for staffing and administrative costs and threatened to cut millions of dollars for essential energy programs.

Last month, James led a coalition of 18 other attorneys general and two governors in a lawsuit to block the DOE’s attempt to cap reimbursement of administrative and employee benefit costs at 10% of a project’s budget. The attorneys general argued that DOE’s cap violated federal law, disregarded states’ negotiated cost rates, and would undermine staffing and operations for state energy agencies.

This funding also helps the state ensure that its energy systems can withstand extreme weather or disasters, determine how electricity prices and market rules are set, and run annual practice drills so the state can respond quickly if the power grid or fuel supply is disrupted. According to the lawsuit, without full federal support, the state could have potentially had to cancel or delay programs that enable it to meet energy demand while prioritizing affordability.

Joining James in this lawsuit, which was co-led by the attorneys general of Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon, are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, as well as the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

“Once again, my office has successfully stopped the federal government from illegally cutting off funding that New Yorkers rely on,” James said. “These programs help families save money on their energy bills, prepare their homes for extreme weather, and build a more resilient future. DOE’s cap on funding is unlawful and dangerous, and today’s ruling ensures that New York will continue to get the resources it needs to deliver cleaner, safer, and more affordable energy for our communities.”",https://lilifepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2161143267-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 11:00:04.407807

To be eligible, participants must be customers of San Diego Community Power, own a home in Community Power’s service area and commit to installing a new solar-plus-battery system or have an existing solar system in place.
So in this time where the cost of living is a concern, we’re looking for ways to help our customers save money.” San Diego Community Power provides power for nearly 957,000 customer accounts for the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, La Mesa, Encinitas, Imperial Beach and National City, plus unincorporated areas of San Diego County.","San Diego Community Power announced Wednesday a $55 million initiative that will offer rebates and incentives to encourage its customers to install solar-plus-battery systems in their homes.

“This is a win-win that reduces strain on the (electric) grid and makes energy more reliable for everyone,” said Colin Santulli, senior director of programs at Community Power. “The program benefits all ratepayers by supporting local energy development through a network of residential batteries.”

For customers who qualify for the Solar Battery Savings program, Community Power will offer upfront rebates on the installation of rooftop solar systems that are paired with battery storage. Customers who already have solar but don’t have batteries can receive rebates on the battery system they install.

The amount of the rebates vary depending on the size of the installation, but when Community Power launched a pilot program last year, it attracted about 1,600 participants and the average incentive came to nearly $7,000 per battery.

The program also offers customers a performance incentive when they discharge 50% of electricity stored by their batteries between 4 and 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, when demand on the grid is at its highest and electricity prices are most expensive.

The weekday dispatch of 50% will result in a payback to the customer of 10 cents per kilowatt-hour.

“The board of directors of Community Power, building off the success of our pilot, has committed $55 million over the next five years to turn this into a full-time program,” Santulli said.

To be eligible, participants must be customers of San Diego Community Power, own a home in Community Power’s service area and commit to installing a new solar-plus-battery system or have an existing solar system in place.

To get started, go to SDCommunityPower.org/SBS and the website will connect customers to a list of qualified contractors in the area who can evaluate options, handle the paperwork and install the equipment.

“Small businesses are the heart and soul of San Diego and this program was built for family-owned businesses,” said Jake Marshall, operations manager for San Diego Greentech Renewables, a solar equipment provider that employs a staff of about 80.

The pilot program “gave San Diego contractors an opportunity to win against large national companies who outsource their labor and are headquartered in other states,” Marshall said.

Community Power’s Solar Battery Savings program comes as the 30% federal tax credit for residential solar, under Section 25D of the U.S. Tax Code, expires at the end of this year.

The cost of installing rooftop solar varies depending on the home, but the price tag can often reach $30,000.

But even with the federal tax credit sunsetting, Santulli said, “For most customers, installing a solar system with a battery is going to have long-term benefits to their bill over time. So in this time where the cost of living is a concern, we’re looking for ways to help our customers save money.”

San Diego Community Power provides power for nearly 957,000 customer accounts for the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, La Mesa, Encinitas, Imperial Beach and National City, plus unincorporated areas of San Diego County.

It’s one of 25 community choice aggregation, or CCA, programs that have sprung up across California in recent years.

On June 20, the department asked the court to deny Michigan’s motion to dismiss the federal lawsuit for lack of ripeness.

Motion With Brief in Support to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction by mcclallen

Nessel asked the judge to dismiss the federal lawsuit because her office has not yet filed any climate-related lawsuits.

The federal government counters that Michigan’s attorney general has taken credible steps to file the lawsuit, including:

Publicly vowing to sue the fossil-fuel industry over climate impacts,

Issuing a request for proposals seeking firms to bring such suits,

Laying out a scope-of-work statement that targets producers in and outside Michigan for the global climate crisis,

Retaining three out-of-state climate-litigation firms to prepare the case “vigorously,”

Refusing to disavow her intent to sue energy producers in exchange for a Justice Department offer to end the federal suit.

The Justice Department argues that all this shows a credible threat that the suit “is likely to come to pass.”

Michigan signed contracts with three out-of-state law firms that specialize in climate: Sher Edling LLP, DiCello Levitt LLP, and Hausfeld LLP, CapCon reported.

The U.S. says its lawsuit is ripe now because there’s a credible threat. Any state of Michigan lawsuits that rely on state law would intrude on exclusively federal terrain, the Justice Department said. The federal government also requested a permanent injunction to enjoin such state-law claims.

“Michigan invites this court to make believe that its threatened suit might not raise the sorts of claims that the United States argues are preempted: state-law claims for damages related to global climate change, whether sounding in nuisance, consumer protection, or some other state law. But Michigan offers no reason to expect that theoretical possibility, and there is none.”

DOJ RESPONSE in Opposition to MOTION to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction by mcclallen

The court filing encouraged Nessel’s office to sue energy companies over state-law claims, such as nuisance, consumer protection, trespass, negligence, products liability, public-trust, etc, that “functionally regulate global or out-of-state greenhouse-gas emissions.”

The Justice Department brought five arguments to support its position: Clean Air Act preemption; constitutional limits on extraterritorial regulation; Dormant Interstate Commerce Clause; Foreign Commerce Clause; and the Foreign Affairs Doctrine.

“The lawsuits share a common feature: plaintiffs use state statutes and state common law to bring claims against global energy producers rather than using federal law. By framing their lawsuits under state consumer protection statutes or state common law claims, plaintiffs attempt to sidestep federal preemption arguments.”

Michigan promised money to law firms that are filing similar lawsuits in multiple other states, the Justice Department noted.

“The firm (Sher Edling) has filed the same type of materially identical lawsuit dozens of times, including for Massachusetts, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and more,” said the federal response to Michigan’s motion to dismiss. “Its complaints for the States—all of which are filed against major energy producers (e.g., Exxon Mobil Corporation)—allege materially similar state-law claims.”

The climate lawsuit could target fossil fuel industry defendants, including but not limited to extractors, producers, transporters, refiners, manufacturers, distributors, promoters, marketers and sellers.

Nessel’s office hasn’t responded to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, a judge in South Carolina tossed with prejudice a climate lawsuit city in that state filed against oil companies.

“If these lawsuits were successful, municipalities, companies, and individuals across the country could bring suits for injuries after every weather event,” the judge wrote. “The list of potential plaintiffs is unbounded. Moreover, under Plaintiff’s theory, there is no reason to limit the universe of potential defendants to energy companies alone.”

The Aug. 6 ruling in South Carolina follows unfavorable rulings against state attorneys general by judges in New Jersey and Maryland.

Nessel has waged a war on fossil fuels, Joshua Antonini, an energy and environmental policy researcher at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, told CapCon in an email.

""The Department of Justice is right to counter AG Nessel's thinly veiled policy-through-litigation masquerading as rights protection. The war on fossil fuels — that is to say, the war on the energy that makes modern life possible and affordable for everyday people — is bad policy, let alone a foolish lawsuit.""",https://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/media/images/2024/sizes/1200w/MI%20oil%20and%20gas%20lawsuit.jpeg,N,,2025-10-02 09:59:13.009219

EV tax credits are dead in the US. Now what?

Federal EV tax credits in the US officially came to an end yesterday.

Those credits, expanded and extended in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, gave drivers up to $7,500 toward the purchase of a new electric vehicle. They’ve been a major force in cutting the up-front costs of EVs, pushing more people toward purchasing them and giving automakers confidence that demand would be strong.

The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country. So what’s next for the US EV market?

Of the five, Fort Bend has seen the fastest growth, with the county population increasing by over 40% in the past decade.
Even with the PurpleAir monitors, it can be difficult to know the causes of elevated PM2.5 in a given area.","When Leroy Wallace bought his retirement home in Fort Bend five years ago, he saw the perfect rural spot to help raise his grandkids – 1.3 acres of land with a small lake in the backyard.

His view also featured the soaring stacks of NRG’s coal- and gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station, which sits less than two miles from his door. The blip on his horizon did not bother him at first.

“I asked the real estate agent, ‘Did that present a hazard to the area?’ He said, ‘No, it’s clean-burning.’ So I didn’t think about it,” Wallace said.

Wallace didn’t have a way to double-check what was really in his air. Despite the county’s sharp population growth, Fort Bend has no official air pollution monitors set up by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

But a new Houston Chronicle analysis of air-quality data from PurpleAir – a company that provides lower-cost, community-installed air monitors – shows worrisome pollution levels in Fort Bend County near where Wallace lives.

READ MORE: Toxic air is plaguing this Houston neighborhood, with no help in sight

Across the Houston metropolitan area, Texas regulators have 13 official air monitors capable of measuring tiny pollution particles. Within the same boundaries, more than 50 PurpleAir monitors take similar measurements, filling in gaps in communities like Wallace’s that lack the costly regulatory versions.

Recent annual averages from two PurpleAir monitors near the W.A. Parish power plant showed particulate matter levels exceeded newly tightened health standards for air pollution that were updated by the EPA in 2024, according to data analyzed by the Houston Chronicle.

The strengthened rules may not stick — federal officials promised this spring to revisit them as part of the Trump administration’s deregulation push. But the Chronicle’s analysis revealed that pollution levels recorded by TCEQ and PurpleAir monitors alike are on the rise.

In response to the high readings near the generating station, NRG spokesperson Erik Linden said that “there are many source categories that contribute to PM2.5 concentrations in the airshed,” and that the company is committed to complying with local, state and federal regulations.

Enforcement and permitting for both state and federal air emissions rules fall mainly under the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which said it is not able to assess the particulate pollution levels in Fort Bend collected by PurpleAir monitors.

“TCEQ does not perform modeling or other analyses to determine compliance with the standard in counties without regulatory monitors,” agency spokeswoman Victoria Cann said in a statement.

The EPA itself uses PurpleAir’s real-time data to illustrate national air quality. Asked why Texas environmental officials don’t use PurpleAir monitors to assess the region’s air against annual health standards, TCEQ spokesman Richard Richter said: “Low-cost sensors in general do not meet the stringent requirements outlined by EPA to be used for regulatory monitoring under the Clean Air Act.”

What’s in Fort Bend’s air?

Local research suggests the air near W.A. Parish is not benign.

A peer-reviewed study published in 2019 by Rice University scholars found the massive coal- and gas-burning power plant causes an estimated 178 premature deaths each year, mostly from fine particle pollution.

Some of those particles are released from the plant as soot, but many are byproducts of gaseous sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides in its emissions that mix with other molecules to form fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5.

Plant representatives have called the Rice research into question, but said they did not have the data necessary to check its specific conclusions.

PM2.5 can lead to heart disease and asthma, among many health problems, when the tiny fragments lodge in people’s lungs and cardiovascular systems.

State regulators at the TCEQ are responsible for tracking air pollution. If a community’s air quality is bad enough, regulators are supposed to make a plan to fix it.

But to make that decision, they only use data from their own costly, high-tech air monitors – the type that does not exist in Fort Bend.

At the end of last year, the state agency’s staff decided that Fort Bend should be one of 224 counties considered “attainment/unclassifiable” for federal particle pollution limits, meaning it would be off the hook regardless of its pollution levels given its lack of official monitors. This means Fort Bend residents will get no help from state regulators to bring pollution levels down.

Wallace has not done a deep dive on data gaps, but said he got scared when he first learned about the hazards from the coal plant in his backyard.

“You know, I don’t want my grandkids to get cancer, or me and my wife. That's a very real possibility,” Wallace said.

“The plant’s not going away. If they can't control this, then I'll have to move, for my family.”

Suburbs left out of air quality monitoring

The gap in regulatory monitors in Fort Bend worries some residents who say air quality is not being taken into consideration even as the county’s population balloons.

“New communities are being built right around some of the largest polluters in the country, specifically W.A. Parish,” local environmentalist Vero Piña told regional leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency during their visit to the area last year.

These regulatory monitors are heavily concentrated within Harris County’s borders and largely absent in the region’s sprawling suburbs.

Fort Bend is not alone. Four of the five Houston-area counties with the largest recent uptick in population – Fort Bend, Chambers, Waller and Liberty Counties – feature no regulatory air monitors at all.

Of the five, Fort Bend has seen the fastest growth, with the county population increasing by over 40% in the past decade.

Still, it can take years for a new state air monitor to be sited and installed, and even longer for that monitor to collect enough data that the state can start to use it for regulatory purposes.

“Monitors are placed in accordance with federal air monitoring requirements using population trends, reported emissions inventory data, local meteorological data, and, if available, existing air monitoring data for a given area,” said Richter, spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

In their most recent air monitoring network plan, TCEQ authors said the agency already has 69 monitors across the state that measure fine particulate pollution, far more than it is required to set up. They said federal law demanded only 40.

“The number, type, and location of monitors within the TCEQ federal monitoring network is sufficient to characterize air quality for all areas required within Texas,” the report said.

Texas has 254 counties, the most of any American state. Only 13% monitor PM2.5.

Information gaps and policy pushback

In Texas, air monitoring gaps are just one aspect of the stalemate between environmental groups and government officials over how bad the state’s pollution levels really are.

In 2024, Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the federal government over its update to an annual particle pollution cap under the Clean Air Act.

This update is based on a legally mandated review of health science. Federal officials considered everything from pollution-related deaths to economic impacts and decided to cut the annual average pollution limit by one quarter – pulling it down from 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m³) to 9.

Though the Clean Air Act is federal law, it is up to individual states to enforce it. TCEQ staff began that process in the spring of 2024.

Abbott’s decision to call the new limit unlawful and say Texas was entirely in the green had immediate implications.

Any time a county or metropolitan area is out of attainment for a National Ambient Air Quality Standard over a three-year period, its state is required to take action. Texas would have started that process by developing a State Implementation Plan for federal approval; such a plan could take practical measures in a given county, like imposing new rules that limit emissions, or adding requirements for existing facilities.

Now, Texas will make no such plan in response to the new standard. But even if it did, the plan may have turned out differently than usual. While Texas has jousted for years with EPA staff over how transformational its plans need to be, new agency administrator Lee Zeldin has promised an approach that defers more readily to states.

“Clearing out the State Implementation Plan backlog will make significant strides to improving the air we breathe,” Zeldin said in a March statement.

Many local environmentalists disagree, worried that increased deference to states will nix the federal backstop that pressured Texas regulators for decades to be more strict on pollution.

Taking matters into the community’s hands

Piña, who serves as vice-chair of the local nonprofit Fort Bend County Environmental Organization, is one of the local and state environmental advocates worried about the data gap and state inaction.

They have spent the last few years trying to flood the Houston area with an alternative: A network of lower-cost laser particle monitors that residents can install on their homes and read themselves.

One common monitor brand Houstonians have set up is PurpleAir, the network used in the Houston Chronicle’s new analysis. The brand has a nationwide network of monitors that individuals can purchase and install, and the company then provides access to both real-time and historical data on particle pollution. The federal EPA even uses that PurpleAir data for a publicly available real-time tool, as does the Chronicle.

Even with the PurpleAir monitors, it can be difficult to know the causes of elevated PM2.5 in a given area. While two monitors to the northeast of Parish show annual average PM2.5 levels of about 9.6 micrograms per cubic meter for 2024, two other monitors to the northwest show levels below 9 micrograms. Variables like wind direction and humidity can have a substantial impact on where and how far PM2.5 travels.

A county needs only one regulatory monitor with average readings above the national standard to be considered out of compliance with the law.

Houston’s rapidly-expanding metropolitan area has seen pollution levels trending upward for the past several years, in a reversal of over a decade of gradual improvement.

Fort Bend is one of two Houston-area counties, along with Montgomery, that were marked as “unclassifiable” due to a lack of data by the TCEQ staff analysis in 2024, despite having one or more PurpleAir monitors with an annual average worse than the updated federal standard.

The threshold that these suburban Houston counties fail to meet may not be around for long, though. On March 12, the EPA’s Zeldin announced his agency would revisit the published rule as part of a historic effort to cut back environmental regulations.

While the federal agency periodically strengthens health limits for particulate pollution, it has never weakened the limit in an already-implemented regulation.

Zeldin said the decision would help “unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.”",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/0/0/0/0/24048704/1/rawImage.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:27.562633

Waste360: Why is lithium-ion battery recycling such a critical issue at this moment in time?
Crapps: Battery use is skyrocketing across EVs, consumer electronics, and energy storage, and so is demand for the metals inside them.
Waste360: Looking ahead, what impact could this initiative have on the future of lithium-ion battery recycling in the U.S.?","As the use of lithium-ion batteries grows rapidly across electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and energy storage, so does the need for safe and sustainable recycling solutions. With millions of devices reaching end-of-life each year, the importance of keeping these batteries out of landfills and recycling streams has never been greater. To address this challenge, Redwood Materials has partnered with the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) and the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SC DES) to launch an education and awareness campaign promoting responsible lithium-ion battery recycling.

Leading these efforts in the Southeast is Morgan Crapps, Director of Public Affairs & Government Relations at Redwood Materials. In her role, Morgan oversees external affairs and works closely with public and private partners to build a closed-loop, domestic supply chain for lithium-ion batteries. Redwood, headquartered in Nevada and expanding into South Carolina, is pioneering a model that combines recycling, refining, and remanufacturing, all on the same continent, to return critical battery components to U.S. manufacturers.

In a Q&A with Waste360, Morgan shares insights into Redwood’s work with ESFI and SC DES on the Be Battery Smart initiative, explains why lithium-ion battery recycling is such a pressing issue today, and outlines how consumers, communities, and the waste industry can all play a role in building safer and more sustainable recycling practices.

Waste360: Can you start by describing the roles and involvement behind this lithium-ion battery recycling initiative?

Crapps: Redwood is working with ESFI and SC DES (as part of their Be Battery Smart initiative) on an education & awareness campaign that promotes responsible lithium-ion battery & rechargeable device recycling. This collaboration brings together Redwood, the largest lithium-ion battery recycler in North America, with ESFI, a national leader in electrical safety, and SC DES, South Carolina’s environmental agency, in their shared mission to raise awareness around lithium-ion battery recycling.

Waste360: Why is lithium-ion battery recycling such a critical issue at this moment in time?

Crapps: Battery use is skyrocketing across EVs, consumer electronics, and energy storage, and so is demand for the metals inside them. Mining and refining are resource-intensive and often concentrated in regions with heightened geopolitical risk. Recycling keeps critical minerals, like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, in circulation and helps build a secure, domestic battery supply chain, while keeping batteries out of the waste stream.

Waste360: What risks do lithium-ion batteries pose when they end up in the trash or regular recycling streams? How serious is the fire threat at MRFs and landfills caused by improperly discarded lithium-ion batteries? What measures can waste and recycling operators take to help reduce the risks associated with these batteries in their facilities?

Crapps: Like most other batteries, lithium-ion batteries should not be disposed of in the regular trash or recycling bin. They should be recycled with specialized battery recyclers, such as Redwood, who have the expertise to safely manage and recycle them.

While lithium-ion batteries can cause fires if mishandled, the risk is often overstated. Like many materials in the waste stream, batteries pose hazards that are well-managed with proper handling. The difference is that these types of batteries are newer, so public awareness and infrastructure are still catching up. By educating consumers and building convenient recycling solutions, we can manage lithium-ion batteries safely—just as we’ve learned to do with other common household items.

Waste360: How do the drop-off locations created through this initiative operate, and how can consumers find one near them?

Crapps: There are multiple ways to recycle with Redwood. Redwood has over 40 drop-off locations in South Carolina, largely concentrated around the Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville metro areas, and hundreds across the country, which can be found here. Members of the public can also recycle batteries at their local household hazardous waste facility. In addition to drop-off locations, members of the public can ship their batteries directly to Redwood for recycling OR host their own event in their community to collect batteries & devices. Follow the instructions on our website for safe shipping or check out this article for more information on hosting an event.

Waste360: What types of devices and batteries are accepted at these collection sites?

Crapps: Redwood accepts rechargeable devices that contain lithium-ion or nickel-metal hydride batteries, such as:

Waste360: Beyond safety, what broader benefits does lithium-ion battery recycling provide for the environment, the economy, and U.S. energy independence?

Crapps: Recycling lithium-ion batteries and the rechargeable devices that contain them is essential for several reasons:

Waste360: Redwood reports a recovery rate of more than 95% for critical minerals. What happens to those recovered materials once they are processed?

Crapps: That’s right - Redwood’s technology can recover, on average, more than 95% of materials like nickel, cobalt, copper, aluminum, lithium and graphite in a lithium-ion battery. These materials can then go directly back into the supply chain to make batteries for new products.

Waste360: How does this campaign build on ESFI’s ongoing work around lithium-ion battery safety?

Lithium-ion battery safety is one of ESFI's key campaigns. Over the last few years, ESFI has been engaging the public, as well as working with partners like Redwood Materials, ReMA, and NFPA, to educate individuals on the proper sourcing, use, charging, and recycling of lithium-ion powered devices. As the world becomes more electrified and the demand for lithium-ion powered devices grows, ESFI is at the forefront of messaging to help consumers make safe choices, and Redwood Materials is an excellent partner for this. Lithium-ion powered devices are safe as long as they aresourced, used, charged, and recycled correctly.

Editor's note: This question was answered by ESFI.

Waste360: What role does the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services play in expanding this campaign’s reach and education efforts?

SCDES has been hard at work raising awareness of safety concerns and recycling opportunities through its “Take Charge, Be Battery Smart” public outreach campaign. Redwood and SCDES proudly partner on many initiatives to bolster battery recycling within South Carolina and SCDES even hosts a Redwood recycling location at its headquarters in Columbia.

Editor's note: This question was answered by SCDES.

Waste360: How can haulers, MRFs, and landfill operators partner with initiatives like this to improve battery safety and recycling rates?

Crapps: Please reach out to us at recycle@redwoodmaterials.com! We’d love to collaborate with you to set up collection sites, provide education, and find other solutions to get the word out about recycling.

Waste360: What best practices should waste industry professionals be promoting to help educate customers and communities about safe battery disposal?

Crapps: Professionals should encourage customers to tape terminals, bag loose batteries, and use dedicated recycling programs instead of tossing batteries in the trash. Sharing clear, consistent messaging helps build safer habits across communities.

Waste360: Survey data shows that more than half of Americans don’t know how to recycle their old lithium-ion devices. What barriers contribute to this lack of awareness?

Crapps: One of the initial barriers we often see is that many people don’t know they have lithium-ion batteries in the first place. Look around your home and chances are, you’ll find lithium-ion batteries everywhere. They power smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other portable electronics. They’re also used in power tools, cordless vacuums, and various smart home devices. Once people know how to identify these devices, they are more likely to make responsible decisions when it comes to safe disposal.

“Policy is key to scaling CCUS,” Jamie Burrows, He | RSS.com

A Growing Pipeline of Projects

EIP identified 17 industrial CCS projects in Louisiana’s chemical, refining, and liquefied natural gas sectors that would qualify for the credit. Collectively, these projects estimate capturing 42 million metric tons of CO2 per year.

In total, Louisiana hosts 43 CCS projects and 10 CO2 pipelines in development, including 22 regional hub concepts designed to aggregate emissions from multiple industrial sites for shared transportation and storage infrastructure.

Some of the largest proposed facilities carry billion-dollar tax credit potential:

Ascension Clean Energy Facility (Ascension Parish) – With plans to capture 12 million tons annually, the site alone could generate $1 billion in credits each year.

Air Products Darrow Blue Energy (Ascension Parish) and St. Rose Blue Ammonia (St. Charles Parish) – Each could qualify for about $425 million annually.

G2 Net-Zero Energy Complex (Cameron Parish) – Roughly $340 million annually.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation’s deliver on that commitment,” Wright said in a statement.

One of the canceled awards is for the ARCHES hydrogen hub in California, according to a letter to grant recipients from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations viewed by POLITICO’s E&E News. The letter directed ARCHES officials to cease all project activities after Oct. 1. “Effective immediately, you may not incur any new project costs and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible,” the letter said.

In a statement, ARCHES CEO Angelina Galiteva said the decision “ignores the critical benefits our projects will deliver” but said projects would continue with help from state leaders and the private sector.

Bloomberg News said Tuesday the scrapped funding covers renewable projects and another hydrogen hub in the Pacific Northwest, according to an unnamed administration official. Pacific Northwest hub did not respond to request for comment Tuesday, but like ARCHES, it is a backer of wind and solar energy.

The two hubs were expected to receive up to $2.2 billion from the federal government as part of a nationwide network to demonstrate the transport and production of clean fuel. They were the first two hubs to ink a financial deal with the Biden administration last year.

There are five other hydrogen hubs slated to receive funding under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, including multiple projects that would demonstrate “blue” hydrogen using natural gas tied to carbon capture. Overall, the infrastructure law provided roughly $7 billion for the hubs. DOE did not respond to a request for comment about the canceled projects.

In the Tuesday evening statement, the department said award recipients would have 30 days to appeal a termination decision. Some projects already have appealed cancellations, it said.

In May, Wright released a memo outlining the process for a department-wide review, saying among other things that projects needed to be financially viable and aligned with administration priorities. Last week, Wright announced that $13 billion for clean energy projects was being returned to the Treasury Department, although those were unobligated funds called for the in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The new project cancellations were anticipated after White House budget chief Russ Vought said on social media Wednesday that the administration would cancel nearly $8 billion in energy projects in 16 states that backed former President Joe Biden in the November election.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled. More info to come from @ENERGY,” Vought wrote on X.

“The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA,” he said.

The comments sparked outrage Wednesday from Democrats, who said the cancellations are illegal and would raise electricity costs.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills. This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats–it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

“It is dangerous, it is destructive and it is unconscionable to us that Chuck Schumer should do this, and could do this, for his personal political reasons,” Johnson said, referring to the Democratic leader from New York, who on Wednesday led his caucus for a third time in voting against a short-term funding bill crafted by Republicans.

The Senate will be out Thursday for Yom Kippur but back Friday. Republicans plan to hold votes on that same funding patch Friday and over the weekend as a way to hammer Democrats for their opposition. The GOP has repeatedly rejected an alternative Democratic bill.

As that drama plays out, a bipartisan group of senators have been talking about a deal on health care subsidies, a major sticking point, though a resolution does not seem close at hand.

The White House said Wednesday that additional layoffs of federal workers was “imminent,” arguing such actions were needed during the shutdown. Two labor unions representing federal workers have already filed suit, calling the anticipated firings illegal.

President Donald Trump said his administration could use the shutdown to target Democratic priorities, and as Johnson and Republican leaders were getting ready for their press conference, the White House followed through.

Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the administration was freezing roughly $18 billion slated for major transit projects in New York City, the home state of Congress’ Democratic leaders.

Then, as lawmakers huddled on the Senate floor discussing potential offramps to end the shutdown, Vought posted on X that the Trump administration is canceling nearly $8 billion “in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” — with all of the funding being pulled from states that voted against President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats — it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” said Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.). “We’ve never had an administration work so hard to hurt the people they represent.”

‘Naked and brazen corruption’

Several Republican senators — including Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee in charge of the funding in question — declined to comment Wednesday afternoon, saying they did not know details about the cuts. Others were gleeful.

“Great!” Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said on X.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) wrote, “Good. END THE GREEN NEW SCAM.”

Democrats seethed at the announcement. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who authored the technology-neutral energy tax credits that Democrats enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, said Vought’s approach of singling out Democratic-favored forms of energy “is the opposite” of technology-neutral.

“It’s politics-driven: Single people out, make a big production out of it, try to flex your muscles if you have a question about some state,” Wyden said in an interview.

“He can make up whatever fantasy-land language he wants to use, but technological neutrality is going to be the future of what we do in terms of energy policy, and that’s not a scam,” Wyden said.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) suggested the White House action is illegal because it appears to blatantly restrict funding based on politics.

Vought said the impacted projects would be in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

“Were they a little more careful, they would have sprinkled in a Republican state or two,” Schatz said. “I do not think this will hold up in court.”

One victim was the ARCHES hydrogen hub in California. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) called the move “vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

One Democratic senator said the administration’s actions served as reason for Democrats to double down in support of their proposed funding bill. The Democratic continuing resolution contains language to prevent the White House from unilaterally canceling or repealing funds appropriated by Congress.

“Time to stiffen our spines and demand that we only fund a government that obeys the law,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who called the move to target only Democratic-led states “naked and brazen corruption.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) said on a call with reporters Wednesday that the shutdown could hamper the administration’s stated goal of increasing energy production and lowering Americans’ electricity bills.

“This is an administration that says they want to expedite new energy facilities. It ain’t happening if there aren’t people to process permits,” Casten said.

Flood insurance: ‘huge impact’

Until the National Flood Insurance Program is reauthorized, current and prospective homeowners will not be able to renew or buy flood insurance, which in some areas is required.

The Defense Production Act — which presidents have used to boost domestic production of everything from solar panels and heat pumps to critical minerals and Covid-19 vaccines — similarly lapsed overnight.

The House Financial Services Committee has jurisdiction over both programs. Chair French Hill (R-Ark.) and other Republicans said Democrats were responsible for the shutdown and therefore the lapses in authorization because they voted against the GOP funding patch, which would have extended both programs. But Republicans voted against the Democratic funding patch, which also included those extensions.

“With Senate Democrats voting against this critical funding, the NFIP and DPA have now expired, hurting at-risk property owners across our nation and harming the ability for our government to speed up production of necessary supplies if there is a national security crisis,” Hill said in a statement.

Kennedy, who often tries to extend the NFIP ahead of its expiration, said he would not try to renew it this time because “it’s pointless.” He said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has “made it very clear” that he would object to a request for unanimous consent to reauthorize the program, as he has in the past.

Asked Wednesday if he would in fact object, Paul declined to comment. He has called the NFIP a federal subsidy for expensive beach homes.

The NFIP lapse “will have a huge impact on the housing market, which is already depressed,” Kennedy said. “Rand’s objection is silly, and he knows it’s silly, but there’s not much I can do about it.”

Disaster funding

FEMA’s disaster relief fund has about $5 billion remaining, per FEMA’s most recent funding report, but that balance could evaporate with the next major storm, and there would be nothing left over to cover other disaster costs.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) spoke about the need for more funding on the Senate floor Wednesday, a few days after the anniversary of Hurricane Helene’s rampage through his home state.

He noted that FEMA’s major-disasters account had about $1.4 billion remaining last month and that the agency approved $7.5 billion from that account the previous month alone.

The remaining funding “is dangerously low,” Tillis said.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re in a shutdown posture right now,” he said. “We are not prepared for another major disaster should it hit this weekend, nor do we have the money that we need to help communities across this country.”

Most FEMA and National Weather Service employees are typically excluded from furloughs during shutdowns, and agency employees have said they do not anticipate forecasting and response operations to be impacted by the shutdown.

Still, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee expressed alarm this week about potentially unforeseen impacts during the shutdown.

The Trump administration has “gutted forecasting offices and left out to dry the National Weather Service employees who work to keep Americans safe and informed in the path of severe weather,” said ranking member Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.).",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/50/49/1132d4ce4b78b4d3e3f124b1a0a9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2160963660,N,,2025-10-02 12:07:33.498953

Five of the new electric buses were introduced to the city on Clean Air Day, which meant free fares for all citizens. B-Line coincided with the launch of the new electric vehicles with a rebrand, including a new logo and website.

“Our theme right now is ‘Building a Better B-Line,’” BCAG Transportation Analyst Amy White said. “We’re naming each of our services so everybody will be able to differentiate which service they’re looking for.”

Along with the standard buses, B-Line will also introduce two more electric vehicle lines: B-Line Plus and B-Line Flex.

B-Line Plus is a rebrand of the existing paratransit service. B-Line Flex is a new “microtransit” service that White said will be introduced around springtime. White also added that they have their sights set on creating a Chico to Sacramento segment, which would be called B-Line Link.

B-Line began the launch with only five buses, which are only running in Chico for now, and White said the initial launch had a limited number of vehicles to see how they perform.

“It’s not a trial period, because we’re not getting rid of them, but we just want to see how they work and see what we can use them for,” she said.

BCAG Executive Director Andy Newsum said that they are trying to keep them under their range of 150 miles for now by keeping the buses in Chico, but said that they will eventually go farther.

“We want to first run them in Chico and make sure they deliver 150 miles or less per run between charges and see how they hold,” he said. “We’ll go farther if we get to a comfort level that we can go farther, and that might be some of the outer lines in Chico.”

The launch of the new electric vehicles comes after a 2018 regulation from the California Air Resources Board, which set a statewide goal for public transit agencies to transition to 100 percent zero-emission bus fleets by 2040.

Newsum said that while the clear benefit of switching to electric vehicles is that fossil fuels are no longer being burned, there is still a footprint when it comes to building batteries, as well as what happens to the batteries when they are no longer operational.

“Every technology has its pluses and minuses. For us, we’re going to be trading buying electrons for buying gasoline,” Newsum said. “Is that going to be good for us? We’ll see.”",https://www.orovillemr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BLINE-07.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-10-02 08:59:56.768576

(828newsNOW) — The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality has awarded more than $1.1 million in grants for projects designed to cut air pollution from diesel-powered vehicles and equipment.

The Division of Air Quality announced $1.14 million in Mobile Source Emissions Reduction grants this week, including funding for one Buncombe County business and three in Swain County.

The program supports projects that replace or retrofit older diesel-powered vehicles with cleaner technology. This year’s awards will fund purchases ranging from electric utility vehicles and natural gas-powered trucks to new construction equipment that meets modern emissions standards. More than $270,000 of the funding will go toward new electric vehicles, according to DEQ.

The largest award — $289,380 to Cumberland County — will replace a box truck and two bulldozers with newer, more efficient models. Other recipients include Delta Air Lines, which received $268,248 to swap out six diesel belt loaders at Raleigh-Durham International Airport for electric models, and Waste Management of Carolinas in Buncombe County, which was awarded $120,000 to replace four diesel vehicles with near-zero emission compressed natural gas trucks.

Swain County companies receiving grants include Espinoza Hauling and Trucking Co. ($185,991), Fortner Contracting Inc. ($62,039) and HMC Paving and Construction Co. ($19,913).

The grants are funded through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program, which targets pollution from diesel engines, a source of fine particulate matter and other pollutants linked to asthma, heart disease and environmental damage.

In 2023, the state program funded the replacement of 18 vehicles and cut more than 43 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions and 3,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the lifetime of the equipment.

More details on the grant program are available here.

Spirit Halloween is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday-Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sundays.

Read about Spirit Halloween in last year’s feature on the store.

Spirit Halloween specializes in costumes of all kinds, but is particularly useful for finding easy outfits for recent pop culture staples, such as Smoke from “Sinners,” the suit from the new “Superman” or The Grabber from “The Black Phone,” a 2021 horror movie getting a sequel later this month.

The most iconic items offered at Spirit Halloween, however, are the animatronics. Every year, the Halloween pop-up builds an ISE, or In-Store Experience, an elaborate themed display filled with moving ghouls and scary sets. Last year, for instance, the store hosted a “Carnevil” display of haunted fair games. This year, the ISE is called “Madison Scare Park,” resembling a scary, dilapidated subway car.

Jim Farley, the head of Ford Company, expressed concern about the future of the electric vehicle market in the USA. He noted that this market may turn out to be significantly smaller than previously expected. Currently, electric cars account for 10 to 12 percent of the American automotive market, but the situation could change dramatically.

Impact of Tax Incentive Cancellation

The cancellation of the federal tax incentive for electric vehicles has significantly impacted the industry. Without the $7,500 incentive, Farley fears that demand for electric vehicles in the USA could drop sharply, and sales could be halved. This underscores how important this credit was for the country’s transition to electric vehicles.

During the “Ford Pro Accelerate” event in Detroit, Farley stated that electric vehicles might soon constitute only 5 percent of the total US automotive market, matching the 2022 level and significantly below the expected 10-12 percent this month. Such a forecast points to a more modest future for electrification than many experts had anticipated.

Industry Development Prospects

I believe it will be a viable industry, but it will be smaller, much smaller than we thought, especially considering the changes in tailpipe emission policy and the cancellation of the $7,500 consumer incentive. We will find out in a month. I wouldn’t be surprised if US electric vehicle sales drop to 5%.

According to Farley, the Ford Model e team is constantly analyzing the demand for electrified vehicles. The manufacturer will also have to adjust plans and decide how to utilize excess capacity for electric vehicle production and its battery plants.

Adaptation to New Conditions

We will fill them, but it will be additional stress because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy has changed. All of us will have to adapt, and I believe it will be beneficial for the country, but it will be another challenge.

During the same event, Farley also acknowledged that Ford’s customers are not interested in expensive electric vehicles. Therefore, the automaker needs to create cheaper electric models, but after the cancellation of the tax credit, this will become much more difficult.

Customers are not interested in $75,000 electric vehicles. They find them interesting. They are fast, efficient, you don’t need to refuel, but they are expensive.

These changes in policy and market conditions could lead to a revision of strategies not only for Ford but also for other automakers. The increasing costs of developing affordable models and the need to compete in a smaller market may cause structural changes in the industry, which will affect the pace of transportation electrification in the coming years.",https://topgir.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mainstage-keynote-2-copy-1-1024x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 10:59:46.663163

Offshore wind is one of the great UK industrial success stories. In just over a decade, we’ve gone from early adopters to global leaders - driving down costs, increasing deployment, and pushing into new frontiers like floating wind.

But we now face a familiar crossroads. The UK excels at early-stage innovation - the science, the pilots, the policy ambition. What’s missing is often the next step - the industrial follow-through.

If we’re serious about clean growth, resilience, and unlocking regional potential, we need to be just as committed to how we manufacture as we are to how we innovate.

We must make - and manufacture - more in the UK. We cannot continue to rely on others to deliver 50% of our future energy system.

From Policy to Production - The Test for UK Industrial Strategy

The UK’s net zero ambitions are now embedded in multiple government strategies - from the UK Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan to the Offshore Wind Industrial Growth Plan (IGP). Each recognises offshore wind as a pillar of our future energy mix.

The 2024 IGP identified offshore wind as a £25 billion opportunity for the UK economy by 2035, with the potential for over 100,000 new manufacturing jobs. Blades alone could deliver £6 billion in GVA over the next decade.

The challenge - and the opportunity - is to make sure those numbers translate into UK-made products, jobs, and supply chains.

Because without the investment to complete the innovation pathway - all the way through to late-stage R&D and industrial deployment - we don’t just risk losing the economic value.

We risk creating great research for others to commercialise, world-class innovation that delivers someone else’s growth. And that’s the difference between a transient industry - and a long-lived, sovereign manufacturing ecosystem.

Whole-System Thinking - Joining the Dots Across the Energy Transition

Industrialisation doesn’t happen in isolation. To make the energy transition real, we need to think about the whole system - not just how we generate clean energy, but how we turn that energy into products, supply chains, and economic value.

That means investing at every stage - from early R&D, to scaling up new technologies, to building factories and supporting long-term maintenance and operations. It also means making sure decisions are joined up across government departments, across regions, and across sectors - so we’re not solving problems in isolation.

Only by thinking across the full lifecycle - from ideas to infrastructure, and from deployment to long-term capability - can we turn innovation into industrial strength.

Floating Wind - and the Case for UK Manufacturing

Floating offshore wind is the litmus test. Projects are moving towards Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) by 2028. These will shape global supply chains for the next decade.

This is a pivot point - and a chance for the UK to lead in next-generation solutions, if we act now.

The components involved - blades, floating platforms, towers, cable systems - are some of the largest and most complex structures ever manufactured, often made of composites or hybrid materials. Their size makes local manufacture not just an economic argument, but a practical one.

If we want the UK to do more than host turbines - if we want to make the parts, build the platforms, own the capability - then we need to invest now in the skills, facilities, and digital tools that make this possible.

A New Kind of Industrial Strategy – Built on Execution

This is not about rewriting policy. The plans exist. What’s needed now is delivery - turning strategy into investment, and research into real-world production.

Programmes like TURBO, SusWIND , and our work with Vestas are already helping to pull innovation through into manufacturable, certifiable, and circular solutions. Digital twins, automated quality control, and AI-enabled design are reducing costs and compressing timelines.

This is exactly the kind of late-stage, applied innovation that UK industry needs - but it requires continuity, confidence, and coordination to scale. This is about product and technology leadership - not in theory, but in delivery. That’s how we anchor industry and supply chains for the long term.

The UK’s Competitive Advantage - If We Use It

We have the pieces - a strong R&D base, decades of offshore engineering experience, and proven industrial regions that are ready to grow.

The question is whether we can join the dots fast enough to turn that advantage into anchored supply chains, long-term capability, and sovereign resilience.

Final Thought

The next chapter of UK industrial strategy will be judged not by how well we wrote it - but by what we built.

Offshore wind gives us a chance to prove we can still scale innovation into production, and production into prosperity.

If we want clean energy to be a foundation of UK growth - not just decarbonisation - then we must finish what we start - investing in innovation, manufacturing at scale in the UK, and creating the conditions for system-wide leadership.

Because in the end, it’s not just about building wind turbines - it’s about building a future we own in the UK.","https://www.nccuk.com/media/pdkgiupc/energy-hero-offshore-wind.jpeg?rxy=0.9781502175202059,0.6693967239312825&width=1200&height=600&v=1dc313212e585f0",N,,2025-10-02 09:59:07.296474

Policy and legislation changes shaping the current energy landscape will require renewables to adapt. The increasing need for new generation after decades of relatively flat demand growth will also drive changes. The ability of renewable energy stakeholders to provide more timely and cost-effective solutions will keep clean power in the mix, albeit at a slower pace of uptake, at least in the immediate future.

At the same time, the climate will continue to be an existential issue and the United States needs steady jobs and resilient sources of clean energy. We will inevitably have the opportunity to change, reinvent or resurrect tax credits and other public incentives for renewable energy solutions. How should we use lessons learned from both the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act experiences to inform future strategy?

We offer a few thoughts and considerations:

Consider Partnering with Other Energy Markets (e.g., Oil and Gas) to Protect the Concept of Public Support for Public Goods, Including Reliable Energy

An effective partnership with oil and gas players would enable renewables to be viewed as complementary to baseload technologies and an important part of economic and energy security. It would also undercut the argument that renewables are too mature to warrant continued support. If the fossil industry receives financial support, renewables should too. Given that many “big oil” players are already invested in renewable companies, this may be a real possibility.

Consider the Rate at Which Tax Credits are Still Effective But are More Manageable for Budget and Messaging

Tax credits had a much more robust impact in the context of a 35% corporate tax rate. With the current corporate rate at 21% and many corporations unwilling to go lower than an effective tax rate of 15%, the demand for tax credits is not unlimited.

Constrained access to tax investors may be more acutely felt in middle-market deals. The added value and volume of tax investing after the IRA was and is highly concentrated in storage systems, very large installations and manufacturing plants.

Further, the credit adders increase the difficulty of finding budget “pay-fors” at the federal level and may increase unwanted political attention. The domestic content adder seems redundant in the face of FEOC requirements, and it is unclear that any of the “community” adders had the desired impact on communities, in large part due to the time needed to develop sites to the federal requirement and limited bandwidth at the IRS to review applications.

We suggest a smaller credit is more sustainable in the long run. A flat rate of approximately 25% may be a good compromise. It is more in line with other community development credits and would reduce the 10-year outlay for budget discussions while still promoting renewable uptake.

Broaden the Focus for Incentives and Support to More Than Tax Credits

Federal tax credits are but one of the incentives needed to move the market. State-based and regional programs have had great success. Renewable portfolio standards, community solar access, net metering and storage incentive programs are good examples.

The ability to transmit and deliver power is critical to all generating sources. The grid desperately needs investment to address access and reliability. Regional system operators and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should be targets of collective lobbying to encourage progress.

The federal, state and local requirements for construction permitting, interconnection and environmental reviews should be streamlined. Recent changes to the National Environmental Policy Act rules may help. An expansion of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act rules around priority dispatch to encompass installations larger than 5 MW would give some comfort to investors that small and medium deals have sales options for their power into the future.

The renewable community should support state and public utility programs that allow for net metering, protect renewable dispatch, guarantee access to transmission and delivery, and give benefits to low-income households.

In addition, a simplification of the federal accounting treatment for partnership investments would ease a barrier to entry for investors and developers alike. The recent introduction of proportional amortization was intended to help, but arguably made the rules more complex.

Review Experience with Various Tax Investing Structures

The current policy allows a range of investments to monetize renewable credits. This flexibility has proven useful for projects of varying sizes and market segments, each with distinct financing needs. We think the range of options should remain.

The options vary in terms of timing, return and complexity. At one end of the spectrum are sale-leasebacks, wherein the investor buys the entire project for a defined period. Then there are partnerships where ownership is shared and benefits are allocated on a negotiated split and for a defined period of time. The proportional amortization (PAM) option for partnership accounting became possible due to Financial Accounting Standards Board changes. PAM essentially allows the investor to buy into the value of tax credits and depreciation, but not cash, and can be rigid to implement. Finally, the transfer option is a straightforward purchase of the credits only–no cash or depreciation. As you progress through these options, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles accounting gets simpler and returns decline.

Market reactions over the past two years show that simplicity sells, especially at scale. Large investors looking to offset large tax positions trend almost exclusively to transfers, irrespective of lower returns. Investors looking for a more engaged option with higher returns may still invest in individual projects and portfolios of commercial and industrial and community solar through the sale-leaseback or partnership structures. The hybrid or T-flip structure allows for short-term equity (i.e., less than 10 years) to invest and then sell some or all the credits and depreciation. But the hybrid still ultimately relies on investors with tax appetite and may require a complex set of documents.

In summary: To achieve progress on practical, sustainable and effective public incentives for renewable energy, it’s essential to find the right balance of messaging, simplicity, coverage and return potential within an “all-of-the-above” power market.

There are certainly additional strategies and actions worth considering. We encourage all stakeholders to look forward to the future development of the energy market.",https://www.novoco.com/static/images/favicon.4c5b39a4ae2a.ico,N,,2025-10-02 07:58:41.390111

Now what? | MIT Technology Review,Casey Crownhart,,,,,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/02/1124603/ev-tax-credits-end-us/,"The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country.
To anticipate what’s next for the US EV market, we can look to countries like Germany, which have ended similar subsidy programs.
In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales.
And Germany was much further along than the US, with EVs making up 20% of new vehicle sales—twice the American proportion.
According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions.","The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country. And transportation is a major contributor to US climate pollution, with cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes together making up roughly 30% of total greenhouse-gas emissions.

To anticipate what’s next for the US EV market, we can look to countries like Germany, which have ended similar subsidy programs. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably going to be a rough end to the year.)

When you factor in fuel savings, the lifetime cost of an EV can already be lower than that of a gas-powered vehicle today. But EVs can have a higher up-front cost, which is why some governments offer a tax credit or rebate that can help boost adoption for the technology.

In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales. While the program was active, drivers could get grants of up to about €6,000 toward the purchase of a new battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle.

Eventually, the government began pulling back the credits. Support for plug-in hybrids ended in 2022, and commercial buyers lost eligibility in September 2023. Then the entire program came to a screeching halt in December 2023, when the government announced it would be ending the incentives with about one week’s notice.

Monthly sales data shows the fingerprints of those changes. In each case where there’s a contraction of public support, there’s a peak in sales just before a cutback, then a crash after. These short-term effects can be dramatic: There were about half as many battery-electric vehicles sold in Germany in January 2024 than there were in December 2023.

Ultimately, it’s not terribly surprising that there are local effects around these policy changes. “The question is really how long this decline will last, and how slowly any recovery in the growth will be,” Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway who collects EV sales data, said in an email.

When I spoke to experts (including Andrew) for a story last year, several told me that Germany’s subsidies were ending too soon, and that they were concerned about what cutting off support early would mean for the long-term prospects of the technology in the country. And Germany was much further along than the US, with EVs making up 20% of new vehicle sales—twice the American proportion.

EV growth did see a longer-term backslide in Germany after the end of the subsidies. Battery-electric vehicles made up 13.5% of new registrations in 2024, down from 18.5% the year before, and the UK also passed Germany to become Europe’s largest EV market.

Things have improved this year, with sales in the first half beating records set in 2023. But growth would need to pick up significantly for Germany to reach its goal of getting 15 million battery-electric vehicles registered in the country by 2030. As of January 2025, that number was just 1.65 million.

According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions. Sales of battery-electric vehicles could be about 40% lower in 2030 without the credits than what we’d see with them, according to one analysis by Princeton University’s Zero Lab.

Some US states still have their own incentive programs for people looking to buy electric vehicles. But without federal support, the US is likely to continue lagging behind global EV leaders like China.

As Andrew put it: “From a climate perspective, with road transport responsible for almost a quarter of US total emissions, leaving the low-hanging fruit on the tree is a significant setback.”

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies.
Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 33% before the opening bell Wednesday.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high-tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

Energy poverty remains a significant barrier to development, with millions of people across West Africa lacking access to reliable electricity.
The combination of clean energy, agricultural development and industrialisation is expected to generate a virtuous cycle of growth, job creation and improved living standards.","The ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) has announced the approval of more than USD 308 million in new financing to accelerate clean energy, industrial development and sustainable growth across West Africa. The decision was taken at the Bank’s 93rd Ordinary Session, held at its headquarters in Lomé, Togo, on 29 September 2025. The meeting was presided over by Dr George Agyekum Donkor, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who emphasised the Bank’s pivotal role in advancing inclusive growth and deepening regional integration.

Dr Donkor underlined that the newly sanctioned projects reflect EBID’s long-term mandate to strengthen economic diversification and stimulate sustainable development in the ECOWAS region. “Our focus is to provide catalytic financing that enables both public and private sector players to deliver transformative initiatives, building resilience and opportunity across the sub-region,” he said.

The funding package covers four strategic initiatives, spanning renewable energy, agribusiness, industrialisation and trade finance. Each project is designed to unlock new opportunities for economic activity while creating thousands of jobs, improving energy access, enhancing food security and supporting the region’s transition to more sustainable growth models.

Powering growth through energy and agriculture

One of the key facilities approved is a USD 40 million line of credit to Vista Bank Guinea, aimed at bolstering trade-related activities in the country. The funds will support import-export operations and strengthen commercial value chains, particularly in sectors critical to Guinea’s economic base. EBID estimates that approximately 105 enterprises will benefit directly, with significant spill-over effects across supply chains and local communities. The initiative is expected to generate and sustain several thousand direct and indirect jobs, contributing meaningfully to inclusive growth and helping to reduce unemployment, particularly among young people and women.

The largest single project approved during the session is the financing of a 50 MW Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant in Taraba State, Nigeria, with an allocation of USD 98.18 million. This project addresses one of the most pressing constraints to development in the region: access to reliable, affordable and clean electricity. By expanding Nigeria’s renewable energy capacity, the plant will contribute to reducing energy poverty, stimulating inclusive economic activity and promoting environmental sustainability. The project is forecast to provide direct electricity access to around 390,000 individuals, while also improving power reliability for at least 200 public institutions such as schools and hospitals. Beyond the social benefits, the project will create an estimated 400 direct jobs during the construction phase and around 50 permanent operational roles. In addition, between 1,200 and 1,500 indirect jobs are expected to be generated across supply chains, maintenance services and small businesses linked to the plant’s operations.

Agriculture and food security also feature prominently among EBID’s latest approvals. A total of USD 79.219 million has been allocated for the development of a modern rice processing complex and a 10,000-hectare irrigated rice production unit in Taraba State. Nigeria’s ambition to become self-sufficient in staple food production is given a further boost by this project, which aims to significantly enhance local rice output, reduce reliance on imports and improve value addition in the agricultural sector. By combining large-scale cultivation with modern processing facilities, the initiative is expected to strengthen food self-sufficiency, support smallholder farmers and create rural employment, while laying the foundation for a more resilient and competitive agro-industrial sector in Nigeria.

Industrialisation and regional impact

Closely linked to this is the financing of a new industrial park in Taraba State, valued at USD 91.232 million. The park has been conceived as a modern, integrated industrial ecosystem designed to accelerate local industrialisation and promote economic diversification. By attracting investment, nurturing entrepreneurship and enabling the clustering of industries, the facility is expected to stimulate manufacturing, create thousands of jobs and support the development of new value chains in the state. For Nigeria, which has long sought to diversify its economy beyond hydrocarbons, the industrial park represents a significant step towards building a more dynamic and competitive industrial base.

Taken together, the four projects demonstrate EBID’s holistic approach to development financing, with a strong emphasis on sustainable growth, private sector engagement and regional impact. They are also closely aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The rice production and processing complex directly advances SDG 2 on Zero Hunger by boosting food security and reducing dependence on imports. The solar power plant supports SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, while also contributing to SDG 13 on Climate Action by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The industrial park underpins SDG 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, while the Vista Bank line of credit promotes SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth.

For Dr Donkor, these investments are more than just individual projects; they are part of a broader strategy to transform West Africa’s economic trajectory. “Each of these initiatives has been carefully designed to deliver measurable impact across multiple fronts – from reducing poverty and unemployment to addressing climate change and enhancing food security,” he noted. “By aligning our operations with the SDGs, we are ensuring that EBID’s work contributes not only to the prosperity of the region but also to the achievement of global development priorities.”

The financing approvals also reaffirm EBID’s growing role as a key development partner for ECOWAS member states. Since its creation, the Bank has played an instrumental role in funding projects that enhance integration, stimulate trade and improve livelihoods across the region. In recent years, EBID has increasingly prioritised projects with high sustainability credentials, reflecting the global shift towards climate-conscious development finance.

By targeting sectors such as renewable energy and agribusiness, the Bank is helping to address structural challenges that have historically held back the region’s economic transformation. Energy poverty remains a significant barrier to development, with millions of people across West Africa lacking access to reliable electricity. Similarly, food insecurity and dependence on imports continue to expose the region to external shocks, from fluctuating global commodity prices to supply chain disruptions. EBID’s latest approvals directly respond to these challenges by financing home-grown solutions that build resilience and strengthen regional self-sufficiency.

The focus on Taraba State in Nigeria is particularly noteworthy, as it reflects EBID’s commitment to supporting projects that can serve as models for replication across the region. By financing a solar power plant, a rice production complex and an industrial park within the same state, the Bank is creating synergies that could amplify impact and demonstrate how integrated investments can catalyse local transformation. The combination of clean energy, agricultural development and industrialisation is expected to generate a virtuous cycle of growth, job creation and improved living standards.

Looking ahead, EBID’s success will depend not only on its ability to mobilise financing but also on its capacity to ensure effective implementation and long-term sustainability of projects. The Bank’s emphasis on partnerships with both public and private sector actors will be critical in this regard, as will its continued alignment with regional and global development agendas.

As West Africa seeks to navigate the complex challenges of economic diversification, climate change and demographic growth, institutions like EBID are set to play an increasingly important role. The approval of USD 308.631 million at its latest board session underscores the Bank’s ambition to remain at the forefront of the region’s development journey. By investing in projects that combine economic, social and environmental benefits, EBID is helping to lay the foundations for a more prosperous, resilient and sustainable future for the ECOWAS region.",https://african.business/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img-20251001-wa0041.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 05:59:29.572677

“GridFAST’s standardization makes it easier to obtain information, identify the right contacts, and establish early connections with utilities.","The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has launched an online portal designed to help fleet operators and charging providers to interact with the United States’ 3,200 electric utilities. GridFAST encourages early notifications from customers with EV projects to allow utilities to plan for the new loads.

EPRI developed GridFAST in collaboration with utilities, fleet operators and charging providers, to address the challenges related to grid interconnections. Many of these challenges result from utilities’ different processes, tools and regulatory requirements. Planning and integrating new electrical loads on the grid has historically been a multi-year process—considerably longer than the time required to procure new electric cars, buses or trucks.

“For a hundred years, utilities have primarily integrated loads related to buildings, but these loads have long construction timelines, so the grid planning cycle matched those timelines,” said EPRI Senior Technical Executive Watson Collins. “EVs can be procured in a day or in a few months at most, so utility planning efforts need to start earlier than ever before. GridFAST enables customers with future projects to right-size their charging needs, while considering a utility’s existing grid capacity and any EV-related programs they offer.”

“If you are a customer planning sites with EV charging loads, the simplest way to begin an early and secure conversation with the right utility and utility contact, is to use GridFAST as a central portal for collaboration,” said EPRI Director of Transportation Britta Gross. “Enter the earliest information you have about a site, update it over time as details become clearer, and ensure that your project is on the utility’s radar years in advance of your load needing grid interconnection.”

Some of GridFAST’s key features:

Customers can match any project location in the US to the relevant utility and the best point of contact at the utility.

Customers can see EV-related program information across utilities in a standardized format.

Customers can enter preliminary site information for projects many years down the road to inform utilities of future intentions.

Customers need to understand only a single, common utility industry portal intake form to prepare information for a utility’s pre-service request process.

Utilities can use customer site inputs to plan for the aggregate impact of customer loads, instead of addressing one customer load at a time.

Several utilities and charging operators have already signed on to GridFAST’s Guiding Principles, including Ameren, CenterPoint Energy, Con Edison, Consumers Energy, DHL, Great River Energy, IONNA, National Grid, Omaha Public Power District, Pacific Gas & Electric, Pitt Ohio, Portland General Electric, Republic Services, Sacramento Municipal Utility District and Southern California Edison.

NextStar Energy has received an occupancy permit that marks the official end of the construction of its $5-billion battery manufacturing facility in Windsor, Ont.

The plant is a joint venture between Stellantis and LG Energy Solution.

Although minor work is still underway in some areas, the facility is now deemed “fully approved for safe occupancy and ready for production.”

“This achievement is the direct result of a shared vision, effective partnership, and incredible hard work of everyone involved,” says Danies Lee, CEO of NextStar Energy, in a press statement. “As we transition from construction to operations, I am deeply grateful for the collaboration between our partner[s]…and all who have supported our project to be completed safely and on schedule.”

Battery cell production

Construction of the 4.23-million-square-foot complex began in August 2022. The site now includes 11 buildings: two main facilities dedicated to cell and module manufacturing and nine auxiliary buildings, including a recycling centre and safety testing laboratory.

Battery module production officially began at the Windsor facility in October 2024, with imported lithium-ion cells from LG Energy Solution’s plant in Poland.

These modules were assembled into packs that power Stellantis’ electric vehicles.

With construction complete, NextStar says it can now start “ramping up” operations for battery cell manufacturing at the plant later this year.

This will bring the entire process — from electrode production, cell formation and assembly, to module assembly — under one roof for NextStar.

At full capacity, the facility is expected to produce up to 49.5 gigawatt hours annually.

The Windsor plant currently employs over 950 full-time staff, with hiring expected to grow to 2,500 positions as production scales up.

“Completion of construction marks a major milestone for the game-changing NextStar Energy battery manufacturing facility in Windsor,” says Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens.

“This $5-billion investment has placed us at the forefront of electrification. Our collective commitment to collaboration, land development, infrastructure, and job creation continues to drive new investments and build the foundation of future growth and development for Windsor and Essex County.”",https://cms.electricautonomy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nextstar-energy-construction.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 04:59:33.344055

Tesla stock ended the third quarter at $444.72 per share, giving the EV maker a market cap of $1.479 trillion at the end of Q3 2025.

Benchmark’s estimates

Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg noted that he expects Tesla’s deliveries to hit around 442,000 vehicles this Q3, which is under the 448,000-unit consensus but still well above the 384,000 vehicles that the company reported in Q2 2025. According to the analyst, some optimistic estimates for Tesla’s Q3 deliveries are as high as mid-460,000s.

“Tesla is expected to report 3Q25 global production and deliveries on Thursday. We model 442,000 deliveries versus ~448,000 for FactSet consensus with some high-side calls in the mid-460,000s. A solid sequential uptick off 2Q25’s ~384,000, a measured setup into year-end given a choppy incentive/pricing backdrop,” the analyst wrote.

Benchmark is not the only firm that holds an optimistic outlook on Tesla’s Q3 results. Deutsche Bank raised its own delivery forecast to 461,500, while Piper Sandler lifted its price target to $500 following a visit to China to assess market conditions. Cantor Fitzgerald also reiterated an “Overweight” rating and $355 price target for TSLA stock.

Stock momentum meets competitive headwinds

Tesla’s anticipated Q3 results are boosted in part by the impending expiration of the federal EV tax credit in the United States, which analysts believe has encouraged buyers to finalize vehicle purchases sooner, as noted in an Investing.com report.

Tesla shares have surged nearly 30% in September, raising expectations for a strong delivery report. Benchmark warned, however, that some volatility may emerge in the coming quarter.

“With the stock up sharply into the print (roughly ~28-32% in September), its positioning raises the bar for an upside surprise to translate into further near-term strength; we also see risk of volatility if regional mix or ASPs underwhelm. We continue to anticipate policy-driven choppiness after 3Q as certain EV incentives/credits tighten or roll off in select markets, potentially creating 4Q demand air pockets and order-book lumpiness,” the analyst wrote.

Elon Musk has slammed ING Deutschland after the bank confirmed that it was not offering a way for clients to vote in the upcoming 2025 Tesla Annual Shareholders Meeting.

Musk posted his criticism of the firm in a post on social media platform X.

Musk’s criticism

Musk’s criticism of ING Deutschland came as a response to the bank’s comment to a Tesla shareholder. The shareholder, Maximilian Auer, noted that he has not received a response from the German bank’s customer support on how he could vote with his TSLA shares. In response to the Auer’s comment, ING Deutschland confirmed that it does not offer such a service.

“We do not offer the proxy voting process or the transmission of a control number. There is no legal obligation to do so for general meetings under foreign law,” ING Deutschland wrote in its post.

The firm’s reply received a lot of criticism from users on X, with many stating that such comments could drive clients away. Elon Musk later weighed in with some strong words of his own, stating that the bank is effectively denying shareholders the ability to vote. “Denying shareholders the ability to vote, as you are doing, certainly should be a crime,” Musk wrote in a post on X.

Tesla’s annual meeting

Tesla’s upcoming annual meeting this year is particularly important as shareholders are voting on the approval of Elon Musk’s new CEO performance award. The pay package, which could pave the way for Musk to become a trillionaire, is also designed to increase his stake in the electric vehicle maker to 25%. This, Musk stated, should prevent activist shareholder advisory firms to disrupt the company.

Tesla highlighted the importance of this year’s annual meeting in a post on X.

“We pay for outstanding performance – not for promises. In 2018, shareholders approved a groundbreaking CEO Performance Award that delivered extraordinary value. At our Annual Meeting on November 6, Tesla shareholders can vote on a pay-for-performance plan designed to drive our next era of transformational growth and value creation. Seven years ago, Elon Musk had to deliver billions to shareholders – now it’s trillions.

“This plan creates a path for Elon to secure voting rights and will retain him as a leader of the company for many years to come. But as explained below, Elon only receives voting rights after he has delivered economic value to you. Your vote matters. Vote ‘FOR’ Proposal 4!” Tesla wrote in its post on X.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) received a significant boost from Canaccord Genuity this week, with analysts lifting their price target to $490 from $333 and reiterating a “Buy” rating for the electric vehicle maker.

The revised target implies about 10% upside from Tesla’s last close at $443.21.

New vehicle launches

Canaccord’s research across roughly 30 countries pointed to higher delivery volumes than anticipated, breaking the slowdown from earlier this year, as noted in an Investing.com report. Analysts noted that Tesla’s upcoming vehicle launches are expected to sustain sales momentum globally, even as U.S. tax credits phase out after the third quarter. The firm stated that new models will play a central role in broadening the company’s appeal across multiple markets and customer segments.

“On the EV side, we expect more new models soon – as promised by management. These should help global sales momentum – and potentially help alleviate any post-3Q cliff in the U.S. after EV tax credits go away. And these new vehicles should be interesting,” analyst George Gianarikas noted.

The analysts also highlighted Tesla’s progress in autonomous driving. Earlier this month, the company secured approval from Arizona regulators to begin road testing its robotaxi program in the Phoenix metro area. The pilot program includes vehicles equipped with safety drivers, positioning Tesla to advance its ride-hailing ambitions while gathering critical real-world data.

Expanding energy storage demand

In addition to vehicle growth, Canaccord emphasized Tesla’s rapidly expanding energy storage business as a major contributor to future earnings. With utilities and hyperscale data centers increasing adoption of battery storage, Tesla is positioned to benefit from rising demand for grid stability and on-site power solutions. Elon Musk’s xAI has already tapped Tesla energy for its facilities, highlighting broader use cases for Tesla’s energy business.

“In energy storage, we expect an improvement in momentum. We, the world, need more power, and we need more storage for both utilities and data centers. Hyperscaler data centers are looking for power that is not fully tied to the grid: “behind the meter” or distributed generation solutions that supply power directly to an onsite property but are still typically connected to the main utility grid,” the analyst noted.

The analysts also pointed to Musk’s new compensation package, which ties ambitious performance milestones directly to long-term shareholder returns. They view his ongoing leadership and alignment with investor outcomes as key positives, while acknowledging environmental risks tied to large-scale energy projects.

Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) has pushed yet another Wall Street firm to boost its price target, but this time, shares have also held their ‘Buy’ rating, as Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas made both adjustments.

Gianarikas raised Canaccord’s price target on Tesla shares up to $490 from $333, as the stock has been well above the latter number for some time.

Shares are currently trading at around $443, and have not traded at $333 since the beginning of September. Tesla shares have increased by over 34 percent in the past month.

A new note written to investors from Gianarikas breaks down each division of the company and how it will contribute to Tesla’s overall growth through the next several quarters. Investors are certainly concerned about the removal of the $7,500 EV tax credit, but it’s important to note that Tesla is much more than an automotive stock play.

Affordable Models

Gianarikas notes that Canaccord expects higher deliveries this quarter, in part due to the removal of the tax credit, which will occur today.

The firm expects Tesla to offset the loss of the tax credit with the introduction of new, affordable models, something the company has stated it is working on and plans to introduce during the second half of this year.

Now, with just a quarter left in 2025, it seems Tesla plans to launch those models within the next three months. Canaccord said:

“…on the EV side, we expect more new models soon – as promised by management. These should help global sales momentum – and potentially help alleviate any post-3Q cliff in the US after EV tax credits go away. And these new vehicles should be interesting.”

Tesla Energy

The company’s Energy division is one that consistently flies under the radar and gets little attention. With an increase in data centers and the need for more power, Canaccord thinks this is where Tesla could see some true growth over the next few years:

“Fully using grid resources not only takes significant time and effort but is increasingly met with resistance from utilities and consumers as they express concerns about increasing power prices and impact on grid resiliency. Elon Musk himself used behind-the-meter solutions like methane gas turbines and generators in Memphis to build his xAI facility – although next time he should be careful not to pollute the environment when he does it. Energy storage will play a material role in behind-the-meter solutions.”

Elon Musk’s Comp Package

Locking up Musk for the next several years was a crucial part of keeping Tesla as a bullish stock play for many firms.

The new comp plan for CEO Elon Musk will benefit investors as well as the Tesla frontman, and although these tranches are challenging, they appear to be well within the realm of possibility.

“Those targets, if achieved, promise great returns for Tesla shareholders. Embedded in the upcoming shareholder vote is an opportunity for Tesla shareholders to potentially invest in xAI as well. Given Mr. Musk’s singular business achievements, we see his commitment to the company and bold targets as – mostly -a positive. $400B in EBITDA. Yowza. That’s one of Mr. Musk’s operational targets over a 10-year period and compares to ~$15B TTM as of 2Q25. Mr. Musk is who he is, and it is hard to underestimate him. But, a lot needs to go right for him to achieve it.”

Price Target and Rating

Gianarikas says there was a potential for a stock downgrade while mulling what forecast to put on Tesla shares, especially as the firm admits it “still struggles” with the valuation. Near-term, however, there are more catalysts than drawbacks.

With the affordable EVs presumably on the way, as well as plenty of momentum in Robotaxi and Optimus projects, Tesla is sitting in a good spot, especially from an investor perspective, Canaccord believes.

The canceled projects are 223 in total, approved by various agencies from the Department of Energy during the previous administration. Per this one, however, “these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

“On day one, the Energy Department began the critical task of reviewing billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Department of Energy reported that 26% of all the projects canceled were awarded between Election Day, in November 2024, and Inauguration Day, in January this year.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people,” Wright added.

This is not the first project cancellation since the new administration took over. Earlier this year, the DoE canceled another 24 energy projects worth over $3.7 billion in government funding. The list, by the way, included a project proposed by Exxon for the production of low-carbon hydrogen at a petrochemicals facility.

Meanwhile, the government shutdown that began yesterday has paused approvals for new wind and solar projects, although oil and gas leases are still on schedule, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The agency said it would use carryover funds to maintain work on “priority conventional energy projects,” including offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, even as more than 70% of its staff are furloughed.

The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

Geothermal energy generally involves drilling holes deep into the Earth's crust, pumping water into the holes, and allowing the Earth's natural heat to boil the water.
Besides being clean, geothermal energy is renewable, and it can significantly lower energy bills.
Enerdrape's geothermal panels work a little differently from the average geothermal energy project: there's no drilling involved.
Enerdrape is looking to expand its reach into things like installing panels in underground tunnels for large-scale energy generation.","A Swiss startup will soon be bringing its innovative geothermal panel technology to the United States for the first time.

According to Think Geoenergy, Enerdrape will be installing the panels in downtown Chicago's Millennium Parking Garages, which contain over 9,000 parking spaces. The panels harness the Earth's natural geothermal energy and use it to heat and cool buildings.

Geothermal energy generally involves drilling holes deep into the Earth's crust, pumping water into the holes, and allowing the Earth's natural heat to boil the water. That water is pumped up to the surface where the steam spins a turbine and generates energy. The water is then pumped back below the surface to start the process again.

It's a clean form of energy that doesn't create the same planet-overheating pollution as oil, gas, and coal. Besides being clean, geothermal energy is renewable, and it can significantly lower energy bills.

Enerdrape's geothermal panels work a little differently from the average geothermal energy project: there's no drilling involved.

It's a closed-loop system where piping within the panels contains heat transfer fluid that the Earth's warmer underground temperature heats up. That absorbed heat is then transferred to a heat pump that's used to heat or cool a building. It's then sent back to the panels to get heated again.

Geothermal panels like the ones that will be installed in Chicago are already being used in parking garages in France and Switzerland. According to Enerdrape, the company has installed 864 panels so far. They produce 275 megawatt hours of electricity a year and prevent 46 tons of carbon pollution from entering our atmosphere every year.

Besides Chicago, the company is also looking into projects in New York. They mainly involve hotels, housing complexes, and residences.

""At this stage, everything is preliminary, but the situation is promising,"" said Enerdrape co-founder and CTO Alessandro Rotta.

Enerdrape is looking to expand its reach into things like installing panels in underground tunnels for large-scale energy generation. The panels could also be used to power electric charging stations.

As part of the subcontractor team, Harder Mechanical is a nationally recognized contractor dedicated to safety and quality project delivery, while adhering to schedule and budget constraints. Based in Portland, Oregon, the company works primarily in the western U.S. and maintains regional offices in Phoenix, AZ, Richmond, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Reno, NV. Dynalectric San Diego is one of the largest full service electric providers in the region. Their experienced multi-disciplinary team provides design, preconstruction, and construction services for high, medium and low voltage electrical systems. Dynalectric Company has divisions in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington DC and is a wholly owned subsidiary of EMCOR Group, Inc.

The design integration of pre-selected major suppliers will be performed utilizing an integrated project delivery approach starting with a Limited Notice to Proceed, following an Integrated Project Delivery approach leading to a GMP.

The contracting team joins the existing development and engineering consultants working on the project, including development advisors from SOCOTEC Advisory, LLC and the global engineering firm of Black & Veach, which is responsible for independent review of the design and project delivery and target pricing. Additionally, the El Centro-based civil engineering and design firm DuBose Design Group is engaged in the project for site and infrastructure design services.

Located within the Imperial Valley’s vast agricultural basin, Sugar Valley Energy (SVE) is a shovel-ready multi-plant campus consisting of a sugarcane-to-ethanol biorefinery, bioelectrical power plant, and wastewater treatment and biogas production facility. The new campus will supply critically needed infrastructure for the region, excess power, biogas and wastewater treatment capacity for Imperial County communities. SVE also represents an economic boost for Imperial County and the region, with an investment of more than $1 Billion into its development and construction.

SVE will provide a long-term economically sustainable market for approximately 50,000 acres of sugarcane crop to produce the feedstock needed for its planned ethanol production. The project will secure long-term agreements with dozens of area farmers, providing a reliable and profitable crop for participating growers. Highly suited for growth in the Imperial Valley climate, sugarcane has a water requirement like the region’s existing dominant crops.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CEP_Logo2_07c8bed6ec.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 02:58:43.124289

“California’s energy prices are too high thanks to burdensome state and local regulations,” said Representative Gray, whose 13th Congressional District spans the San Joaquin Valley. “The bipartisan HEATS Act would lower energy costs for Valley families and move our country toward energy independence by unleashing geothermal production. I’m proud to work with Rep. Kim to introduce this bill to secure safe, reliable clean energy, create good-paying jobs and drive down prices for the Valley.”

Under current law, the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 requires a federal permit for geothermal activities on certain lands.

The survey, conducted by CRC Research for the 85 Fund, a conservative 501(c)(3) public policy organization, also showed little concern about the safety of nuclear power plants.

Following the 1979 crisis at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, support for nuclear energy plummeted, ending the country’s goal for many more plants. But in the new survey, a majority not only said it is safe but even more backed the conversion of used nuclear waste to power new plants.

At the just-ended Climate Week NYC 2025 conference, sessions talked up nuclear power as a renewable energy source, though the issue continues to divide Democrats and liberals.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) expressed support for nuclear power plants in her state prior to the conference, but did not speak at it. The Democrat has, however, talked with Trump about building out the nuclear power grid in New York, which he supports.

Some pro-nuclear advocates drove a truck around the conference site with a video of Hochul wearing a Trump-esque red hat that read, “Make Nuclear Great Again.”

Polls have shown growing support for nuclear power in recent years. A Gallup survey from last year put support at 56%.

Support could also be jumping because electricity prices are growing, in part to help fuel data centers, especially those built for artificial intelligence advances.

The key highlights in the survey:

— By 69% to 23%, voters support “investing more in developing nuclear energy to meet surging demand to keep energy prices low.”

— By 63% to 22%, voters support “a plan to convert old, used fuel — currently treated as nuclear waste and stored at great expense — to new nuclear energy to affordably power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and millions of American homes.”

Tesla said it would see fewer negative impacts from the changes than other automakers, but it recently hiked lease prices as the credits came to a close.

Tesla bumped lease prices for some vehicles, pushing the Model Y to up to $599 per month for some configurations, a $70 increase. The Model 3 increased by up to $90 for some leases. These changes are likely due to a range of challenges Tesla faces, including a drop in demand, even before the credits stopped.

Tesla’s market share dropped to its lowest point in eight years last month. Data from Cox Automotive showed that the company’s share dropped to 38 percent in the U.S. as buyers shopped electric options from other brands, the number of which have grown rapidly over the last few years.

The tax credits just ended, so there’s no way to know the impact of the change just yet. Some automakers have begun offering in-house incentives and discounts to compensate for the loss of tax incentives, but that effort can’t continue forever. Tesla’s precarious position means it likely can’t manage significant discounts, which may further decrease its standing with buyers.

The program creates clean energy jobs by providing tax incentives to green energy manufacturers.

SB 86 extends the tax incentive program until 2028 and expands it to include fusion energy, a cutting-edge technology that has the potential to produce unlimited amounts of safe, clean power.

“The Trump Administration is eliminating clean energy funding nationwide. With SB 86, California will maintain its lead in the fight against climate change by continuing to incentivize green energy projects and solidify its position as a national trendsetter in fusion energy, which has the potential to supply the nation with unlimited amounts of safe and clean power,” said Sen. McNerney, D-Pleasanton, who is chair of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee.

SB 86, which won unanimous support in the Legislature, will take effect Jan 1. The legislation was sponsored by California State Treasurer Fiona Ma.

SB 86 will extend and expand the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority’s (CAEATFA) Sales and Use Tax Exclusion (STE) Program. Treasurer Ma serves as chair of the CAEAFTA authority.

“As State Treasurer, I am proud that CAEATFA’s sales tax exclusion program is a major driver of green innovation and technology in California,” said Treasurer Ma. “By helping us attract and retain cutting-edge manufacturers in critical industries, it enables the creation of high-paying jobs, boosts the economy, and helps California reach its renewable energy goals. This bill extends the program, expands it eligible uses and continues to allow California access to another tool for economic and community growth. I’m proud to sponsor SB 86.”

The California Legislature established CAEATFA in 2010. Since then, the program has incentivized $11 billion in clean tech and environmental projects in California, funding 256 projects in over 40 counties and creating or retaining 115,000 jobs.

The program funds renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and advanced transportation and manufacturing technologies to reduce air pollution, conserve energy, and promote economic development and jobs. However, the program was set to expire on Jan. 1.

SB 86 extends the program for two years and provide tax incentives for fusion energy technology for the first time. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, located in Sen. McNerney’s district, has been on the leading edge of fusion tech.

,EPA,2025-10-02 03:04:54+00:00,www.nature.com,This US government shutdown is different: what it means for science - Nature,Not Available,,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03192-4,"The first Trump administration (2017–21) featured a 35-day closure, the longest in US history, that cost roughly US$5 billion and led to disruptions across most US science agencies.
The White House did not respond to Nature’s questions about mass layoffs and the shutdown’s effect on science.
Shutdown showdown In March, a small group of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to pass a bill to keep the government open.
At a public protest in Washington DC on 29 September, federal employees spoke out against the actions of the Trump administration.
“American science, the gold-standard and world-leading science and innovation enterprise, is being destroyed,” said Mark Histed, a neuroscientist at the NIH in Bethesda.","The US government shut down at 12:01 a.m. et on 1 October, after lawmakers in Congress failed to agree on a funding bill to keep the government running. Threats of federal shutdowns have become routine in the past decade, but this closure could be different: US President Donald Trump’s administration has encouraged mass firings of federal workers — a group that includes tens of thousands of scientists — during the lapse in funding.

“When you shut it down, you have to do lay-offs. So, we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected,” Trump said on 30 September. It’s not clear when such lay-offs would begin, whether they would survive legal challenges or how extensive they would be. Even without any shutdown-driven lay-offs, the Trump administration projects that it will cut 300,000 people from the roughly 2.4-million-person federal workforce by the end of the year as part of its efforts to downsize the government.

NASA begins mass firings of scientists ahead of Trump team’s deadline

In the meantime, the federal government has stopped non-essential operations. Science-agency staff members have been sent home, their research suspended. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) had planned to halt its in-house basic research and stop admitting new people to the NIH hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. If the shutdown lasts more than a few days, it will directly affect non-government researchers: both the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would stop awarding new grants.

Shutdowns “can have a significant impact on the scientific research enterprise, and a lot of that does depend on how long a shutdown is”, says Joanne Padrón Carney, the chief government-relations officer at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a non-profit organization in Washington DC.

It’s unclear how long the shutdown could last. The first Trump administration (2017–21) featured a 35-day closure, the longest in US history, that cost roughly US$5 billion and led to disruptions across most US science agencies. There is no set date for the parties to meet for negotiations.

The White House did not respond to Nature’s questions about mass layoffs and the shutdown’s effect on science.

Shutdown showdown

In March, a small group of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to pass a bill to keep the government open. But this time, Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns about loss of health-care subsidies and a range of other issues, including attacks on free speech.

‘Scientists will not be silenced’: thousands protest Trump research cuts

Although many scientists worry about the effect of a shutdown, some, including some federal researchers, see this as an opportunity for Congress to derail the Trump team’s activities, which have already included substantial lay-offs, budget cuts and disruption to research.

At a public protest in Washington DC on 29 September, federal employees spoke out against the actions of the Trump administration. “American science, the gold-standard and world-leading science and innovation enterprise, is being destroyed,” said Mark Histed, a neuroscientist at the NIH in Bethesda. “Congress has a rare moment of leverage to check Trump’s executive overreach and it must stand up and do so.”

Drastic reductions

No previous shutdowns carried the threat of mass firings, officially called reductions in force (RIFs). According to guidance issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the office has directed agencies to consider issuing RIF notices to all employees who are working on certain projects: those whose Congressional funding lapsed on 1 October and whose goals are not “consistent with the President’s Priorities.” Carney says that the memo could be used to close programmes, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge at science agencies.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03192-4/d41586-025-03192-4_51514464.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 02:58:39.712528

In 2023, energy consumption in Texas was higher than in any other state for every sector.
In 2023, Texas’s industrial sector alone consumed more energy than all the sectors in California combined, and Texas’s petroleum consumption alone nearly equaled all of California’s energy consumption.
Between 2007 and 2023, Texas’s industrial sector energy use grew 28%, while U.S. total industrial sector energy use declined 3%.
In our State Energy Data System, we convert different energy sources to common units of heat, called British thermal units (Btu).","In 2023, Texas consumed more energy than any other state. Total energy consumption in Texas was twice as much as in California, the second-highest consuming state, and more than three times as much as in Florida, the third-highest consuming state, according to recently released data in our State Energy Data System (SEDS). U.S. total energy use peaked in 2007, and between 2007 and 2023, Texas’s energy consumption increased 21%, while U.S. energy use decreased 5%. According to our SEDS data, most of the energy consumption growth in Texas is attributable to increased industrial activity, population, and electricity demand.

In 2023, energy consumption in Texas was higher than in any other state for every sector. Texas also consumed more coal, natural gas, and petroleum than any other state, and it was second only to California in total renewable energy consumption. In 2023, Texas’s industrial sector alone consumed more energy than all the sectors in California combined, and Texas’s petroleum consumption alone nearly equaled all of California’s energy consumption.

Between 2007 and 2023, Texas’s industrial sector energy use grew 28%, while U.S. total industrial sector energy use declined 3%. The industrial sector, which includes Texas’s energy-intensive chemical manufacturing, oil and natural gas extraction, petroleum refining, and agriculture industries, is the state's largest energy-consuming sector.

Between 2007 and 2023, the population in Texas grew 29%, significantly more than the national average of 12%. Texas’s energy use increased by 18% in the commercial sector, 15% in the transportation sector, and 3% in the residential sector during the same period partly because of the state’s population growth.

Unlike most states, nearly all of Texas’s electricity grid is disconnected from the nation’s regional grid, making Texas largely dependent on its own resources to meet in-state electricity demand. Between 2007 and 2023, Texas’s electric power sector energy consumption increased 6% to help support population growth, while U.S. total electric power demand increased 3% during the same period. We expect electricity demand in Texas to grow rapidly in 2025 and 2026 as data centers and cryptocurrency facilities come online.

By contrast, total energy use declined 14% in California and 2% in Florida between 2007 and 2023 in part because of decreased industrial and electric power sector energy use. During the same period, industrial sector energy consumption decreased by 20% in California partially because of reduced oil and natural gas extraction activities.

The electric power sectors in California and Florida are now more efficient than in the past, mostly because of reduced in-state use of coal to generate electricity. Significantly more coal is needed to produce a kilowatthour of electricity than other sources, such as natural gas, wind, and solar. The electric power sector in California consumed 19% less energy in 2023 than in 2007. In Florida, electric power sector energy consumption decreased 4% over the same period. California significantly increased in-state electricity generation from solar and wind over that period, while Florida increased its generation from natural gas and solar.

In our State Energy Data System, we convert different energy sources to common units of heat, called British thermal units (Btu). We use Btu to compare different types of energy that are not usually directly comparable, such as barrels of petroleum and cubic feet of natural gas.

A big reason for that transition is AI has become the driver of US economic growth and stock market returns.
Yet if there’s a bubble in today’s hot market, Tesla is ‘it’.” A message from Advisor Perspectives and VettaFi: Discover something new!","Tesla Inc. shares climbed 33% in September as investors rallied around Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s renewed focus on the company. That’s drawing attention to whether the key third-quarter sales figures coming later this week will be strong enough to sustain the momentum.

The electric-vehicle maker’s shares notched their best month in almost a year, putting them among the 10 best performers in the S&P 500 Index this month. Even more striking is Tesla’s vertical ascent in the market since hitting a low in early April after President Donald Trump paused his sweeping global tariffs. Since April 8, the stock is up 100%, making it the best performer in the high-flying big tech cohort known as the Magnificent Seven.

The bet on Tesla is that Musk can transform it from a car manufacturer into an artificial intelligence powerhouse that makes robots and self-driving taxis. That goal is reflected in the unprecedented $1 trillion pay package the company’s board proposed for the CEO earlier this month.

But with the stock trading around $445, not far from the all-time high of $479.86 it hit on Dec. 17, the question is what will its sales for this quarter look like — and is the company at a peak in deliveries, at least in the short term.

“Tesla trades at an eye-watering multiple, its earnings are shrinking amid softening EV demand and cutthroat competition, and EV credits are about to expire, further dampening sales,” said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research.

The issues surrounding Tesla’s revenue and outlook are real. Tuesday is the last day car buyers can access tax credits for electric-vehicle purchases because the Trump administration eliminated the incentives. Analysts expect third-quarter EV sales to show a jump across the board after consumers rushed to take advantage of the disappearing discount. From here, however, EV sales are likely to slow considerably, they say.

Leaders within the industry have expressed their own concerns. Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tuesday that US EV sales are likely to be cut in half, dropping from roughly 10% of the market to 5% as a result of Trump’s pro-gas policies.

“Tesla’s core business is worth $150 a share” said Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management and a long-time Tesla investor. “Anything investors pay over that for robotaxis and robots is ‘Elon hyperbole.’”

Buying In

Still, as the rally in Tesla keeps going, Wall Street analysts have started joining in. The stock has received a slew of upgrades and increased price targets recently based on its potential AI prowess. Wedbush’s Dan Ives raised his price target to a street high of $600 from $500 on Friday, saying it is ready for “the next stage of its AI autonomous path.”

Musk has only encouraged this line of thought, saying that the company will soon “feel almost like it is sentient being” on his social media platform X last week. He also thinks 80% of its revenue will ultimately come from AI robots.

“Tesla is the retail investors’ darling,” Tunkel said. “Tesla’s sharp rally has been fueled by these investors’ enthusiasm for its future beyond EVs, as they are envisioning a company that mass-produces robotaxis and humanoid robots, potentially tripling in value along the way.”

Right now investors are buying “more on hope than fundamentals,” Gerber said. “Tesla’s core business has deteriorated fundamentally over the last six months.”

To that point, electric vehicle sales have struggled, and Tesla’s burgeoning autonomous vehicle business is off to a stumbling start. In response, Musk shifted the company’s focus away from its core business and toward its Optimus robots venture.

A big reason for that transition is AI has become the driver of US economic growth and stock market returns. Looking at the Magnificent Seven companies this year, Tesla shares lag AI beneficiaries like Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

Musk’s challenge, however, is that while those rival firms have clear AI operations that are already generating profits, Tesla’s plans are very much a work in progress with little to show so far.

“A dose of skepticism is likely warranted,” said Dave Mazza,, chief executive officer of Roundhill Financial. “But the market is rewarding AI leadership, and Tesla has an early lead in embodied intelligence. Right now, the results matter less than the vision.”

In other words, Tesla’s underperformance means the stock has more room to run if it can legitimately catch the AI wave.

The company has “real momentum behind it” and could break out to a new high since AI has offered investors “a fresh dream to chase,” Mazza said. But it needs to show tangible progress on it’s projects.

So while this week’s sales numbers may provide short-term fuel for Tesla’s rally, it’s the potential for long-term gains, or a reckoning, that has Wall Street on edge.

“Elon is selling a dream, and many retail investors are buying it,” BCA’s Tunkel said. “Can the rally continue? Sure — powered by momentum and FOMO. Yet if there’s a bubble in today’s hot market, Tesla is ‘it’.”

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, has declined comment on his vote to cut $280 million in federal grants to the state – instead focusing on energy dominance, including advancing the Alaska liquid natural gas project.

Sullivan was asked by The Cordova Times on Sept. 26 to comment on criticism of his vote to eliminate $280 million in grants through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to Alaska communities.

“Every administration has its own funding priorities,” said Devyn Shea, Sullivan’s press secretary.

Shea focused on Sullivan’s support of President Donald Trump’s energy agenda, including resource development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and Cook Inlet.

Shea had no comment on the Alaska Democratic Party statement contending that the $280 million in federal grants for Alaska housing and water and sewage systems, as well as flood protection, were canceled due to Sullivan voting to eliminate those funds from the GOP budget bill.

“The Biden administration’s agenda centered on killing America’s and Alaska’s oil and gas sector and using taxpayer dollars to fund projects that sacrificed reliability and affordability,” Shea said. “In contrast, a top Trump administration priority is ‘Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential’ – encapsulated in the president’s day one executive order in order to achieve American energy dominance, a centerpiece of which is advancing the Alaska LNG project.”

Shea said Sullivan supports Trump’s energy agenda and has worked relentlessly to include energy provisions in the budget reconciliation bill, including historic provisions mandating responsible development in ANWR, NPR-A, and Cook Inlet.

“The bill also substantially increases Alaska’s share of future revenues from these federal lands to 70% and helps accelerate the Alaska LNG project – a project that will power much of the state with clean-burning natural gas to generate billions of dollars in new revenues for the state, and create thousands of jobs for hard-working Alaskans,” he said.

Shea added that Sullivan has been working with the EPA on the $100 million recently awarded to the Denali Commission for aging bulk fuel infrastructure.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” said U.S. Senator Alex Padilla. “Walking away from ARCHES threatens the future promise of hydrogen energy and will guarantee energy costs continue to rise for families while the rest of the world surges ahead in its development.

How we got here

The 2022 Scoping Plan identified the need to scale renewable hydrogen 1700x to meet the AB 1279 statewide target to reduce GHG emissions by 85% below 1990 levels and the carbon-neutrality target no later than 2045.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 directed the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to establish at least four hydrogen hubs, including one renewable.

GO-Biz partnered with the University of California (UC), State Building and Construction Trades Council, and Renewables 100 to co-found the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES), an LLC structured as a non-profit purpose-built to compete for and implement a federal hydrogen hub.

ARCHES put out a call for proposals to feed into our statewide application for DOE funding and received over 100 detailed, technical proposals, valued at over $56 billion.

DOE selected ARCHES on October 13th, 2023 to negotiate up to $1.2 billion in federal funding for California’s renewable hydrogen hub.

ARCHES became the first hub to sign a hydrogen hub cooperative agreement with the DOE, on July 17, 2024, the largest such agreement in DOE history.

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy.

The press conference called for bipartisan funding bills that help lower costs and protect our environment and outlined how Congressional Republicans are increasing costs for families, including utility costs, jeopardizing good paying jobs, and threatening programs that protect the health and safety of people and the planet.

“Trump and Republicans need to stop gutting essential services that make life safer, healthier, and cheaper, and instead work together on bipartisan solutions to address the affordability crisis they’ve created,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. “People are facing skyrocketing costs across the board, from health care, to groceries, to energy bills with Trump and Republicans in complete control over the federal government. Yet instead of working with Democrats to make our lives better, they’ve spent this year unlawfully taking back billions of dollars from communities while giving handouts to billionaires.”

“The Trump administration says that it wants to expedite new energy facilities, but that ain’t happening if there aren’t people to process permits and they are also the people who do disaster clean up,” said Representative Sean Casten. “Layered on top of that, the National Flood Insurance program does not have any authorization to operate after yesterday. We now have no National Flood Insurance program if there is a hurricane and FEMA’s disaster relief fund is virtually out of money. The real nightmare scenario right now is what happens if we have another Hurricane Helene or Hurricane Katrina or another East Palestine rail disaster–those disasters where you critically need public servants who are trained, who know how to manage disasters. Whether that’s OSHA employees or the EPA employees or the Surface Transportation Board, those people were either already fired or have been furloughed. This did not have to happen, but it happened because Republicans decided to not negotiate and thought they could steamroll and just get their policy priorities to hurt every American.”

“This president and Republicans who control the House and the Senate got elected promising to lower costs, and from day one they have done everything but,” said Representative Jennifer McClellan. “They have gutted energy efficiency programs that help ensure that your energy costs stay low. The tariffs that have been put in place have caused everything from electric bills to groceries to go up. [Democrats] are fighting for the American people. We are fighting to lower your costs, including your energy costs, your healthcare costs, and to get our federal workers back to work as soon as possible.”

“We’re 13 hours into this Republican shutdown caused by Donald Trump and the capitulating Republicans in the House and the Senate. They’re more focused on giving tax breaks to their billionaire friends than they are extending tax credits for renewable energy projects, including in my home state of Nevada,” said Representative Steven Horsford. “While they’re putting the interests of their billionaires first, we’re putting the interests of the American people and the working people of America first. That includes making sure that we protect and advance a clean energy economy, one that actually addresses the critical needs. Now they want to defund some of the most important programs in the EPA and the Department of Energy that we worked to invest in and to advance, and we can’t let that happen. So let’s continue to do the work now that is necessary as we work to reopen this government, to make sure that we protect those investments, we protect those jobs, and we address the long-term needs of our climate crisis which is real and is growing every single day.”

“We’ve got a Republican party held hostage by a would-be authoritarian and the weakest speaker in history,” said Representative Mike Levin. “That’s why our environmental laws are at risk, that’s why our entire framework that will protect the environment and protect the American people is at risk. All we’re saying is stand up and fight for people’s healthcare — and that’s a fight worth having.”

“In Nevada, utility bills have been going up and up over the last couple of years, and we have heard from many families who are having to make tough decisions about which bills to prioritize,” said Audrey Peral, Program Director at Chispa Nevada. “Now we are in the midst of a government shutdown and are concerned about how this will hurt our economy even more. Combined with the smart energy programs the White House has either cut or threatened to cut, programs that help low-income families pay their gas and electricity bills or move us to less expensive clean energy – like LIHEAP and Solar for All – we have already been hit hard, and we simply can’t afford this. We firmly believe that under any administration, every family deserves access to clean air, clean energy, and a healthy environment.”

“Trump and Congressional Republicans have made it clear that lowering costs is not in the cards for this budget and they are going to let the government shut down because of that,” said Olivia Gries, Michigan LCV intern and graduate student at Western Michigan University. “The Trump administration is forcing outdated and expensive coal plants to remain open while allowing the federal government to shut down. It’s clear where Trump’s priorities are focused. It’s time for Trump and the Republican led Congress to do the job they were elected to do and come to a bipartisan solution to protect their constituents and our environment.”

About Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC)","LANSING, Mich. -- Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced three new high-tech and clean energy investments that Canadian companies are planning to make in Michigan, supporting more than 50 jobs and investing over $2.5 million.

The governor also delivered a speech at the Empire Club of Canada to reinforce the Michigan–Canada economic relationship, one of the largest and most significant cross-border partnerships in the world. The Empire Club of Canada, established in 1903, is a speakers’ forum that has hosted over 3,500 prominent Canadian and international leaders.

“Today, we’ve made the case that Michigan is the best place to invest, even in uncertain global times,” said Governor Whitmer. “From clean energy to advanced manufacturing and mobility, our partnership with Canada remains strong and continues to create good-paying jobs on both sides of the border. I look forward to building on this momentum and strengthening our partnership.”

Today, the governor announced two new high-tech automotive sector investments into Michigan. The Governor, along with company officials at Laserglow and Geotab, announced their intentions to expand in Michigan. These investments highlight Michigan’s strong cross-border economic ties and the state’s success in attracting job-creating investments from Canadian partners.

Laserglow Technologies, a Toronto-based OEM specializing in projected signage and smart hazard awareness systems, is establishing its first U.S. warehouse and assembly facility in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The expansion will create 16 new jobs to support Laserglow's growing U.S. manufacturing and distribution operations. Laserglow’s expansion into Michigan will result in $1,225,000 of private investment and be supported by a $72,000 Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant.

“As our U.S. customer base continues to grow, expanding into Michigan is a natural and necessary step,” said Dimitry Fedorov, CEO of Laserglow Technologies. “Sterling Heights offers strategic access to our key markets, a strong manufacturing ecosystem, and a shared commitment to innovation. This facility strengthens our ability to serve partners with greater speed and proximity, while reinforcing our long-term investment in building safer, more efficient industrial environments across America.”

""The Detroit Region continues to lead the way in advancing Industry 4.0 technologies,"" said Maureen Donohue Krauss, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Partnership. ""Laserglow’s decision to establish their new U.S. headquarters here in Michigan is a prime reflection of that. We’re proud to welcome them to the Detroit Region, and excited to see their cutting-edge products further enhance safety in manufacturing.""

""We're thrilled to see Laserglow chose Macomb County, and more specifically, Sterling Heights for its new U.S. headquarters,"" said Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel. ""The Canadian company clearly saw the value in our region. From our highly skilled workforce to our strong supply chain and network of businesses, Macomb County is the right place for international organizations to land. I'd like to commend our Department of Planning and Economic Development for its role in making this initiative possible. We were able to compete for this project with other states and regions because of our deep connections and relationships that ultimately benefit Laserglow. I look forward to seeing this effort become a reality and I'm proud of the jobs and economic impact it will make.""

“Right on the heels of Rafael Systems Global Sustainment choosing Sterling Heights as its American Headquarters, we are thrilled to welcome Laserglow’s U.S. headquarters to Sterling Heights,"" said Sterling Heights Mayor Michael C. Taylor. ""Their $1.2 million investment is a vote of confidence in our community as well as a reflection of the business-friendly environment and unmatched workforce we’ve built here. Competing against locations in New York, Tennessee, and Texas, Sterling Heights stood out because of our thriving manufacturing industry and the talented people who drive it. Both these businesses choosing our community as their national headquarters is yet another example of how our city continues to be a destination where innovative companies can grow and succeed.”

Geotab USA, Inc., a global leader in connected transportation solutions, announced its intentions to open a new office in Metro Detroit. The Madison Heights facility will serve as a strategic hub for product development and innovation, expected to support 41 new senior and technical jobs initially and $1,560,000 in private investment with state support for the project under consideration to close the deal in Michigan. Geotab’s expansion builds on over two decades of innovation in the U.S. connected vehicle industry and comes as the company celebrates its 25th anniversary and surpasses 5 million connected vehicle subscriptions globally.

“Metro Detroit’s legacy in the automotive industry and its reputation as a hub for transportation transformation make it the perfect location for us to continue building our investment in advanced engineering and leading edge innovation” said Neil Cawse, Founder and CEO of Geotab. “We’re investing in Michigan to be closer to our partners and customers and to tap into the region’s highly skilled workforce. As fleets across the country, and globally, embrace data-driven solutions, we are well positioned to drive the transformation through skilled talent and technology.”

“We’re thrilled to welcome Geotab’s U.S. Engineering Center to the Detroit Region,"" said Maureen Donohue Krauss, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Partnership. ""Their investment reinforces Michigan’s position as a global hub where hardware and software converge to shape the future of transportation. We’re grateful Geotab chose our region to expand their legacy of innovation in the connected vehicle space.”

“Oakland County is delighted to roll out the welcome mat for Geotab’s new engineering support facility in Madison Heights,” said Oakland County Executive David Coulter. “As a global leader in connected vehicle technology and advanced data analytics, Geotab will be a positive addition to the county’s growing mobility industry.”

“Madison Heights is proud to welcome Geotab USA into our local business community,” said Giles Tucker, Community & Economic Development Director of Madison Heights. “Thanks to the MEDC’s Michigan Business Development program, Geotab USA will bring new investment and high-quality jobs and creates opportunities that will benefit our resident and region for years to come.”

Additionally, the governor announced that Charbone, a Montreal-based energy company, plans to establish an electrolyzer facility in Michigan to produce clean hydrogen. Charbone’s planned electrolyzer project will advance clean energy production in Michigan and highlights the attractiveness of Gov. Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan to international investors.

“Charbone Corporation thanks Governor Gretchen Whitmer and her team for the MI Healthy Climate Plan, which makes Michigan a prime location for clean energy businesses and investors. Our company has been planning its first U.S. facility in Michigan and today’s announcement is opening a high-level communication channel and strengthening our relationship with Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Detroit Regional Partnership, paving the way to a successful project. Charbone is confident that its project will create a local momentum, while generating positive and lasting social, environmental, and economic benefits for all Michiganders and local communities” said Dave B. Gagnon, President and CEO of Charbone Corporation.

The Governor was joined by Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) CEO Quentin L. Messer, Jr. and MEDC representatives, who engaged Canadian companies, government and business leaders, and partners across multiple sectors to reinforce the Michigan–Canada economic relationship.

“By continuing to take the state of Michigan’s Make It in Michigan economic development strategy focused on People, Places and Projects on the road globally, Team Michigan is creating opportunity at home by attracting investment from innovative companies from around the world,” said Quentin L. Messer, Jr. “These announcements demonstrate the importance of being present in-market, listening to leaders directly, and ensuring that Michigan’s value proposition remains top of mind. As we conclude this mission, we are proud of the work Team Michigan is doing to strengthen our global reputation, deepen relationships with Canadian partners, and position the state to thrive amid global competition. Work remains; however, this investment mission built undeniable momentum for the future.”

Michigan and Canada have one of the largest bilateral trade relationships in the world, with billions of dollars in goods and services crossing the border every year. The state’s northern neighbor is its top export market, and since 2019, Canadian companies have created 42 projects in Michigan, resulting in $2.75 billion in capital expenditures and creating 7,833 jobs. Automotive projects are the top sector for Canadian investments, with other significant sectors including business services, metals, renewable energy, transportation and warehousing, chemicals, and electronic components.

Governor Whitmer’s announcement builds on previous work across Asia, Europe, and Australia, continuing the administration’s focus on strengthening Michigan’s global reputation as a premier destination for business investment and innovation.

Rick Perry Stake in Fermi America: $540 million","Plenty of billionaires have been created by the artificial intelligence and data center booms—and now, the real estate underneath the data centers is generating ten-figure fortunes, too.

At least three new billionaires joined the three-comma club on Wednesday after Fermi America, an Amarillo, Texas-based real estate investment trust cofounded by former energy secretary and Texas governor Rick Perry, went public on the Nasdaq. The stock opened at $21 and closed 55% higher at $32.53 per share, valuing the nine-month-old firm at $19 billion, despite the fact that it has yet to generate any sales.

The biggest winner is Toby Neugebauer, 54, the firm's president and CEO and one of three cofounders alongside Perry and his son, Griffin Perry. The son of former Texas congressman Randy Neugebauer, he and his family own an estimated 28% stake worth $6 billion as of market close on Wednesday—based on an analysis of a prospectus filed on October 1. A large chunk of that stake is held in trusts for his wife and two children.

Griffin Perry, 42, is the next largest shareholder, with an estimated 11% stake, worth $2.3 billion. Unlike his father, who serves as a director at the firm, the younger Perry doesn’t have a formal role at Fermi. Steven Meisel, 40, an investor in the company through his firm Pencross Energy, is worth $1.8 billion. Rick Perry himself, while not quite a billionaire, owns a stake worth some $540 million. In 2019, Forbes estimated then-energy secretary Perry’s net worth at just $3 million. A spokesperson for Fermi declined to comment.

Fermi, founded in January, hasn’t made a dime—in fact, it lost $6.4 million over its first six months of existence. That’s not surprising given that it doesn’t have any customers yet. In its prospectus, it stated it was “actively targeting” potential clients but didn’t name any of them, instead citing Musk’s xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic as “potential hyperscaler tenants.” The firm claims it signed a letter of intent in September for its first gigawatt of power with an unnamed “investment grade tenant” and pointed to recent data center leasing transactions in the market to estimate that it could generate $1.5 billion in revenues from a lease for 1 gigawatt of capacity. Still, it called these “illustrative returns” rather than projections of its future revenue.

The upstart will have to battle it out with more established data center operators, including giants like Coreweave, which counts among its customers blue-chip firms such as Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI. Coreweave’s stock has more than tripled since the firm went public in March, minting five billionaires and valuing the company at $60 billion.

But investors apparently like Fermi’s business plan, which is centered on a 5,236-acre Amarillo, Texas site called “Project Matador” on which the company aims to eventually deliver as much as 11 gigawatts of energy from natural gas, nuclear and solar plants. Fermi claims it can bring 1.1 gigawatts of that online by the end of 2026 in conjunction with the local utility. All that power will theoretically flow to as-of-yet-undetermined data centers on the same site.

“We believe this rapid power delivery timeline is a critical differentiator that will allow Fermi to attract tenants that require near-term access to large-scale, reliable energy to power their AI data center compute needs,” the prospectus reads. Fermi holds a 99-year lease to the land, which is owned by Texas Tech University.

While Fermi aims to power much of the center with nuclear energy, as well as some solar, it will initially rely on natural gas—similar to other enormous data centers like Elon Musk’s xAI “Colossus” in Memphis, Tennessee. In September, Fermi signed a letter of intent with Siemens Energy to purchase three gas turbines to generate 1.1 gigawatts for the site.

The deal also calls for Fermi and Siemens to collaborate on nuclear steam turbines and integrate them into the four Westinghouse nuclear reactors it plans to build on the site. Perry, 75, who served as U.S. energy secretary between 2017 and 2019 during president Donald Trump’s first term, is a strong proponent of nuclear energy.

“The Chinese are building 22 nuclear reactors today. America has none,” he says in a statement on Fermi’s website. “We’re behind—and it’s all hands on deck. We need to be doing everything in our power to win this race, because this is the race that really matters.”

Fermi’s cofounders believe Trump will help them win that race. The company named the Matador site the “President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus” and Fermi’s website features a clip of Trump signing executive orders. In a press release announcing the Siemens deal, Perry held up Fermi’s data center as an example of Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda.

“No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,"" he said in the statement. Toby Neugebauer was just as congratulatory: “I want to thank President Trump for his strong leadership and action in clearing the path for companies like ours to help America win this race.”

Here are the three billionaires, plus one high-profile centimillionaire, from Fermi’s listing on Wednesday:

Toby Neugebauer & family

Stake in Fermi America: $6 billion

Neugebauer was already in his 30s when his father Randy went to Washington to serve as the representative for Texas’ 19th congressional district in 2003. The NYU alum cofounded Houston-based energy private equity firm Quantum Energy Partners in 1998 and ran it until 2014, investing in the prolific Barnett shale gas formation in Texas. He then cofounded and chaired merchant bank Crestmoor Advisors and worked as a partner at Dallas-based investment firms Dorado Capital Partners and Banzai Capital Group before launching Fermi.

Neugebauer was also the CEO and executive chairman of GloriFi, a short-lived “anti-woke” fintech startup that he launched in January 2021. In November 2021, GloriFi raised $55 million from a roster of Republican billionaires and businesspeople, including biotech investor and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, hedge fund titan Ken Griffin, Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. But the firm shut down a year later and filed for bankruptcy in February 2023. Neugebauer is suing his former partner and his billionaire backers, claiming they sabotaged his startup. (The defendants denied the allegations, and the lawsuit has been stayed in connection with the bankruptcy but remains ongoing.)

Besides his stake in Fermi, Neugebauer is also a part-owner of Major League Soccer’s Austin FC, has a 180-foot yacht named Purpose and owns a 16,000-square-foot estate nicknamed the “White House of Dallas” for being a replica of the presidential mansion.

Griffin Perry

Stake in Fermi America: $2.3 billion

Another political heir who stayed in the private sector, Perry became president of Caddis Energy, an oil and gas investment company, in 2012, then cofounded Grey Rock Investment Partners—which also focused on an energy portfolio—just a year later. Today, the firm manages over $1 billion. In a departure from GOP orthodoxy, Grey Rock says on its website that it looks for opportunities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and “integrate environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) considerations into all of our business decisions.” Perry also serves on the board of publicly traded fossil fuel exploration and production company Granite Ridge Resources and owns shares worth about $6 million.

Steven Meisel

Stake in Fermi America: $1.8 billion

Meisel is a cofounder and managing partner of Dallas-based private equity firm FG1 Capital, which invests in real estate, small businesses and public stocks in Texas and surrounding states. Before joining FG1, the New Orleans native was co-CEO of Discovery Midstream Partners, where he led the development of an oil & gas pipeline project in Colorado that was sold to energy firm Williams Companies for $1.2 billion in 2018. Meisel is also a senior advisor for the Canadian Pension Plan's sustainable energies group and serves on the board of Denver-based energy infrastructure firm Tallgrass Energy. A former investment banker, Meisel also serves on the board of Baylor Scott & White Dallas Foundation, which raises money for the largest non-profit health system in Texas.

While they are gone, they are not forgotten.

Here, we propose a way to connect premium tax credits with health reimbursement arrangements for small businesses that have long struggled to offer health benefits. It would blend the competing health tax proposals—tax-preferred accounts and credits—through changes to qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (QSEHRAs). Created in a 2016 law, QSEHRAs allow small employers to contribute to health insurance Marketplace plans, taking into account premium tax credits. This proposal would harmonize premium tax credits and tax-preferred accounts while maximizing small business workers’ tax benefits and choices. Depending on the proposal’s impact if implemented, modified QSEHRAs could also inform future reform of health subsidies for all employers, large and small.

Historical Tension Between Individual And Employer Group Coverage

Most Americans have employer-sponsored health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) improved employer-sponsored insurance through policies such as banning annual and lifetime limits and setting minimum standards for employer contributions and coverage. It also improved “non-group” or individually purchased private insurance through regulation and the creation of nationwide health insurance Marketplaces: a system of websites, call centers, and systems to enable individuals to compare and enroll in coverage.

The ACA designed Marketplaces to complement, not replace, employer-sponsored insurance. As such, it erected “firewalls” or policy barriers between employer and Marketplace coverage to maintain employer benefits. One firewall is the employer shared responsibility provision (also known as, employer mandate) that fines large employers (with at least 50 full-time employees) that do not offer affordable, minimum value, minimal essential coverage. Another policy prohibits individuals from receiving the Marketplace premium tax credits if the employer plan covers at least 60 percent of average costs and the employee contribution toward employer coverage is “affordable,” defined in 2025 as less than 9.02 percent of household income. The rationale was to minimize disruption of employer coverage and adverse selection: If people at risk of higher health costs shifted from group to individual coverage, individual market premiums would rise for those who rely on the individual market with no affordable alternatives.

Difference In Tax Subsidies

Another reason for the ACA firewalls is the different subsidy structure for employer-sponsored and Marketplace coverage. Generally, the employer contribution for health coverage is excluded from federal income and payroll taxes. Because tax savings depend on an individual’s marginal tax rate, households with higher income typically receive a larger tax benefit from these exclusions than households with lower income, even for the same premiums.

In contrast, Marketplace premium tax credits are progressive: the higher the individual’s income, the lower their tax credit due to the schedule that sets it as a percentage of household income relative to a benchmark plan’s premium. Enhancements passed during the pandemic and extended in 2022 increased the generosity of the tax credits. These legislative changes also removed the upper income eligibility limit on the Marketplace premium tax credit at 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($62,600 for an individual, $128,600 for a family of four), allowing the tax credits to phase out with gains in income. The budget reconciliation law (Public Law 119-21) extends many other tax breaks that expire in 2026, but not these premium tax credit improvements that will lapse in December 2025.

These different tax schemes for employer-sponsored versus Marketplace insurance mean that workers receive dramatically different publicly funded tax benefits depending on whether their employer offers affordable, minimum coverage. For example, in 2022, the average tax benefit for an enrollee with income below 400 percent of poverty was higher in the Marketplace than in employer-sponsored coverage. In contrast, the employer tax break was higher than the average Marketplace tax credit for enrollees with income above 400 percent of poverty, even under the enhanced tax credit.

An employer’s decision to offer health coverage would ideally be made to maximize tax benefits for all workers. However, that would require an understanding of not just the wage distribution of their employees, but other sources of household income, family size, and spousal access to coverage, for example. Moreover, decisions on benefits may be keyed to the most valued and thus highest paid employees who benefit the most from the employer-sponsored coverage tax exclusion. As can be seen in exhibit 1, while 73 percent of enrollees in employer-sponsored insurance have income below 600 percent of poverty and would benefit more from the enhanced premium tax credit, 45 percent of the value of the federal employer tax breaks accrues to the 27 percent of enrollees with higher income.

Shift In Small Business Workers’ Coverage

Since the ACA’s enactment, overall employer coverage has not significantly changed. However, fewer small businesses are offering health coverage. From 2010 to 2023, the percentage of establishments with fewer than 50 workers that offer health benefits declined from 59.5 percent to 52.6 percent, while it stayed the same for medium (50–99 employees) and large (100+ employee) establishments. The coverage offered by small firms has increasingly had higher deductibles and out-of-pocket premiums than that of large firms in large part because they lack negotiating leverage or human resource capacity to aggressively manage health costs. The diminished small group market has put small employers at a disadvantage to large employers in offering health benefits to recruit and retain workers in a competitive job market. At the same time, health coverage of small business and self-employed workers reached record highs primarily because of access to the Marketplace and individual tax credits.

Policy Attempts To Support Small Business Health Coverage

Policy makers have tried to smooth out some of the differences in tax breaks and types of coverage for workers, especially for small businesses. One such attempt was QSEHRAs. QSEHRAs allow small businesses, instead of offering coverage, to contribute to a tax-preferred account for employees to buy coverage through the individual market. The law caps contributions to QSEHRAs at an annual, inflation-adjusted amount. The contribution is subtracted from any premium tax credit the individual receives. The ACA affordability test applies. However, QSEHRA’s design is complex and harms low-income workers. In particular, the full value of the QSEHRA contribution is subtracted from the worker’s tax credit, even though the tax value of the contribution is only a small percentage of that amount. This means a low-income worker gets a lower tax break than if the QSEHRA were not offered at all.

ICHRAs also blend employer contributions with individual market coverage. A 2019 rule allows businesses of any size to fund pre-tax accounts that their employees may use to purchase individual market plans rather than group market coverage. ICHRAs, unlike QSEHRAs, have no limits on which firms can offer them or the amount of the employer contribution. But as with QSEHRAs, if the contribution meets the affordability test, it disqualifies an otherwise eligible worker from premium tax credits that may be more generous for this person. The same holds true in the opposite direction: If ICHRAs are not generous, low-wage workers may receive the premium tax credits, but high-wage workers would get less of a tax break than they would otherwise receive.

Few employers have embraced such options. A 2024 survey of employers found that only 7 percent of firms not otherwise offering health benefits funded some type of health reimbursement arrangement for workers to purchase individual coverage.

Nonetheless, the House-passed version of the budget reconciliation bill would have codified, expanded, incentivized, and renamed ICHRAs as “custom health option and individual care expense” arrangements. These proposals, along with an extension of the enhanced premium tax credits, were excluded from the final version that became the law on July 4, 2025.

A Path Forward: Improving QSEHRAs

Modifying the parameters for QSEHRAs could help small businesses maximize health tax benefits for their workers, which would be particularly important alongside extended enhanced premium tax credits. This could be accomplished with four changes.

First, legislation could eliminate the upper limit on employer contributions to QSEHRAs. The 2024 QSEHRA cap of $6,150 for individual coverage is lower than the average small employer contribution to coverage of $7,947 in 2024. ICHRAs and many other health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) have no upper limit so that this change would eliminate the distinction.

Second, the proposal would eliminate the firewall of the affordability test for workers receiving QSEHRAs. The affordability test is designed to limit workers’ eligibility to premium tax credits—yet, the purpose of QSEHRAs is to allow workers to get tax credits alongside such accounts.

Third, the tax break that workers would get would be the greater of the premium tax credit or the tax exclusion value of the QSEHRA contribution, similar to the structure of alternative minimum tax. Under the proposal, the worker would receive the full amount of the advanced payment of the tax credit for which they are eligible during the year, using the QSEHRA for whatever out-of-pocket premiums they owed and/or qualifying medical expenses. During the tax reconciliation process after the end of the year, the value of the tax credit (if any) would be compared to the tax exclusion value of the employer’s QSEHRA contribution. If the premium tax credit is greater, then the QSEHRA contribution would be taxable, although not counted as income, similar to the way medical expenses before the 7.5 percent deduction are treated. If the QSEHRA tax break is greater, the premium tax credit would be netted against it. (See exhibit 2.)

To illustrate through a hypothetical example, a worker (single household) with roughly $50,000 in annual income gets a QSHERA of $6,000 for a given year. The QSEHRA’s tax benefit, like any employer health benefit contribution, is about $1,300. This worker also qualifies for and receives an advance payment of premium tax credits for Marketplace coverage of $450. In tax filings for that year, the worker gets the maximum tax break of $1,300: $450 coming from the tax credit and the remaining $850 ($1,300 minus $450) from the QSEHRA. The worker cannot claim more than $850 in tax exclusion from the QSEHRA. As a reminder, during the year, the QSEHRA may be used for premiums or cost sharing; after the year, the remainder (or all of it) could be cashed out and taxed as income.

In small businesses offering QSEHRAs, this would allow low-wage workers to fully benefit from the premium tax credits and higher-wage workers who get a relatively low or no tax credit to get the full tax break as though the QSEHRA were an employer contribution to group coverage or ICHRA.

Exhibit 2: Comparison of tax benefits

Source: Authors’ analysis of Department of Treasury, Office of Tax Analysis. Federal tax expenditures for the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums and Marketplace premium tax credit, 2022 [Internet]. Washington (DC): DOT; 2024 Dec 5 [cited 2025 Sep 16]. Note: *If enhanced premium tax credits are extended; zero otherwise.

A fourth change would require the worker to cash out any unused QSEHRA contribution after the year is over. For some people with premium tax credits, some amount of this contribution would be considered income regardless. Rather than have it carried over or accrue in a complicated way, this change would give workers with low health spending in the previous year flexibility in how they use these funds which, ultimately, come from their employer compensation package. For employers, contributions to QSEHRA would remain deductible from business taxes.

Benefits Of Modified QSEHRAs.

The proposal would build on existing policy rather than add another type of tax-preferred account, of which there are many. By limiting it to small businesses, it would test the model for workers who already have less access to employer coverage than those working for large businesses. It would be especially important with an extension of premium tax credits since ICHRAs and other forms of employer contributions would disqualify more workers from higher tax credits.

The modified QSEHRA would give workers who receive them a wider set of health plan choices than they would have if offered small group coverage. Managing their QSEHRA may encourage cost consciousness. And, for workers who have access to spousal coverage, they could either use the QSEHRA for health care copayments, deductibles, or premiums, or cash it out as wages. This addresses the long-standing concern that workers forego wages by declining their employer’s offer of health coverage.

Modified QSEHRAs could further shift workers from the small group to the individual market. Already, more than one in five Marketplace enrollees is a small business worker or entrepreneur. Competition in Marketplaces has also demonstrated that it can lower prices. Additional enrollees, especially if they are young and healthy, could improve the stability of risk pool and lower overall premiums in the individual market, which would also lower the average federal cost of premium tax credits. This proposal would lower the administrative cost of offering health benefits for small employers.

Limitations Of Modified QSEHRAs.

There are limits to this proposal as well. While less so with these changes, the tax benefit of QSEHRAs would remain regressive since the proposal’s benefit would increase with income above 600 percent of poverty. The proposal has no upper limit on the tax break. The uncapped nature of the employer exclusion exacerbates the high cost of health care, although efforts to tackle this should apply across all employer-sponsored health benefits. For high-wage small businesses who have few to no workers eligible for premium tax credits, the modified QSEHRAs are effectively no different than current ICHRAs.

Putting aside the tax issues, employees may prefer fewer, curated choices that are stable across years of group health plans to the multitude of individual plans available in the typical state Marketplace. If enhanced premium tax credits are not extended, the individual market will be less stable and less attractive to employees. If employees disfavor such accounts over a group health offering, even with tax benefit improvements, their small employers would do so as well.

The proposed compromise would also come at a federal budget cost, over and above that of the enhanced premium tax credits and codification of ICHRAs combined. That said, this would be a tax break for small businesses and their workers, giving them a competitive advantage at a time of rising health care costs.

And, it is likely that this proposal’s option for workers to cash out their QSEHRA contribution will affect a small business’s overall compensation package. Employers build into current calculations an assumption that some fraction of workers will decline health benefits. If, instead, all workers take the health contribution since they can cash out unused amounts, the employer may lower other types of compensation to account for this.

Conclusion

This year is a turning point for health insurance Marketplaces. At the start of 2025, Marketplaces had record-high enrollment with strong private insurance competition. This contributed to record-low uninsured rates, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Strong performance also increased interest in ICHRAs as employers have sought more affordable, choice-oriented options for their workers.

Yet, performance will decline with new rules that reduce enrollment; the new law (Public Law 119-21) that constricts eligibility and ease of enrollment and re-enrollment plans with premium tax credits; and congressional failure (to date) to extend the enhanced premium tax credits. In 2026 and beyond, there may be fewer issuers offering health plans, higher premiums, and a decline in interest and enrollment of small business workers as well as employers offering ICHRAs.

There is still time to limit Marketplace erosion and increase stable private health coverage. This could take the form of a compromise. Lending a tax credit and account-based approach to financing private health plans is one such compromise.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies.
Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 33% before the opening bell Wednesday.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

5. Around the State

A recent New York Times article proclaimed that the Democratic Party faces a full-blown “voter registration crisis.”

Similar trends are at play in North Carolina. The Democratic Party dominated politics in the Old North State for the better part of a century, and voter registration patterns reflected this.

But the gap is closing.

As of September 27, Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by a mere 9,968 registered voters. At the current rate of change, Republicans will eclipse Democrats by early 2026, if not sooner.

These trends should alarm the Democratic Party and may indeed signify the “crisis” the Times cited. But it’s premature to make the leap that Democratic pain equals Republican gain in North Carolina, Christopher Cooper writes.

Democrats Are Losing Members in N.C. But Are the Republicans Gaining?

Much has been made of the decline in registered Democrats. But who is benefiting from that shift, and why it’s happening, is more complicated.

Unanimous Decision

The North Carolina Court of Appeals effectively affirmed Tuesday the exoneration of four men convicted as teenagers in the 2002 death of Nathaniel Jones, the grandfather of NBA star Chris Paul.

The unanimous decision means that the two who are still incarcerated could soon walk free, Michael Hewlett reports.

The ruling comes nearly two months after Superior Court Judge Robert Broadie issued a 33-page decision exonerating the men in Jones’ murder. He also dismissed all charges against the men with prejudice, meaning they can’t be re-tried.

Prosecutors have filed an emergency motion asking the state Supreme Court to block the imminent release of the two men.

Appeals Court Affirms Exoneration

After nearly two months, the N.C. Court of Appeals has seemingly made it official—the men convicted as teenagers of killing Nathaniel Jones, NBA star Chris Paul’s grandfather, are exonerated.

Hostile Climate

The state’s first climate deception case unfurled recently in North Carolina Business Court, where attorneys for the town of Carrboro and Duke Energy spent six hours sparring over legal arcana.

The single question they were trying to answer: Should a jury hear a case alleging that Duke Energy is responsible for lying about the link between climate change and extreme weather that has inflicted millions of dollars of property damage on the town?

Lisa Sorg reports for Inside Climate News that Carrboro alleges the utility has funded and promoted a decades-long deception campaign to dismiss the connection between fossil fuels and climate change. Duke Energy says the complaint is baseless and should be dismissed.

New York Climate Week has come and gone, but the renewable energy news keeps rolling along, even here in the US where federal energy policy has taken an abrupt U-turn under President Donald Trump. One way or another, renewable energy stakeholders are keeping themselves busy until January 20, 2029, when President Trump is scheduled to leave office — peacefully one hopes, this time. Some particularly interesting areas of activity have been percolating under the media radar, so let’s catch up.

1. The Renewable Energy Winds Keep Blowing

To be clear, the next US president to occupy the Oval Office may not necessarily embrace the renewable energy transition with open arms, but that’s up to the US electorate. Fingers crossed!

Meanwhile, the US wind industry has suffered a series of setbacks under the current President’s new “American Energy Dominance” policy but some projects continue to slip through the barricades. One area to watch is the wind farm repowering field, where existing wind turbines are replaced or upgraded. In come cases a repowering project can provide the same (or more) generating capacity with fewer turbines.

New onshore wind farms are few and far between these days, but signs of a sea change in state energy policy are brewing in Wisconsin. The state was an epicenter of pushback against wind energy during the Obama administration and its Public Service Commission stopped approving new wind farms in 2011, so it was big news last week when the Wisconsin PSC approved the proposed 118-megawatt Badger Hollow Wind Energy Center, a project of the leading US firm Invenergy.

The offshore wind industry is particularly vulnerable to federal policy-making because it depends almost exclusively on offshore leases issued by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Under Trump’s orders, BOEM has halted new leases and attempted to stop work on projects already deep into the construction phase. However, work still carries on at two threatened projects, Empire Wind in New York and Revolution Wind in Massachusetts. Work is also continuing at the CVOW project Virginia in Virginia, which has somehow mysteriously (or not so mysteriously) avoided interference from the Trump administration so far.

2. Texas Still Attracts Renewable Energy Innovators, Now RNG In Play

Despite the red-hot rhetoric blowing out of the halls of the state legislature, Texas established itself as a renewable energy leader in the US since the early 2000’s, first with wind energy and more recently with solar.

Texas is also looking to add renewable natural gas to its renewables roster. Among other areas of RNG activity around the state, the University of Texas at Austin is hosting the new Hydrogen ProtoHub demonstration and research facility at its J.J. Pickle Research Campus. The program is designed to help clean energy innovators fine tune their systems and scale up for commercial application.

Extracting hydrogen from landfill gas is one of the projects under way at the facility, along with a new all-in-one system that produces hydrogen from a reaction between sunlight and water. Collaborators in the ProtoHub facility include the not-for-profit corporation GTI Energy, which has been assessing how natural gas infrastructure in the Gulf Coast can be repurposed for RNG as well as green hydrogen and synthetic natural gas.

3. Hydropower Taps Self Back In

The US hydropower industry has been all but mothballed for decades, relying on an aging fleet of existing hydropower dams and a handful of pumped storage projects. Still, those pumped storage projects represent one of the few long duration systems in widespread use today. The need for long duration energy storage is rising alongside the renewable energy transition and new demands on the nation’s electricity grid, which means that the pumped storage industry is primed for expansion.

The fresh burst of activity this year includes two pumped storage proposals in Nevada and Wyoming from the firm rPlus Hydro, which first surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar in 2023. As of September those two projects are still working their way through the approval process, along with about a dozen others in the rPlus pumped storage portfolio.

Meanwhile, in New Mexico a multi-partner collaboration aims to fast-track the proposed 1.5-gigawatt Carrizo Four Corners Pumped Storage Hydropower Center Project, which is designed as a model for similar projects elsewhere in the region.

4. Follow The Money: Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers Continue To Step Up

Corporate America has a mixed record on renewable energy, to put it mildly. However, some corporate citizens can give themselves a pat on the back for deploying their purchasing power to push the market for wind and solar energy. Their advocacy was particularly change-making in the early 2000’s, when the cost of wind and solar energy was relatively high.

In 2016 the Renewable Energy Buyers Association launched with the aim of connecting leading corporate energy consumers with more renewables. A shift in focus and a change of name to Clean Energy Buyers Association occurred in 2021 and the organization continues to make the case for corporate action.

Earlier today CEBA released a new report describing how corporate support has smoothed the way for 251 wind and solar projects spanning Texas and two other leading power markets. “Corporate clean energy buyers often enter into long-term contracts with clean energy projects to purchase the future electricity produced for a fixed price,” CEBA noted. “It’s only possible to finance a project if the loan provider knows who will buy the electricity and at what price, so without these contracts, projects won’t get the necessary loans to finance development.”

5. What About All Those Other Renewable Energies?

Of course, wind and solar are not the only renewable energy resources at hand in the US. In fact, the President’s “American Energy Dominance” policy explicitly supports three other forms of renewable energy: biomass, hydropower, and geothermal energy. The Energy Department has also slipped marine energy into the mix, referring to devices that harvest kinetic energy from ocean waves, tides, and currents.

Abundant as they are, none of these renewable energy resources pose a particular threat to fossil energy stakeholders in the power generation field, at least not at the present time. Unlike the wind and solar industries, the biomass, hydro, geothermal, and marine energy industries all face structural roadblocks of one sort or another.

Still, workarounds are emerging. In particular, the pace of technology development is picking up in the geothermal industry, so keep an eye out for new signs of commercial activity in that area.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pumped-storage-hydropower-NMSU.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 22:02:00.593118

Gov. Whitmer Gives Speech on New High-Tech and Clean Energy Investments, Strengthening Partnerships with Canada

LANSING, Mich. -- Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced three new high-tech and clean energy investments that Canadian companies are planning to make in Michigan, supporting more than 50 jobs and investing over $2.5 million.

The governor also delivered a speech at the Empire Club of Canada to reinforce the Michigan–Canada economic relationship, one of the largest and most significant cross-border partnerships in the world. The Empire Club of Canada, established in 1903, is a speakers’ forum that has hosted over 3,500 prominent Canadian and international leaders.

“Today, we’ve made the case that Michigan is the best place to invest, even in uncertain global times,” said Governor Whitmer. “From clean energy to advanced manufacturing and mobility, our partnership with Canada remains strong and continues to create good-paying jobs on both sides of the border. I look forward to building on this momentum and strengthening our partnership.”

Today, the governor announced two new high-tech automotive sector investments into Michigan. The Governor, along with company officials at Laserglow and Geotab, announced their intentions to expand in Michigan. These investments highlight Michigan’s strong cross-border economic ties and the state’s success in attracting job-creating investments from Canadian partners.

Laserglow Technologies, a Toronto-based OEM specializing in projected signage and smart hazard awareness systems, is establishing its first U.S. warehouse and assembly facility in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The expansion will create 16 new jobs to support Laserglow's growing U.S. manufacturing and distribution operations. Laserglow’s expansion into Michigan will result in $1,225,000 of private investment and be supported by a $72,000 Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant.

“As our U.S. customer base continues to grow, expanding into Michigan is a natural and necessary step,” said Dimitry Fedorov, CEO of Laserglow Technologies. “Sterling Heights offers strategic access to our key markets, a strong manufacturing ecosystem, and a shared commitment to innovation. This facility strengthens our ability to serve partners with greater speed and proximity, while reinforcing our long-term investment in building safer, more efficient industrial environments across America.”

""The Detroit Region continues to lead the way in advancing Industry 4.0 technologies,"" said Maureen Donohue Krauss, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Partnership. ""Laserglow’s decision to establish their new U.S. headquarters here in Michigan is a prime reflection of that. We’re proud to welcome them to the Detroit Region, and excited to see their cutting-edge products further enhance safety in manufacturing.""

""We're thrilled to see Laserglow chose Macomb County, and more specifically, Sterling Heights for its new U.S. headquarters,"" said Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel. ""The Canadian company clearly saw the value in our region. From our highly skilled workforce to our strong supply chain and network of businesses, Macomb County is the right place for international organizations to land. I'd like to commend our Department of Planning and Economic Development for its role in making this initiative possible. We were able to compete for this project with other states and regions because of our deep connections and relationships that ultimately benefit Laserglow. I look forward to seeing this effort become a reality and I'm proud of the jobs and economic impact it will make.""

“Right on the heels of Rafael Systems Global Sustainment choosing Sterling Heights as its American Headquarters, we are thrilled to welcome Laserglow’s U.S. headquarters to Sterling Heights,"" said Sterling Heights Mayor Michael C. Taylor. ""Their $1.2 million investment is a vote of confidence in our community as well as a reflection of the business-friendly environment and unmatched workforce we’ve built here. Competing against locations in New York, Tennessee, and Texas, Sterling Heights stood out because of our thriving manufacturing industry and the talented people who drive it. Both these businesses choosing our community as their national headquarters is yet another example of how our city continues to be a destination where innovative companies can grow and succeed.”

Geotab USA, Inc., a global leader in connected transportation solutions, announced its intentions to open a new office in Metro Detroit. The Madison Heights facility will serve as a strategic hub for product development and innovation, expected to support 41 new senior and technical jobs initially and $1,560,000 in private investment with state support for the project under consideration to close the deal in Michigan. Geotab’s expansion builds on over two decades of innovation in the U.S. connected vehicle industry and comes as the company celebrates its 25th anniversary and surpasses 5 million connected vehicle subscriptions globally.

“Metro Detroit’s legacy in the automotive industry and its reputation as a hub for transportation transformation make it the perfect location for us to continue building our investment in advanced engineering and leading edge innovation” said Neil Cawse, Founder and CEO of Geotab. “We’re investing in Michigan to be closer to our partners and customers and to tap into the region’s highly skilled workforce. As fleets across the country, and globally, embrace data-driven solutions, we are well positioned to drive the transformation through skilled talent and technology.”

“We’re thrilled to welcome Geotab’s U.S. Engineering Center to the Detroit Region,"" said Maureen Donohue Krauss, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Partnership. ""Their investment reinforces Michigan’s position as a global hub where hardware and software converge to shape the future of transportation. We’re grateful Geotab chose our region to expand their legacy of innovation in the connected vehicle space.”

“Oakland County is delighted to roll out the welcome mat for Geotab’s new engineering support facility in Madison Heights,” said Oakland County Executive David Coulter. “As a global leader in connected vehicle technology and advanced data analytics, Geotab will be a positive addition to the county’s growing mobility industry.”

“Madison Heights is proud to welcome Geotab USA into our local business community,” said Giles Tucker, Community & Economic Development Director of Madison Heights. “Thanks to the MEDC’s Michigan Business Development program, Geotab USA will bring new investment and high-quality jobs and creates opportunities that will benefit our resident and region for years to come.”

Additionally, the governor announced that Charbone, a Montreal-based energy company, plans to establish an electrolyzer facility in Michigan to produce clean hydrogen. Charbone’s planned electrolyzer project will advance clean energy production in Michigan and highlights the attractiveness of Gov. Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan to international investors.

“Charbone Corporation thanks Governor Gretchen Whitmer and her team for the MI Healthy Climate Plan, which makes Michigan a prime location for clean energy businesses and investors. Our company has been planning its first U.S. facility in Michigan and today’s announcement is opening a high-level communication channel and strengthening our relationship with Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Detroit Regional Partnership, paving the way to a successful project. Charbone is confident that its project will create a local momentum, while generating positive and lasting social, environmental, and economic benefits for all Michiganders and local communities” said Dave B. Gagnon, President and CEO of Charbone Corporation.

The Governor was joined by Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) CEO Quentin L. Messer, Jr. and MEDC representatives, who engaged Canadian companies, government and business leaders, and partners across multiple sectors to reinforce the Michigan–Canada economic relationship.

“By continuing to take the state of Michigan’s Make It in Michigan economic development strategy focused on People, Places and Projects on the road globally, Team Michigan is creating opportunity at home by attracting investment from innovative companies from around the world,” said Quentin L. Messer, Jr. “These announcements demonstrate the importance of being present in-market, listening to leaders directly, and ensuring that Michigan’s value proposition remains top of mind. As we conclude this mission, we are proud of the work Team Michigan is doing to strengthen our global reputation, deepen relationships with Canadian partners, and position the state to thrive amid global competition. Work remains; however, this investment mission built undeniable momentum for the future.”

Michigan and Canada have one of the largest bilateral trade relationships in the world, with billions of dollars in goods and services crossing the border every year. The state’s northern neighbor is its top export market, and since 2019, Canadian companies have created 42 projects in Michigan, resulting in $2.75 billion in capital expenditures and creating 7,833 jobs. Automotive projects are the top sector for Canadian investments, with other significant sectors including business services, metals, renewable energy, transportation and warehousing, chemicals, and electronic components.",https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/-/media/Project/Websites/SOM/Images/Global-SOM/Michigangov-OG-Image.png?rev=04d34972184442b1bd24b5efb46cd150&hash=0235F4FAF19678E6E43C4472A787678F,N,,2025-10-01 23:59:24.140219

BioLabs Pegasus Park is a university and institution-agnostic incubator that offers a level playing ground for life science innovation.
Universities are not only among the residents of the Pegasus Park campus – they also provide resources for research and talent.
“I believe that Pegasus Park is the premier convening space for a life science hub in North Texas.","A life science hub in North Texas offers an inspiring model for how to build a robust community that thrives on healthcare and biotech innovation. In a presentation at INVEST Digital Health, Pegasus Park Executive Director David Snow, PhD, offered an overview of how the Pegasus Park campus has evolved, fueled by Lyda Hill’s vision and supported by an extensive network of collaboration partners across Dallas-Fort Worth.

“Lyda Hill is passionate about two things,” Snow said. “Growing life science companies and building a social impact hub that keeps talent, capital, and innovation here in North Texas.”

One reason innovation hubs are critical is that their intentional design encourages creativity, collaboration, and idea exchange among people working towards shared or similar goals. Their residents offer a wealth of talent with researchers, students, and mentors on demand. It can take years before life science startups are profitable, so shared lab space is essential for lower burn rates. The close proximity of these startups to each other, to collaboration partners, and to investors inevitably leads to partnerships and M&A deals as venture capitalists, angel investors, and seed funders are drawn to these hubs of talent and potential. The reputation of academic institutions, investors, and researchers involved in the life science startups add credibility to these hubs.

Location is critical to any innovation hub. Pegasus Park is strategically located in the heart of Dallas’ rapidly growing Innovation District, adjacent to the Southwestern Medical District; home to UT Southwestern Medical Center, Parkland Health, Children’s Health, and more. The campus is located fewer than four miles from Love Field Airport and less than 15 miles from DFW International Airport. Proximity to resources, talent, and networking opportunities provides critical advantages that reduce risk and accelerate growth.

There are a few components to the 26-acre Pegasus Park campus. The Tower at Pegasus Park houses accelerators and investors, healthcare and higher education offices, life science companies and social impact organizations. Health Wildcatters and Mass Challenge are two accelerators who call Pegasus Park home. Each of them has cultivated a network of investors and mentors who offer guidance to healthcare and life science startup cohorts and alumni.

BioLabs Pegasus Park is a university and institution-agnostic incubator that offers a level playing ground for life science innovation. Opened in 2022, the incubator filled up its shared workspace availability four years ahead of schedule. BioLabs hosts more than 20 life science startups that have access to conference rooms, breakout rooms and shared private wet lab space. The startup members also have access to facilities and equipment valued at more than $5 million. For example, one of its largest partners, Thermo Fisher Scientific, provides state-of-the-art equipment including thermocyclers and a flow cytometer. PHC Corporation provided discounted cold storage and incubation equipment. Millipore sponsored, installed, and continues to maintain a water system, while Elemental Machines provided cold temperature and incubator monitors.

One of the challenges for innovation hubs is how to convince startups to stay put when they have outgrown an incubator. In 2024, Pegasus Park opened BridgeLabs, a space for growth stage life science companies. BridgeLabs includes 135,000 square feet of purpose-built research and development space and is the first institutional-quality lab space in the region. It includes four suites spanning 4,592-6,335 square feet – three of them are currently occupied. BridgeLabs also offers shell spaces for customized build out, maximizing impact and efficiency of the space for each tenant.

Snow noted that the region is home to more than 70 higher education institutions with a 72% graduate retention rate.

“Startups here are more likely to survive, they’re more likely to scale and more likely to exit [successful liquidation event],” Snow said.

Universities are not only among the residents of the Pegasus Park campus – they also provide resources for research and talent. BridgeLab resident University of Texas at Arlington is teaming up with Texas A&M University to launch the National Center for Therapeutics Manufacturing Satellite Campus at Pegasus Park, a biomanufacturing hub. Southern Methodist University Institute for Computation Biosciences, which fosters collaboration between researchers from biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, education, and business for biotech research and development, has offices on the Pegasus Park campus. There is also a place for life science focused federal agencies, such as Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a $2.5 billion federal initiative aimed at accelerating breakthroughs in diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. The ARPA-H Customer Experience Hub found a home at Pegasus Park in 2023.

North Texas has a robust life science ecosystem. Snow pointed out that there are eight major health systems, and seven national healthcare organizations have their headquarters in Dallas. It also has the third-highest concentration of family offices in the country. More than 50 life science companies based there had M&A deals in the past five years, most recently Reata Pharmaceuticals in 2023. This UT Southwestern spinout is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that secured FDA approval for Skyclarys, its drug designed to treat rare neuromuscular disorder Friedreich’s ataxia. Biogen’s buyout of Reata Pharmaceuticals topped $7.3 billion.

“When you invest in companies based in Pegasus Park and in North Texas, you’re not just backing a founder with an idea, you’re backing an environment that reduces risk and amplifies the probability of a stronger return. That means a shorter time to market, faster growth trajectories, and better outcomes,” Snow said. “I believe that Pegasus Park is the premier convening space for a life science hub in North Texas. It’s a place where early stage ventures have the highest odds of success and where your capital can have the greatest impact. So my invitation to you is simple; invest where innovation lives. Invest where the risk is lower, where companies scale faster and where returns are stronger.”",https://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/09/IMG_0490-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 23:00:31.451559

Instead, the future of electrification at Ford might lie in a different direction: hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs).

Ford’s recalibration of its EV strategy reflects not only the challenges faced by the automaker but also the evolving nature of consumer preferences in a rapidly changing automotive landscape. While Ford had originally bet on high-end EVs being the driving force behind its electric future, Farley’s candid remarks show that the reality is much more complicated. Farley emphasized that the company is now focused on adapting to market needs, acknowledging that the EV market will be “way smaller” than the company originally thought.

The High Cost of EVs: A Roadblock for Consumers

Farley’s comments shine a light on a crucial factor that has slowed EV adoption: cost. Despite the promise of a cleaner, more efficient driving experience, consumers are hesitant to spend large sums on electric vehicles, particularly when models are priced upwards of $75,000.

Farley admitted that Ford was “surprised” by this reluctance, noting that while customers find electric vehicles appealing, they are simply not willing to pay the steep prices attached to them. “They definitely surprised us,” Farley said. “Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting; they’re fast, they’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive,” reports CarBuzz.

This revelation is a key moment for Ford, which had initially placed much of its faith in high-priced EVs to lead its electrification efforts. However, Farley’s admission that the market for such vehicles is smaller than anticipated underscores a challenge for the entire automotive industry, where high-end electric models have yet to generate the widespread consumer interest that many had expected. While large EVs may still have a place in the market, it’s clear that they are not the primary solution for mass adoption.

Smaller, More Affordable EVs Gain Traction

In response to the lukewarm reception of larger EVs, Ford is shifting its focus toward smaller, more affordable electric models. According to Farley, these vehicles, ideal for short urban and suburban commutes, do not require the massive batteries found in larger EVs, thus lowering production costs and the final price for consumers.

“What they are interested in,” Farley explained, “are smaller EVs aimed at urban and suburban life where commutes are relatively short. Such vehicles don’t need big batteries compared to large pickup trucks and SUVs, thus lowering the sticker price considerably.”

This move toward smaller, more budget-friendly electric vehicles is in line with what many analysts have predicted about the future of the EV market in the U.S. Farley noted that the EV market is unlikely to grow to the scale Ford had originally envisioned, estimating that it will account for just 5 to 7 percent of new vehicle sales. While he still sees a “vibrant” market for electric vehicles, Farley emphasized that the reality of widespread EV adoption in the U.S. is more limited than originally anticipated.

Ford’s Bet on Hybrids and EREVs

As Ford reorients its electrification strategy, Farley expressed confidence that hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) will play a key role in the company’s future success. Ford is betting that Americans will embrace these partial-electric solutions, which combine the benefits of an internal combustion engine with electric power. “We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-Revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America’s going to fall in love with,” Farley said.

At present, Ford offers hybrid powertrains in models like the Maverick and the F-150, with the F-150 hybrid proving particularly popular. Farley noted that the hybrid version of the F-150 has seen strong sales, despite Ford’s relatively limited hybrid offerings in the U.S. market.

However, the Escape, another hybrid vehicle, is set to end production in 2026, leaving the Maverick and F-150 as the only notable hybrid models in Ford’s U.S. lineup. This limited selection is something Ford aims to change as it pivots toward a more hybrid-focused lineup in the coming years.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ford-F-150-Lightning-Electric-Truck.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 21:00:36.646640

Parker added, “There was an EV market before the IRA and there’s gonna be an EV market after the IRA,” referring to President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which created the now-expired tax credit.
This allows GM to lease the vehicles with the $7,500 credit already included in the price.

The automakers said the discounts are meant to keep EV sales from plunging after a record third quarter. They are also trying to clear existing inventories of electric cars that were ordered before the credit ran out.

Ford and GM are extending the full $7,500 discount on leased EVs that are already on dealer lots or in transit to showrooms. Hyundai is applying the rebate more broadly.

The company is offering $7,500 cash on both purchases and leases of the 2025 Ioniq 5, and it is also cutting the sticker price of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by as much as $9,800, depending on the trim level. All of this is being paid for directly by Hyundai rather than the federal government.

Trump policy changes slow EV market and raise costs

The companies warned that EV sales will slow in the coming months as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls out policies aimed at encouraging gasoline and hybrid models instead of battery-only vehicles.

Automakers are adjusting production plans and preparing to offer more non-electric cars as demand for full battery-electric vehicles cools. Many American buyers are still staying away from EVs because of high prices and unreliable charging networks.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5% from about 10% now,” Jim Farley, the chief executive officer of Ford, said at a conference in Detroit this week. Farley also said the EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

Automakers are already dealing with higher costs as Trump’s new trade deals impose tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. Based on research from Cox Automotive, those tariffs could add $5,500 to the price of an imported vehicle and $1,000 even to U.S.-built cars that use foreign components.

A September forecast from EY, a consulting arm of Ernst & Young Global, showed the U.S. EV market only reaching 11% of new car sales by 2029, up from 8.1% last year. Europe and China are far ahead. EY expects Europe’s EV share to pass 50% by 2032 and China’s to pass 50% by 2033. This gap is shaping how different carmakers approach their product plans.

Hyundai funds rebates as GM locks in federal credits pre-deadline

Hyundai is also retooling its $5.5 billion plant in Savannah, Georgia to build both hybrid and electric models for the U.S. market. “Because of the surge we saw in September, there’s going to be a reset in October, maybe November. But the EV market will settle,” said Randy Parker, Hyundai’s North America chief executive.

Parker added, “There was an EV market before the IRA and there’s gonna be an EV market after the IRA,” referring to President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which created the now-expired tax credit.

Hyundai said it is using its own funds to finance the $7,500 cash rebate on the 2025 Ioniq 5 and the discounts on the 2026 models. Parker said this shows Hyundai’s ability to operate “with a lot of uncertainty.”

GM and Ford are taking a different path. GM Financial placed down payments on about 30,000 EVs before October 1 to secure the tax credit ahead of time. This allows GM to lease the vehicles with the $7,500 credit already included in the price.

Once a lease is written, the Internal Revenue Service reimburses GM Financial. Ford Credit is running a similar plan, saying in a statement it will provide “competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency was already reeling from massive stuff cuts and dramatic shifts in priority and policy. A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America’s health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump’s boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it’s natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA’s furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet’s air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,” Ruckelshaus said. “Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA’s job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. “Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump’s new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,” followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America’s health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency’s shutdown plan

The EPA’s shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren’t funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won’t say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it’s 25% — but the Trump administration’s budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan’s presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency’s shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,” he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,” said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children’s health protection division.

State regulators, elected officials, researchers, private business leaders and nonprofits held the first meeting of the North Carolina Energy Task Force on Tuesday. They discussed how the state will meet rising energy demand while preserving reliability and low rates.

“There are new users in the state that are consuming energy at previously, frankly, unimaginable rates, whether it’s the large-scale manufacturing [...], or it’s the data centers,” Stein said.

Data centers, in particular, drew attention from several experts who presented during the day’s proceedings. Todd Olinsky-Paul, of the Clean Energy State Alliance, emphasized that these projects are difficult to pin down since companies may place bids in multiple states.

Speakers proposed possible solutions to rising demand, such as large load tariffs and shifting energy demand away from peak hours. A recent study from Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment found that utilities can already handle the demand growth from data centers for most of the year without adding new energy generation.

“If you’re thinking about peak shifting, energy storage is going to be a key technology,” Olinsky-Paul said.

Several members emphasized the value of improving grid efficiency. Sen. Julie Mayfield from Buncombe County said this energy challenge might provide an economic development opportunity in a state with a growing clean energy economy.

“Clean energy, renewable technologies [are going to] be the fastest way to meet the short-term load growth that we’re seeing,” Mayfield said.

Matt Abele, CEO of the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association, emphasized the importance of keeping rates low when considering new energy infrastructure.

Without the $7,500 incentive, Jim Farley believes demand for electric vehicles in the United States could collapse, with sales potentially dropping by half. It’s a sobering reminder of how much the credit has shaped America’s shift toward electrification.

Read: Jim Farley – “If We Lose This, We Do Not Have A Future Ford”

Speaking at the automaker’s “Ford Pro Accelerate” event in Detroit, Farley said EVs might soon represent only 5 percent of the overall US car market, a level last seen in 2022 and well below the record 10 to 12 percent share expected this month. That projection paints a far more modest future for electric adoption than many in the industry had anticipated.

A Shrinking Market?

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” Farley said. “We’re going to find out in a month. I wouldn’t be surprised that the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%.”

According to Farley, Ford’s Model e team is continually analyzing the demand for electrified vehicles. The car manufacturer will also have to change plans and decide how it should make use of excess EV capacity and its battery factories.

Adjusting To New Rules

“We’ll fill them, but it will be more stress, because we had a four-year predictable policy,” Farley noted. “Now the policy changed. … We all have to make adjustments, and it’s going to be good for the country, I believe, but it will be one more stress.”

For many years, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has provided transparent and credible public information about climate pollution from some of the largest sources nationwide. It provides the foundational data we need to protect people from climate change and all its ensuing damages – from worsening floods, fires and heat waves, to rising insurance costs – but the Trump EPA has proposed getting rid of it.

Today EPA held a hearing for the public to comment on that proposal. Three EDF staff members testified, including Senior Attorney Edwin LaMair.

“Since its inception a decade and a half ago, the [Greenhouse Gas] Reporting Program has provided comprehensive information that is foundational to effective climate policy and the protection of public health and welfare … its data underpin[s] key EPA policies – including standards for power plants, oil and gas facilities, and landfills,” said LaMair in his testimony. “Eliminating or delaying reporting would obscure pollution from public view, eroding confidence in emissions reductions ... We strongly oppose EPA’s proposal.”

This is not the first time the Trump EPA has attacked the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Earlier this year, Administrator Lee Zeldin shut down the program’s reporting portal for over a month without explanation and then unlawfully tried to delay the deadlines for companies to report their climate pollution. EDF filed a lawsuit challenging those actions. The Trump administration also refused to release this year’s U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory – an annual accounting of pollution that uses Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data. EDF got those documents through the Freedom of Information Act and made them publicly available on our website.

And stop pretending that Sable Offshore is the problem when we are directly supporting the destruction of the Amazon in its place.","California’s refusal to permit a simple onshore pipeline for the Sable offshore oil project has morphed into an absurd spectacle.

Instead of a straightforward, cost-effective inland connection, operators are now forced to consider a Floating Production Storage and Offloading unit (an FPSO) to process and shuttle crude at sea. This detour exemplifies the empty promise of NIMBYism: campaigning to “protect” the environment at home while outsourcing real destruction and real costs to distant places.

Gas prices here tell the story. Californians pay 70 percent more for gas than people in Texas.

Meanwhile, four major California refineries are shuttering, which will make that multiple go even higher. It’s been stated by some experts if things don’t change, Californians will be paying north of $6/gallon.

Here’s the kicker: the most climate-friendly, lowest-carbon oil available to Californians sits right off our coast. Every barrel from the Sable project is produced under the world’s toughest safety and environmental standards, continuous emissions monitoring, rigorous spill-prevention plans, and top-tier worker training. Yet local resistance to a land-based pipeline scuttles this option. The result? We choke off our own responsibly produced fuel and double down on imports that devastate rainforests and imperil communities.

Meanwhile, Ecuador supplies a large share of our imported crude, and the toll on the Amazon is staggering. Since the 1970s, oil development in Ecuador has wiped out more than 1.6 million acres of primary rainforest for drilling sites, roads, and support facilities.

Just within a 30-mile radius of the Lago Agrio fields, where a significant portion of our imports originates, over 370,000 acres of intact forest have vanished in the past two decades. These forests aren’t just trees; they’re irreplaceable carbon sinks, biodiversity hotspots, and the ancestral lands of Indigenous peoples.

It’s been stated that California is responsible for 50 percent of the oil related deforestation in Ecuador as the largest single importer of Rainforest oil. Oil-driven deforestation releases massive CO₂ emissions, fragments wildlife habitat, and leaves toxic legacies. Yet, we ignore this information and are trying to block a source of oil that causes none of the above.

Add in the fact the rest of the oil that is imported comes from other countries such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE which all have terrible human rights issues.

From an energy security perspective, domestic production is a no-brainer. It shields us from global supply shocks, price spikes triggered by geopolitical events, and natural disasters that can knock out foreign production. Yet by refusing to build Sable’s Oil, which is already drilled and ready to go, we surrender that stability in favor of riskier, dirtier, and more expensive imports.

The path forward is clear: Ditch the politics, embrace the pragmatism.

What the 2026 and 2028 Elections Mean for Clean Energy Clean energy will likely be a major issue in the 2026 midterm elections, in which Republicans will be defending narrow margins in both the House and Senate.

Consider joining the Novogradac Renewable Energy Working Group to stay up to date and ensure your voice is heard in shaping clean energy tax credits and attending the Novogradac 2025 Fall Renewable Energy Tax Credits Conference, Nov. 6-7 in Washington, D.C. to learn more.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law July 4, is reshaping the topography of federal community development tax incentives by boosting affordable housing and community development incentives while dealing a sharp blow to clean energy.

On one hand, the OBBBA expanded the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) and made permanent both opportunity zones (OZ) and new markets tax credits (NMTC). On the other, the OBBBA accelerated expiration dates for many clean energy tax credits that were either created or enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and greatly expanded foreign entities of concern (FEOC) restrictions. Navigating the new FEOC rules, which generally takes effect Jan. 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers, poses a major challenge for developers who have relied on components for clean energy facilities made by companies with ties to a “covered nation,” or are based in or involved with companies based in one of these nations, a list that includes China.

Through an executive order issued July 7, President Donald Trump directed Treasury to take prompt action to strictly enforce the termination of the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for wind and solar facilities within 45 days, including issuing beginning of construction (BOC) guidance. In response, on Aug. 15, the Internal Revenue Service issued Notice 2025-42 that prospectively narrows the BOC definition for solar and wind projects and limits the availability of prior rules. The announcement was better than many feared after President Trump’s executive order.

The pivot in direction following the passage of the IRA, which widely expanded clean energy tax subsidies, to the narrowing and repeals contained in OBBBA highlights the dramatic effect elections can have on tax policy. Depending on the outcomes of the 2026 midterm and 2028 presidential elections, the United States could either continue with a pared-back approach to renewable energy incentives or abruptly reverse course and once again expand clean energy incentives.

Key Provisions of the OBBBA

Surviving Technologies

The OBBBA wasn’t bad news for all clean energy technologies, as several non-solar/wind technologies survived relatively unscathed or were even mildly enhanced. For example, energy storage, geothermal, hydro, biogas and renewable and natural gas were relatively unscathed. Fuel cell property was given eligibility under IRC Section 48E, regardless of emissions. The nuclear power PTC was given a three-step phasedown after the previous expiration date and the clean fuel PTC was extended by two years to 2029. The legislation retains the transferability and elective pay provisions used to monetize clean energy tax credits. One change, however, was that energy credits cannot be transferred to a specified foreign entity (SFE) under the new

FEOC restrictions.

Incentives Facing Accelerated Expiration

The harshest news from the OBBBA came with early sunset dates for clean energy incentives for automobiles, homes and commercial buildings. Vehicle acquisition credits under Sections 30D, 25E and 45W expired Sept. 30, 2025. For owner-occupied homes, credits for residential clean energy property (Section 25D) and energy-efficient improvements (Section 25C) remain available through Dec. 31, 2025. Meanwhile, credits for vehicle refueling infrastructure (Section 30C) and commercial buildings and new homes (Sections 179D and 45L) are set to expire June 30, 2026.

Solar and Wind Facilities

Under OBBBA, to qualify for the investment and production tax credits, solar and wind facilities must generally be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027. However, under a transition rule, projects that begin construction by July 4, 2026, retain eligibility for these clean energy tax incentives if placed in service by the end of the calendar year four years later. This transition rule highlights the importance of the definition of BOC, as modified by IRS

Notice 2025-42.

First, the revised rules contained in Notice 2025-42 do not apply to properties that began construction (as determined under prior guidance) before Sept. 2, 2025. Those properties may continue to rely on the more liberal prior BOC guidance.

For all other solar and wind facilities that begin construction on or after Sept. 2, 2025, the 5% safe harbor is now limited to solar systems that are 1.5MW or less. This means the physical work test is the sole BOC test for most facilities that began construction on or after Sept. 2, 2025.

Under the physical work test a taxpayer must “maintain a continuous program of construction.” A safe harbor exists where the continuity requirement is deemed to be satisfied by placing an applicable wind or solar facility in service by the end of the fourth calendar year after the calendar year in which construction began. For example, if construction began on Aug. 20, 2025, the wind or solar facility is deemed to satisfy the continuity requirement if it is placed in service by Dec. 31, 2029.

The 5% safe harbor test had been available to determine BOC for investment and production tax credit eligibility since 2013. The 5% safe harbor is now available only for low-output solar facilities, which are properties with nameplate capacity of no more than 1.5 megawatts (MW) alternating current (AC). Two or more solar facilities with integrated operations must aggregate their capacities for this test, making it more difficult to stay under the 1.5 MW limit. (Note: Most apartment buildings with solar panels fall well below the 1.5 MW standard, often featuring only about 10% of that nameplate capacity. That means they can generally still use the 5% safe harbor.)

Notice 2025-42 provides additional guidance on the physical work test. The notice largely retains existing standards, requiring that physical work of a significant nature be performed, and focuses on the nature of the work performed, not the amount or the cost. There is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required. Examples of what constitutes “significant physical work” are included in the notice.

Qualifying Physical Work and Continuity Requirements

For wind properties, “significant physical work” includes such on-site work as excavation for foundations, setting anchor bolts, pouring concrete pads and the on-site assembly of turbines and tower units. For solar properties, it includes the installation of racking or other structures to affix to the site panels, collectors or solar cells. For both wind and solar, qualifying off-site physical work includes the manufacturing of custom components that would not be held in inventory, including such things as transformers, inverters, racking and mounting equipment.

As noted above, the guidance confirmed that work must be continuous and provided two paths to qualify:

place the project in service within four calendar years after the calendar year BOC was met, or

if the project is placed in service beyond the four-year window, be able to somehow substantiate continuous work. Certain excusable disruptions include specific weather events, natural disasters and permitting delays.

Other Eligibility Timelines and Strategic Planning

For other technologies that qualify for the tech-neutral PTC or ITC–such as battery storage–there was more grace in the OBBBA. The current credit amounts will generally remain for those technologies that begin construction through 2033, dropping to 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035 and then going away beginning in 2036.

The obvious takeaway from the OBBBA and the BOC guidance is that wind and solar developers should start construction as soon as possible on as many facilities as is feasible within the parameters of the existing guidance. More specifically, begin construction by Dec. 31, 2025, to generally avoid the new material assistance FEOC rules and by July 4, 2026, to avoid the Dec. 31, 2027, placed-in-service deadline.

As issues arise in applying the BOC standards, additional guidance from the IRS could be forthcoming. Clean energy developers should also remember that the 5% safe harbor is provided for in Treasury guidance, not the statute, which means Treasury could further limit its availability for other technologies.

FEOC Considerations: Compliance Challenges Ahead

Treasury has yet to address FEOC, but such guidance is expected before the end of the year. Stakeholders expect challenges in meeting FEOC requirements, since so many components are made by companies with ties to China.

The OBBBA prohibits taxpayers from receiving “material assistance” from prohibited foreign entities. The definition of material assistance establishes initial minimum non-FEOC cost percentages. These minimum percentages vary based on technology and components and increase annually for most starting in 2026.

Taxpayers will need to document compliance with FEOC rules, including the minimum non-FEOC cost ratios. Documenting such compliance will be time consuming and expensive. (Novogradac is developing a service line to assist clients with that challenge, similar to documenting compliance with domestic content criteria.)

As clean energy developers seek components from manufacturers without ties to FEOC and compliant producers increase output, manufacturers with disqualifying foreign ties, particularly those supplying solar and wind projects, will face growing demand shortages.

Remaining Questions, Anticipated Guidance

The upcoming Treasury FEOC guidance is expected to include how entities will be identified and treated as prohibited foreign entities (PFEs) establish rules to prevent foreign-influenced entity (FIE) circumvention, provide guidance on preventing circumvention through contracts or licensing arrangements, clarify treatment of foreign-controlled entities and further define “effective control” and “material assistance,” including what constitutes BOC for the Dec. 31, 2025, deadline.

Treasury must also provide safe harbor tables and guidance to identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or the direct material cost of eligible components attributable to a PFE, with rules to determine the amount of material assistance from a PFE. It will additionally need to issue regulations to prevent circumvention of the guidelines through stockpiling products, components or subcomponents of eligible components during the period before the application of the material assistance requirements.

What the 2026 and 2028 Elections Mean for Clean Energy

Clean energy will likely be a major issue in the 2026 midterm elections, in which Republicans will be defending narrow margins in both the House and Senate. If Republicans continue to hold the House and Senate (Trump’s presidency isn’t scheduled to end until Jan. 20, 2029), there may be further reconciliation legislation that could more aggressively roll back the remaining clean energy tax incentives. If Democrats take control of either the House or the Senate, or both, the accelerated expiration dates of some clean energy tax credits could be reversed. In 2028, voters will elect the next president, as well as determine control of both chambers of Congress. The results of this election will most certainly determine the longer-term future of clean energy tax credits.

During the interim, clean energy stakeholders should actively communicate to members of Congress, Treasury and the IRS the impact of existing guidance and how future regulations can be most effective. Consider joining the Novogradac Renewable Energy Working Group to stay up to date and ensure your voice is heard in shaping clean energy tax credits and attending the Novogradac 2025 Fall Renewable Energy Tax Credits Conference, Nov. 6-7 in Washington, D.C. to learn more.

The clean energy sector is at a crossroads. The OBBBA and subsequent guidance underscore the urgency for developers and investors to act swiftly and strategically with the evolving regulatory terrain.

The company announced Tuesday it has received its occupancy permit from the City of Windsor, and while minor construction activities continue in non-operational areas, the facility is fully approved for safe occupancy, bringing the company a step closer to increasing operations at its cell manufacturing facility this year.

Chief Operating Officer Brett Hillock says there's a level of excitement to get to work on the actual product.

""It's kind of like being handed over the keys to your new car,"" he says. The team is very excited about getting hands-on with the processes, working through our procedures, and getting to work on the actual product, so there's a lot of excitement in the air.""

The site just off the E.C. Row Expressway and Banwell Road is home to two main manufacturing facilities-the Cell and Module-and nine support buildings, including a recycling centre and safety testing laboratory.

Hillock says they are now able to fine-tune their processes with their test material.

""Once we prove out our processes, we move into our sample phases, which will go into full validation. When we receive our validation and certification of our material, then we can move over into mass production,"" he says.

Hillock says they're looking to begin mass production by the end of the year.

The facility is capable of an annual production capacity of up to 49.5 gigawatt hours.

Core operations include electrode production, cell formation and assembly, and module assembly.

Over 950 full-time employees have been hired to date, and the company is committed to creating 2,500 local jobs.

Construction of the massive 4.23 million-square-foot joint venture began in 2022.

Although the U.S. has been the world’s leading producer of crude oil and natural gas for several years running, Trump campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill.” For years, Trump has labeled climate change a “hoax” and has attacked plans to address climate change as wasteful.

Likewise, Project 2025 repeatedly called for an end to former President Joe Biden’s “war on fossil fuels.” The document accused Biden of denying Americans “cheaper and more abundant energy,” while wasting “hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies” on “unreliable renewables.”

There is scant mention in Project 2025 of the threats posed by climate change.

“You don’t see a concern for sea levels rising. You don’t see a concern for more frequent extreme weather. You don’t see any discussion of the catastrophic flooding that we’re seeing around the world. You don’t see any discussion of rising global temperatures,” David Graham, author of “The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America,” told NPR. “Instead, what you see is an argument that the U.S. is not doing enough to drill oil and gas.”

As he did in his first term, Trump has taken steps to withdraw from international climate agreements and rollback regulations, while moving to increase fossil fuel production on federal lands and waters.

But in his return to the White House, Trump has gone way beyond what he did in his first term. He has declared a national energy emergency, rescinded funding for green energy projects, and quickly moved to eliminate climate research and climate-focused offices and programs.

Perhaps symbolic of his second term, Trump is seeking to rescind the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and safety.

As we’ve written, the Obama-era endangerment finding is the legal foundation that allows the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles — that cause climate change. At the same time, the Trump administration is seeking to rollback new fuel economy standards that were adopted last year.

Project 2025 called on the EPA “to update the 2009 endangerment finding” and for the emissions standards to be repealed.

“It is not an overstatement to say that the Trump administration has launched the worst White House assault in history on the environment and public health,” Manish Bapna, the president and CEO of the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, told Inside Climate News. “If this assault succeeds, it could take a generation or more to repair the damage.”

The Republican-controlled Congress has gone along with much of the administration’s actions, but it has pushed back on some of Trump’s efforts to defund scientific research.

The state officials specifically criticize how the tech companies buy clean energy.
The attorneys general said companies don’t actually use that energy, and this doesn't make them “powered by” renewables.
The attorneys general also claim the tech companies are pushing utilities toward “harmful net-zero goals,” and this has led to coal and gas plants shutting their doors.
In addition to Montana and Wyoming, the attorneys general who sent the letter represent Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia.","Attorneys general in Wyoming, Montana and 14 other conservative states are alleging big-name tech companies are misleading consumers about their support for green energy.

In a letter to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft dated Sept. 24, the attorneys general accused them of using “environmental accounting gimmicks” to say they’re powered by renewables.

“These claims appear deceptive given the increasing electricity demands of those companies and the realities of the U.S. electrical grid,” the letter says, before requesting the companies answer a series of questions about their energy use, policies and claims.

The state officials specifically criticize how the tech companies buy clean energy.

“The attorney generals are questioning the longstanding way we've done things,” said John Rogers, associate director of energy analytics at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Rogers said companies don’t always have control over where utilities get power. So, they may buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) from solar or wind farms to be more green and offset their energy use.

The attorneys general said companies don’t actually use that energy, and this doesn't make them “powered by” renewables. A spokesperson from Amazon said this reliance on RECs is temporary.

“Amazon purchases RECs as a temporary bridging mechanism while we wait for renewable energy projects to come online,” the spokesperson wrote via email.

Rogers said buying RECs fuels more demand for renewables.

“You can be forcing action elsewhere in the market,” he explained.

The attorneys general also claim the tech companies are pushing utilities toward “harmful net-zero goals,” and this has led to coal and gas plants shutting their doors.

“These utility commitments have helped contribute to the phenomenon of early retirement of coal and natural gas plants, which is raising state concerns and threatening the integrity of the electric grid,” the letter reads.

The attorneys general also say that this threatens President Donald Trump’s efforts to “unleash American energy.""

Rogers said these points may suggest the state officials have ulterior motives.

“Their interest may not be entirely about ensuring the integrity of renewable energy markets and more about propping up fossil fuels,” he said.

The letter asks companies to respond to Montana’s Officer of Consumer Protection by Oct. 27.

The spokesperson from Amazon said the company has received the letter and is reviewing it. A representative for Microsoft said no comment. Google and Meta did not respond by deadline.

Why it matters: The $7,500 tax credit was a significant incentive for qualifying buyers, but President Trump and congressional Republicans recently killed it.

""As expected, the end of the EV tax credit has caused a pull-forward in demand, but it has been stronger than we originally estimated,"" Dorsheimer said in a research note.
Threat level: Tesla isn't the only automaker expected to take a hit from the end of the EV tax credits.","Tesla is hiking lease prices as automakers adjust to the new normal with no federal tax credits to drive sales of electric vehicles.

Why it matters: The $7,500 tax credit was a significant incentive for qualifying buyers, but President Trump and congressional Republicans recently killed it.

Between the lines: Tesla factored federal discounts into its lease pricing for all of its models. Now that those discounts are gone, the company's hiking those prices to make up the difference, explains Kelley Blue Book.

The Model Y lease goes from a range of $479 to $529 to a range of $529 and $599, while the Model 3 goes from $349 to $699 to a range of $429 and $759, Reuters notes, citing a review of Tesla's website.

The intrigue: Tesla likely enjoyed a significant increase in demand late in the third quarter as consumers sought to get ahead of the tax credit's demise, according to William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer.

""As expected, the end of the EV tax credit has caused a pull-forward in demand, but it has been stronger than we originally estimated,"" Dorsheimer said in a research note.

Consensus estimates call for Tesla to report 443,000 EV deliveries when it releases its quarterly figures on Thursday, according to Dorsheimer.

Threat level: Tesla isn't the only automaker expected to take a hit from the end of the EV tax credits.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tuesday that he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if EV market share goes from a range of 10% to 12% in September to 5%, CNBC reported.

""I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,"" he said.

Hyundai Motor, meanwhile, is reportedly not ready to test the new EV economics. It's reducing the sticker price of its 2026 Ioniq 5 compact crossover models by up to $9,800, and continuing to offer customers a $7,500 cash incentive for 2025 models through October, per Automotive News.

Yes, but: Tesla investors don't seem too concerned as they focus on the company's roadmap to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

""The market has looked through our concerns,"" Dorsheimer wrote, as ""momentum from robotaxi, Elon Musk's stock purchase and new energy storage products have pushed the stock to near all-time highs.""",https://images.axios.com/m13lZ9tKIjHo_MIUaBN1vYi8ZxM=/0x220:6000x3595/1366x768/2025/10/01/1759345724038.jpeg,N,,2025-10-01 18:01:34.065455

According to RWE, the volume is equivalent to the annual consumption of around 140 Co-op food stores or 12,200 homes.

“This contract will help Co-op to meet an increasing proportion of its energy needs from renewable sources,” said Olaf Lubenow, head of commodity solutions UK, north and south Europe at RWE Supply & Trading.

Heather Thomas, group property and sustainability director at Co-op, said: “At Co-op, we’re delighted to announce this further power purchase agreement signing, as we continue to strengthen our energy purchasing strategy by making impactful changes across our business.

“For the sake of people and planet, it’s vital that collectively we tackle the climate crisis. The energy transition is central to energy security and therefore national security too. That’s why we believe that every business should be playing its part to help green the grid.”

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-10-01 21:27:15+00:00,Manchester Ink Link,"Shutdown tipping point was ACA tax credits, affecting 50000 in New Hampshire","Carol Robidoux, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://manchester.inklink.news/shutdown-tipping-point-was-aca-tax-credits-affecting-50000-in-new-hampshire/,"The proposed budget does not include renewal of the expanded health care tax credit for individuals and households who get health care insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
About 50,000 people in New Hampshire get the ACA expanded premium tax credit.
Some Republicans also claim that Democrats want undocumented immigrants to be eligible for the tax credit.
To be eligible for ACA health insurance, the individual must be a legal U.S. citizen or a lawfully documented citizen, and no Democratic proposal changes that.
“The American people want to be able to afford health care and they want to keep the federal government open,” Hassan said.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The biggest sticking point that has resulted in lack of a federal budget and the government shutdown is the high increase to health insurance premiums for millions of Americans and around 50,000 New Hampshire residents.

The proposed budget does not include renewal of the expanded health care tax credit for individuals and households who get health care insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The tax credit allows people whose income is above what’s needed for Medicaid to get a reduced health care premium under ACA, an estimated 24 million Americans.

Ripple effects include higher health care insurance premiums and copays overall, higher hospital costs, and big hits for small, rural hospitals that area already being affected by Medicaid cuts.

“I have been clear that my two priorities as we approach the end of the fiscal year are to avoid a government shutdown and to extend the ACA premium tax credits that keep affordable health care within reach for tens of millions of Americans,” U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH said in a Monday night news release.

Shaheen had voted against House Republicans’ continuing resolution, which would keep funding the government until a budget is agreed on, and also voted in favor Senate Democrats’ bill to fund the government with a provision that protected access to affordable health care. Neither bill passed.

Before 2021, those who got the tax credit had to have a modified adjusted gross income of less than 400% of the federal poverty guideline (which is $15,650 for an individual this year). That would be $62,600 in 2025. The American Rescue Plan in 2021 extended the premium to those with higher incomes, and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 extended it to the end of this year.

The extension caps the cost of ACA health insurance premiums at 8.5% of modified adjusted gross income (the income a person pays taxes on) for those who make more than 400% of the federal poverty guideline. That means that the tax credit covers the difference between 8.5% of income and what the person would pay for their own health insurance, usually 10-20% of income, analysts say. About 50,000 people in New Hampshire get the ACA expanded premium tax credit.

Republicans who oppose the extension argue that the credits were enacted to help people during the pandemic and are no longer needed. They also argue that the tax credits cost too much – about $35 billion a year – and people and households with the incomes allowed by the expansion should be able to afford their health insurance premiums.

Some Republicans also claim that Democrats want undocumented immigrants to be eligible for the tax credit. This isn’t true. To be eligible for ACA health insurance, the individual must be a legal U.S. citizen or a lawfully documented citizen, and no Democratic proposal changes that.

Senators and representatives and their staffs get insurance through the ACA’s Small Business Health Options Program, with the federal government, as their employer, paying an average 72% of the cost of a premium. Most uninsured individuals and households who get ACA don’t have an employer to help offset the cost; most of those who do are employed by a small business.

A Kaiser Family Foundation report released Monday said that insurance premiums will likely double for those who get their insurance from the ACA marketplace.

The expanded tax credits are designed to help people who don’t get insurance through their employers, Cynthia Cox, director of the Program on the ACA for KFF said in a PBS interview.

“This is really small business owners, farmers and ranchers, other people who work at small companies that don’t offer health insurance,” Cox said. “And so, for them, they’re buying their own insurance and getting a tax credit to help with the cost.”

She said premiums for 22 million who get ACA will double, or more, without the tax credit.

“This could mean that they have to, say, make a change to their employment and get a different job that does offer health insurance if they can’t afford to continue paying for their own insurance, or they might become uninsured if they just aren’t able to afford to continue that coverage,” Cox said.

Cox said the ripple effect is that it’s already having an effect on insurance markets, with some insurers “charging even higher premiums for next year because they think that healthier people are going to drop out of the insurance market.”

She said hospitals are also concerned that more people without insurance will show up in the emergency room, something hospitals have to cover the cost of.

“So they’re concerned that there might have an increase in the number of people who aren’t able to pay for their hospitalization,” Cox said. “That might mean that some hospitals, particularly in rural areas, where they’re already struggling, might have to close.”

In her news release Monday, Shaheen said that many of the millions of Americans who rely on the tax credits are small business owners and their employees, older Americans and people living in rural communities.

Shaheen is the author of legislation to permanently extend ACA enhanced premium tax credits, the Health Care Affordability Act, along with U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill. It’s still in committee in the House and Senate.

“Without those tax credits, millions of Americans will have to make a difficult choice about what they’ll have to live without so they can afford health insurance,” Shaheen said during a Democratic spotlight hearing Monday. “I think that’s unacceptable in the United States of America.”

Shaheen, U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, and nine other Democratic senators, as well as Maine’s Angus King, who is independent, held the spotlight hearing Monday on the impact not extending the tax credits will have. A spotlight hearing is an unsanctioned congressional hearing held by Democrats, since they’re not authorized to hold hearings because they are not the party in power.

Shaheen said at the hearing that not extending the tax credits will affect all Americans, not just those who rely on them for health care.

“An increase as large as what’s being projected for health insurance could be devastating,” she said.

She said small businesses will also feel the impact. She said every single business she’s talked to that has employees who rely on ACA health care has shared their concerns with her about the impact on their business and their employees.

“This comes after the president and congressional Republicans passed a bill this summer that kicks 10 million Americans off of Medicaid. That was done in order to raise the money to pay for a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.”

She said the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that if nothing is done until the end of the year, 1.5 million people will already have lost their health insurance.

She said there is “real urgency” to extending the premium tax credit now, “because kicking the can down the road is going to make a real difference for working Americans.” She said if nothing is done at all, more than 4 million Americans will likely lose their health insurance and 24 million more will pay higher premiums.

“So, without those tax credits, millions of Americans will have to make the difficult choice about what they’ll have to live without so they can afford health insurance.”

Hassan, too, issued a statement pointing to the ACA tax credits as her reason for not siding with the Republican budget.

“The American people want to be able to afford health care and they want to keep the federal government open,” Hassan said. “I voted today for a bill that would have done both. Unfortunately, President Trump and congressional Republicans refused to work across the aisle and instead chose to shut the government down.”

Hassan added, “I urge leaders on both sides of the aisle, including President Trump, to come to the negotiating table and reach an agreement to protect health care and keep the government open.”

Shaheen said she has been “in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward.”",https://media-manchester.inklink.news/app/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01144209/Shaheen-speaks.png,N,,2025-10-01 20:00:50.904986

The U.S. tax credit was introduced in 2022 under President Joe Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Since August 2023, the tax credit has also been available for used electric cars, provided they meet specific requirements to qualify for the subsidy.","As of today, the tax credit for purchasing electric cars, both new and used, has expired in the US. Some manufacturers are reportedly trying to extend the availability of subsidies through their dealers for a little longer.

As U.S. President Trump decided in the summer, the tax credits of $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles and $4,000 for the purchase of used electric cars will end on September 30.

According to information from the Reuters press agency, Ford and General Motors are attempting to persuade car dealers to sign up for financing programs to extend the $7,500 benefit for leased vehicles beyond the expiration of the government subsidy.

A loophole

In doing so, the manufacturers are apparently exploiting a loophole in the subsidy guidelines: the manufacturers themselves, together with their financing service providers, are making a down payment for vehicles that are already in stock at dealerships but have not yet been sold to customers.

“Those down payments will qualify the lending arms for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles, according to the documents and dealers. From there, dealers would offer leases on those cars to retail customers as usual for several more months, with the $7,500 subsidy factored into the lease rate,” Reuters writes, citing information from dealers who were informed about this procedure by the manufacturers.

With this ‘trick’ and the ‘internal’ sale before September 30, dealers could continue to offer discounted vehicles in their leasing rates from October onwards until the ‘subsidized’ stock is depleted. However, the Reuters article does not provide any information on the number of vehicles to which this trick was applied.

“We worked with our GM dealers on an extended offer for customers to benefit from the tax credit for leases,” General Motors explained in response to a query from the news agency, but also did not provide any details on the scope of the offer.

Ford, on the other hand, stated that it was “working to provide Ford EV customers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until December 31.” At least a specific offer period, the fourth quarter, is mentioned here, but Ford also leaves open the question of how many vehicles can be offered in this way.

First a rush, then a slump?

Experts anticipate another surge in demand for electric cars in September, capitalizing on the subsidy. However, a slump in sales figures is forecast for the entire fourth quarter, similar to the trend in Germany after the abrupt end of the environmental bonus subsidy at the end of 2023. It is unclear how long it will take for the U.S. market to recover from the impact of the subsidy.

The U.S. tax credit was introduced in 2022 under President Joe Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Since August 2023, the tax credit has also been available for used electric cars, provided they meet specific requirements to qualify for the subsidy.

Since the turn of the year 2023/2024, it has also been possible to assign the tax credit, which was actually paid out with a delay when filing the tax return in the following year, to the dealer at the time of purchase. The dealer could then offer up to $7,500 in discount on the purchase and, in turn, apply for the government subsidy.

Some international automobile manufacturers have since decided to withdraw electric vehicle models from the US market, such as Honda and Nissan, while local manufacturers, including Tesla, are seeing lower sales and margins in their automotive sales.

While some conditions are changing, such as the tariffs on imported cars from Europe, and the U.S. government is investing in the mineral supply chain, it remains to be seen how the U.S. industry will recover from these changes.",https://newmobility.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Scherm­afbeelding-2025-10-01-om-11.13.57.png,N,,2025-10-01 18:01:38.404632

NORWELL, Mass., Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 18, 2025, DIH Holding US, Inc. (“DIH” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:DHAI) issued a press release disclosing that it had received a notice on September 12, 2025, from the Listing Qualifications Staff (“Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that it had failed to regain compliance under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) (the “Bid Price Rule”), so this matter was an additional basis for delisting. The Company is clarifying that since it was not current in filing its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2025, and Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Reports Rule”), this matter was also included as an additional basis for delisting in the September 12, 2025 notice. Therefore, the Company needs to address its non-compliance with the Reports Rule with the Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the “Panel”).

The Company has requested a hearing before the Panel, which has stayed the suspension of the Company’s Common Stock for a period of 15 days. In connection with this request, the Company also requested an extended stay of any further action pending the hearing (the “Additional Stay”) due to its non-compliance with the Reports Rule. At the hearing, the Company will present its plan to evidence compliance with all applicable listing criteria, including the MVLS Rule, the Bid Price Rule and the Reports Rule, and request an extension of time. The Panel has the authority to grant the Company an extension of up to 180 days from the date of the Staff’s delist determination for the MVLS and Bid Price Rules and 360 days from the initial filing delinquency. The Company is considering all options available to it to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule, the Bid Price Rule and the Reports Rule; however, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to evidence compliance within the period of time that may be granted by the Panel.

September 30, 2025

The Honorable Scott Bessent

Secretary

United States Department of the Treasury

1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW

Washington, D.C. 20220

Dear Secretary Bessent,

We write to alert you to a serious violation of Congressional intent that threatens great harm to U.S. taxpayer dollars and ask for your immediate assistance in rectifying this problem.

As you know, Congress recently enacted Public Law 119-21, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, giving working class families massive tax relief, ending the Green New Scam, and fully funding our border security and national security needs. As part of this law, Congress amended Sections 25E, 30D, and 45W of the tax code, which collectively provide tax credits for the purchase of certain “clean vehicles.” These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off. The intent of P.L. 119-21 is clear – no credits allowed after September 30, 2025.

To implement this law, on August 21, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance (IR-2025-86) which provided clarification on the availability of the EV subsidies for taxpayers who enter into a written binding contract and make a downpayment on an eligible “clean vehicle.” This guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer. It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal downpayment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months.

Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors. Treasury, working with the IRS, must act decisively to clarify the guidance to ensure that only written binding agreements which identify the lessee are eligible and that the deposit must be made by the end user to qualify. We look forward to working with you to address this issue promptly in order to protect taxpayer dollars.

Sincerely,

BERNIE MORENO

In the electric utility sector, the shutdown could affect state-run energy programs that are funded through appropriations, including energy efficiency programs, renewable energy, utility assistance for low-income households and revolving energy funds.
Most federal construction contracts are within this category, as “they were already awarded on a fixed-price basis and funding was appropriated at the time of the award,” according to an emailed AGC statement.

State and local private construction tied to federal projects would also likely face obstacles, added Geldert-Murphey.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Contractors across the country are measuring the impact of a government shutdown that went into effect Wednesday.

The stoppage will freeze construction activity immediately on certain sites, both temporarily and in some cases permanently.

In the electric utility sector, the shutdown could affect state-run energy programs that are funded through appropriations, including energy efficiency programs, renewable energy, utility assistance for low-income households and revolving energy funds. It could also slow or halt the approval and oversight process for new energy infrastructure.

The first pain point will be on projects that rely entirely on federal dollars, said Marsia Geldert-Murphey, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers and current senior associate at GBA, a Lenexa, Kansas-based AEC firm.

Though money could be technically in place, a shutdown could still sideline contracting officers and other oversight staff. That could leave projects stuck in neutral, Geldert-Murphey said.

“The real problem is going to be the federal employees,” said Geldert-Murphey. “Are they going to be furloughed? In many cases, we can’t move forward with the project if the federal oversight is not there.”

While projects in progress are typically allowed to move forward, any activities that require input or approval from government employees simply cannot proceed, said Erik Wright, principal at Precision Construction Services, a San Luis Obispo, California-based contractor. He added that delays are more likely than cancellations in these instances.

“When the government shut down in late 2018, early 2019 for around 20 working days, projects in the final stages of contracting or early stages of construction were delayed three to four months,” Wright said. “We had contracts in process late in 2018 that didn’t end up coming through until April and May of 2019, which presented significant cash flow and staffing challenges for us.”

Being in a state of limbo would have immediate effects on contracts and supply chains. Prices are locked for only so long, and prolonged delays force suppliers to reprice bids and contractors to remobilize crews at added cost, Geldert-Murphy said.

Fixed-price contracts

On the other hand, existing fixed-price contracts with appropriated funds should be allowed to continue, according to Associated General Contractors of America. Most federal construction contracts are within this category, as “they were already awarded on a fixed-price basis and funding was appropriated at the time of the award,” according to an emailed AGC statement.

That includes projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as well as the Highway Trust Fund, according to AGC. The IIJA included funding for a number of energy initiatives, including regional hydrogen hubs, carbon capture, advanced nuclear reactors, energy storage, grid resilience and electric vehicles.

Projects sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration should not be impacted, since they’re not subject to annual appropriations, according to AGC. In other words, these agencies should continue to make timely payments to contractors on work performed, regardless of a government shutdown.

But cost-type contracts and awards still in the pipeline are far more exposed to the fallout of a shutdown, should one happen. State and local private construction tied to federal projects would also likely face obstacles, added Geldert-Murphey.

“If the federal project is delayed and you’re assuming that you’re going to be building connecting to something that’s already built, the cascading effect can be devastating,” Geldert-Murphey said. “If they [contractors] don’t have that communication on the federal side, you’re at a standstill, which is again, a domino effect of pushing back decisions that are being made.”

Many state, municipal and nonprofit projects rely on federal grants, said Wright, meaning that a public shutdown could discourage private clients from moving ahead with capital projects as well.

“The construction supply chain is tightly interconnected, so if federal infrastructure or defense work slows, demand volatility for materials and subcontractors will spread beyond federal jobs,” Wright said. “Repeated shutdowns erode confidence in the government as a reliable contracting partner, which can influence how firms price future bids and whether they pursue certain opportunities at all.”

At Messer Construction, a Cincinnati-based contractor, Paul Richter echoed these concerns.

“A prolonged shutdown lasting several months could potentially stunt progress for planning and development of future projects, leading to a disruption to the flow of work on a longer-term horizon,” said Richter, the operations vice president.

The firm’s military projects are largely insulated in the short-term, Richter said, because funding through the Military Construction program or Operations and Maintenance accounts is typically locked in well in advance. The risk stems from facility staff who may be sent home, which would prevent renovation projects from moving forward. Richter added that a lengthy shutdown would hinder future work as well.

That uncertainty, ultimately, will hamstring construction activity once again.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/e578ZA9uivpWfoKCZFTGg_VK8_V4QfzFQz2uDVLF8lY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjM4MTIzMzA2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-01 18:02:10.441398

Shell Lubricants, a division of the Shell Oil Company, has created a breakthrough new thermal management fluid for use in EVs, according to New Atlas.

While that might sound like something that requires a degree in chemistry to understand, the end result is simple: faster charging times.

But just how much faster? Shell has claimed that its fluid allows EVs to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in about 10 minutes, per New Atlas.

Several challenges have confronted experts looking for ways to charge EVs faster. Namely, fast charging can compromise safety and potentially shorten a battery's lifespan.

According to a statement by Shell, the company ""has successfully formulated and demonstrated a high-performance EV thermal management fluid with the ability to unlock significant reductions in charging times without compromise to battery safety, thermal stability or lifespan, aiding the widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles.""

In the comment section of the New Atlas article, readers expressed mixed views on the announcement.

""This is great news,"" said one commenter. ""I'm impressed that even oil companies are seeing the inevitable (and profitable) future.""

Others were more skeptical.

""It's probably a consumable,"" another commenter wrote. ""EVs will take over, but now you'll need to go to Shell to get your 'battery gas.'""

While companies can change, consumers have plenty of reasons to be wary of Shell based on the company's checkered history.

For example, a Shell subsidiary operating in Nigeria has faced years of litigation over allegations that, in 2008, two of the company's pipelines leaked oil into local waterways for five straight weeks. Last summer, a Nigerian monarch demanded that the company pay billions in reparations before shutting down operations in the country.

While EVs do have an environmental cost, research shows that their cradle-to-grave environmental impact is far less than that of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

For example, while the world still generates much of its electricity from burning dirtier, nonrenewable fuels like coal and natural gas, an EV charged off the average American power grid still is only responsible for as much heat-trapping pollution as a gas-powered car getting 100 miles per gallon, according to MIT Climate Portal.

To push the environmental benefits of driving an EV even further, and to save money on electricity, you can charge your EV with home solar. Doing so is cheaper than charging off the grid or at a public charging station, while also giving you the added satisfaction of knowing your vehicle is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

If upgrading to home solar feels overwhelming, EnergySage can help with free, easy-to-use online tools that allow you to compare quotes among vetted local installers while also making sure that you take maximum advantage of government rebates and other incentives available in your state.

However, federal EV tax credits shuttered Sept. 30. With tax credits for solar expiring Dec. 31, this is your last chance to act if you want to take advantage of the thousands of dollars in potential savings.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shell-thermal-management-fluidimage-recbt5cnGUSjfChYU.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 18:01:47.733056

The details: Farley made the statement, speaking at the Ford Pro Accelerate skilled trades conference on Tuesday. He also confirmed a Reuters report that the automaker is rolling out a program to effectively extend the use of the $7,500 U.S. tax credit on EV leases beyond the September 30 expiration of the federal subsidy.

Under the program, Ford’s financing arm will purchase EVs in dealer inventory by making down payments on the vehicles.

Those down payments will qualify the lending arm for the federal $7,500 tax credit.

Dealers can then lease those EVs to retail customers for a few more months, with the subsidy factored into the lease rate.

❝

What they’re saying: “Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle...” said Ford CEO Jim Farley, (via The Detroit News). “I wouldn't be surprised if the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5% of our industry from probably this month, 10%, 12%.""

Between the lines: Beyond the short-term lease fix, Ford is laying out a longer-term EV strategy designed to weather headwinds and reignite growth in the segment.

In August, the automaker said it would delay the launch of two new EVs, including an E-Transit van and the successor to the F-150 Lightning, now pushed back until 2028.

Ford is also investing nearly $2 billion to retool a Kentucky facility for more affordable EVs, beginning with a mid-size electric truck.

“Vehicles assembled on this platform will be affordable for the average family—but also highly efficient, customizable, and fun to drive. And they won’t be stripped down to the bare essentials,” Farley said in a press release, with Ford touting the strategy as a “Model T Moment.”

Bottom line: Ford is preparing for a sharp EV sales slowdown as federal tax credits vanish, but its lease program offers dealers short-term relief.

The attorneys general said companies don’t actually use that energy, and this doesn't make them “powered by” renewables.
The attorneys general also claim the tech companies are pushing utilities toward “harmful net-zero goals,” and this has led to coal and gas plants shutting their doors.

In a letter to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft dated Sept. 24, the attorneys general accused them of using “environmental accounting gimmicks” to say they’re powered by renewables.

“These claims appear deceptive given the increasing electricity demands of those companies and the realities of the U.S. electrical grid,” the letter says, before requesting the companies answer a series of questions about their energy use, policies and claims.

The state officials specifically criticize how the tech companies buy clean energy.

“The attorney generals are questioning the longstanding way we've done things,” said John Rogers, associate director of energy analytics at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Rogers said companies don’t always have control over where utilities get power. So, they may buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) from solar or wind farms to be more green and offset their energy use.

The attorneys general said companies don’t actually use that energy, and this doesn't make them “powered by” renewables. A spokesperson from Amazon said this reliance on RECs is temporary.

“Amazon purchases RECs as a temporary bridging mechanism while we wait for renewable energy projects to come online,” the spokesperson wrote via email.

Rogers said buying RECs fuels more demand for renewables.

“You can be forcing action elsewhere in the market,” he explained.

The attorneys general also claim the tech companies are pushing utilities toward “harmful net-zero goals,” and this has led to coal and gas plants shutting their doors.

“These utility commitments have helped contribute to the phenomenon of early retirement of coal and natural gas plants, which is raising state concerns and threatening the integrity of the electric grid,” the letter reads.

The attorneys general also say that this threatens President Donald Trump’s efforts to “unleash American energy.""

Rogers said these points may suggest the state officials have ulterior motives.

“Their interest may not be entirely about ensuring the integrity of renewable energy markets and more about propping up fossil fuels,” he said.

The letter asks companies to respond to Montana’s Officer of Consumer Protection by Oct. 27.

The spokesperson from Amazon said the company has received the letter and is reviewing it. A representative for Microsoft said no comment. Google and Meta did not respond by deadline.

Josh Stein criticized Duke Energy in a statement for ""retreating from the state's clean energy future.""
Wind: Plans for offshore and onshore wind have been shelved, after a previous plan called for 3,600 megawatts of wind energy by 2035.
Coal: The Duke plan also calls for delaying the closures of three coal-fired plants (Belews Creek, Cliffside and Marshall) that were previously set to retire in the mid-2030s.
Editor's note: This story has been updated with further details from Duke Energy about customer bills.","Duke Energy plans to meet surging demand for energy in the Carolinas by increasing its natural gas capacity, delaying the closures of some coal plants and evaluating two sites for nuclear power, according to a new plan filed with the state.

At the same time, however, the rate at which it plans to acquire more solar energy capacity is slowing, and it has shelved plans for offshore wind at least through 2040.

Why it matters: Duke is seeking to balance a surge in demand for energy with a measured response to new federal and state policy. But some environmental groups are criticizing the Charlotte-based utility for moving away from a low-carbon energy mix.

Driving the news: This is the first carbon reduction plan that Duke Energy has filed with the state's utility commission since the N.C. General Assembly passed a law that eliminated the requirement that Duke reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2030.

It also comes as electricity demand is growing due largely to a rise in data centers and manufacturing. Duke's own projections put energy demand 7% higher in 2035 than it forecasted last year.

Between the lines: Duke Energy is required to file a carbon plan with the state periodically so that regulators can monitor how the utility plans to reach carbon neutrality.

A bipartisan law passed in 2021 mandates that Duke hit neutrality by 2050, with the caveat that it does so as cheaply as possible while maintaining reliability.

To that point, Duke Energy says the new plan is projected to raise customer bills 2.1% a year over the next decade — lower than the previous plan.

A Duke spokesperson later told Axios that the 2.1% is just the cost to implement the plan, and that other factors independent of the plan affect customer rates.

What they're saying: Gov. Josh Stein criticized Duke Energy in a statement for ""retreating from the state's clean energy future.""

""Duke has eliminated wind, reduced solar and delayed nuclear while increasing our dependence on price-volatile natural gas and coal,"" Stein says, calling on the utilities commission to ""require significant changes.""

Zoom in: Here's what Duke's plan calls for:

Natural gas: More than 9,650 additional megawatts of natural gas capacity by 2033, including two more combustion turbines.

Nuclear: Duke says it is evaluating two potential sites for new nuclear reactors (one in Belews Creek, N.C., and Cherokee County, S.C.) with the hopes of adding more than 1,100 additional megawatts of nuclear energy by 2037. The goal is to secure an early site permit at Belews Creek this year, Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president, told Axios.

Solar: Increase solar capacity to 7,900 megawatts by 2033, though that is a decrease from a previous plan that called for 8,200 megawatts by 2031.

Wind: Plans for offshore and onshore wind have been shelved, after a previous plan called for 3,600 megawatts of wind energy by 2035.

Coal: The Duke plan also calls for delaying the closures of three coal-fired plants (Belews Creek, Cliffside and Marshall) that were previously set to retire in the mid-2030s.

Battery storage: Investments into battery storage technology are increasing to 7,900 megawatts by 2033.

The other side: Clean energy groups criticized Duke Energy for taking a step back from solar and wind, and for not investing more in battery storage, energy-efficient technologies and grid flexibility.

Josh Brooks, a strategist at the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, tells Axios he questions the strategy of ""doubling down on gas, when it's already causing rates to rise.""

Meanwhile, the Sierra Club, in a statement, said the decision to keep relying on coal plants is ""disappointing and unsettling."" And Vote Solar's statement says ""higher costs for families, more pollution in local communities and a worsening climate crisis"" will result.

Yes, but: Duke Energy's new investments in storage, Brooks says, are ""promising to see,"" even though he thinks more work on the demand side of the grid is urgently needed.

Peter Toomey, an executive at Cypress Creek Renewables, which partners with Duke on solar and storage projects, says the new commitment ""demonstrates the forward-looking leadership needed.""

State of play: Duke Energy says its new plan responds to changes in government policies, with the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act taking away tax credits for solar and wind but adding incentives for nuclear power and battery storage.

The state has also given it more flexibility to use coal, and it is taking that opportunity.

""Those all have impacts on our plan to power this robust growth with focus on reliability,"" Glen Snider, Duke Energy's managing director of integrated resource planning, tells Axios.

What's next: The N.C. Utilities Commission will take comments on Duke Energy's plan for the next few months, before making a ruling on Duke's plan next year.

American Commercial Barge Line, which owns the former Jeffboat property, announced last week that the Indiana Economic Development Corporation has awarded a $20 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. to support the riverfront development

This grant follows a $6.5 million Indiana READI grant awarded to the project in December.

According to the news release, this grant funding is a “foundation for the transformation of the Jeffersonville riverfront into a vibrant, mixed use development.”

Steve Bollinger is principal and executive vice president of business development at Thrive Companies, the agency serving as master developer for the project.

He said these grants, along with potential upcoming tax increment financing, or TIF dollars, are what make redevelopment of the former shipyard on prime riverside real estate viable.

“Otherwise, this project doesn’t happen,” he said. “So it’s everything.”

Jeffboat closed in 2018 after 80 years of barge-building operations at the site. The footprint includes what was originally the Howard shipyard, which opened in 1838 for steamboat production.

The past several years have seen a renewed spirit in what could be the next iteration of the mile-long strip of land long devoted to boat-building.

In 2023, planners unveiled a preliminary framework for what could potentially go there, including housing, retail, residential and green spaces.

Project timeline

Over the next three to six months, project leaders will start gathering community input on whether the architectural pieces discussed during the first planning phases are still what residents want to see there.

“And obviously it needs to be done with the economics of the deal being a part of it,” said Bollinger. “Because what we don't want to do is put something out there [that’s not] based in reality.”

Site work is expected to start within nine to 12 months and take around two years. That includes bringing in a lot of dirt — an estimated 700,000 cubic square feet — to raise parts of the site.

Once the site is ready, construction is slated to begin in late 2028 or early 2029. Bollinger said parkspace should be finished before or around the same time the first structures are completed. That will pull in downtown Jeffersonville as well as downtown Louisville, “and there's this connection through it all.”

This is Thrive Companies’ first project out of central Ohio. They’re based in Columbus. The team became interested in developing the Indiana riverfront site early on in the process, Bollinger said.

That interest grew when they discovered how much state and local support there was for redevelopment at the site.

Upon visiting the city, they also were impressed with amenities like the Big Four Bridge and historic downtown area.

“It's just like, ‘Man, this city has mojo to it. It has a vibe to it. It's …creating its own thing, and it feels really good,” he said.

Jeffersonville Mayor Mike Moore said he feels lucky and is glad state leaders see the value in this project in Jeffersonville.

The city partnered to help fund initial designs a couple years ago. He said it can also use TIF dollars to help fund amenities like the extension of the Ohio River Greenway through the area.

Moore said he wants the site to be publicly accessible.

“I don't want a gated entrance where you got to live there to get in there,” he said. “We're going to have thriving restaurants down there and a beautiful boardwalk to…have a nice, safe place to enjoy the river view and mingle and walk around to restaurants, coffee shops and pubs.”

George Piccioni, vice president of business development at American Commercial Barge Line, said in the release the grant funding comes after more than four years of planning.

The report stated that without voluntary commitments from companies to purchase renewable power, many projects would face financing challenges, threatening the ability to meet rising US electricity demand.

It also underscores the importance of virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), which allow companies to lock in long-term contract with renewable energy projects to buy the future electricity generated at a predetermined price.

Securing financing for a project is contingent upon the loan provider having clarity on who will purchase the electricity and at what price.

Without such contracts in place, projects are unlikely to obtain the necessary loans for development.

CEBA US strategy senior vice-president Misti Groves stated: “It confirms that corporate buyers are critical to ensuring the US can build enough clean energy at the pace and scale that’s needed to meet skyrocketing power demand from the growth in artificial intelligence, electrification, and a resurgence in US manufacturing.”

Pine Gate Renewables executive vice-president David Groleau stated: “Corporate buyers are the backbone of clean energy deployment, anchoring project financing and shaping the future of reliable, cost-effective power.”

Pine Gate is a US-based company that develops, owns and operates utility scale solar and energy storage projects.

Completed by the renewable energy data firm REsurety, the study examined the economic performance of 251 wind and solar projects within three key power markets: the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and PJM Interconnection.

The findings revealed that the renewable power projects frequently encounter substantial financial challenges in generating revenue without the backing of corporate buyers.

VPPAs decrease the number of projects experiencing financial difficulties – by 90% in MISO and PJM, and by 80% in ERCOT.

Renewable energy certificates (RECs) play a significant role by decreasing the number of projects facing financial difficulties by 30% and offering a stable source of additional revenue.

Since 2016, corporate buyers have emerged as a stabilising influence in the US clean energy sector, contributing to more than 40% of the new clean energy capacity additions.

Solar energy company Primergy chief commercial officer Emily Cohen stated: “The acceleration of corporate purchases from clean energy projects transformed the US market over the past 10 years, providing developers and owners long-term, stable revenues on projects and a view on future demand to help maintain continued growth.

“As new markets evolve, we are excited to see more corporates buying energy across the country to bring the benefits of new energy resources.”

General Motors Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. said they would extend discounts on certain electric models after a $7,500 federal tax credit expired Tuesday, a bid to maintain momentum after a surge in third-quarter sales.

Car companies are stepping in to preserve discounts and smooth the sell-down of existing EV inventory after the federal EV subsidy phased out Sept. 30. GM and Ford are making the $7,500 discount available for leased vehicles that are in transit or on dealer lots. Hyundai’s offer applies to leases and purchases: The Korean automaker will kick in $7,500 in cash for the 2025 version of its Ioniq 5; it’s also lowering the price of the 2026 model by as much as $9,800, depending on the trim.

EV sales are expected to slow in coming quarters as President Donald Trump’s policy changes take hold and automakers dial back production and rejigger product plans to add more gas and hybrid models. Full battery-electric models have been a tough sell for many American car buyers, who’ve been turned off by high prices and spotty charging infrastructure.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%” from about 10% now, Ford CEO Jim Farley said at a conference in Detroit this week. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

Automakers’ profits are already taking a hit to absorb the cost of US tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. Based on the trade agreements Trump announced this summer, tariffs could add an extra $5,500 to the cost of an imported vehicle, and $1,000 on US-assembled vehicles with imported components, according to researcher Cox Automotive.

EV Divergence

Growth in EV sales in the US are not expected to move much this decade, reaching 11% of the U.S. market by 2029 compared with 8.1% last year, according to a September forecast by EY, a unit of consultant Ernst & Young Global.

But it’s a different story in other parts of the world. EY predicts EVs in Europe will make up more than half of new vehicle sales by 2032. In China, they’ll surpass half the market in 2033.

Automakers are pursuing different strategies to cope with the uneven pace of adoption. While Hyundai is retooling its $5.5 billion plant in Savannah, Ga., to make hybrids as well as EVs, it’s not downplaying their market relevance.

“I do believe because of the surge we saw in September, there’s going to be a reset in October, maybe November. But the EV market will settle,” said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai’s North America business.

“There was an EV market before the IRA and there’s going to be an EV market after the IRA,” he told reporters on a call Sept. 30, referencing former President Joe Biden’s climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act.

Hyundai said it’s dipping into its own pocket to fund the $7,500 cash rebate on the 2025 Ioniq 5 and the discounts on 2026 models.

Parker said the move “showcases our financial strength and the ability to navigate the market with a lot of uncertainty.”

Ford and GM are simply passing along the value of federal credits they already locked in through their finance arms.

GM Financial put a down payment on about 30,000 EVs before Oct. 1, which means the credit company can lease the vehicles with the tax credit baked into the price. Once a lease is written, the lender gets paid back by the Internal Revenue Service, said a person familiar with GM’s operations.

The once-popular Xterra was discontinued in the United States a decade ago due to tougher emissions standards and a broader industry shift away from boxier, truck-based SUVs.
The carmaker imports EVs like the Leaf to the United States from Japan, but has reduced those volumes due to tariffs.
The company is hoping those models bolster sales in the United States, which slid 6.5% in the second quarter and were flat in the first six months of the year.
Meunier said the revamped Xterra will share a platform, hybrid powertrain and parts with the midsized Frontier pickup, Pathfinder SUV, Infiniti QX60 and possibly another as-yet-unnamed Infiniti SUV.","Nissan Motor Co. will revive its Xterra SUV as a hybrid model to be built in Mississippi and halt plans to make an electric vehicle in the United States, according to its top executive for the Americas.

The Japanese carmaker will reboot the Xterra nameplate in 2028 as a V-6 engine-powered hybrid to help fill unused capacity at its plant in Canton, Mississippi, said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. It’s also considering building an upscale Infiniti version of that model and moving the full-size Armada and Infiniti QX80 SUVs to the factory.

“The dealers are super excited about it because it’s going to be a great example of Nissan coming back,” Meunier said in an interview Tuesday, adding it will “bring scale back to the plant and get the costs at the right level.”

Nissan is undergoing a massive downsizing effort globally as it tries to regain profitability, but in the key U.S. market it’s planning to boost gas-powered vehicle output in response to President Donald Trump’s trade and environmental policies.

The once-popular Xterra was discontinued in the United States a decade ago due to tougher emissions standards and a broader industry shift away from boxier, truck-based SUVs.

As part of the shift, Nissan has frozen plans to make a fully-electric model in Mississippi as U.S. demand for EVs has softened — and may drop further with the expiration this month of federal subsidies. As recently as March, Nissan had said it was on track to launch a battery electric model in Canton in 2028 and planned to source batteries for it locally from South Korea’s SK On.

The carmaker imports EVs like the Leaf to the United States from Japan, but has reduced those volumes due to tariffs. Nissan continues to consider options for making EVs in the United States, but Meunier said that may hinge on dramatic cuts to manufacturing costs or finding a partner to split the risk.

“With the market being very uncertain about EVs, I think it’s the right thing to do,” he said.

Meanwhile, Nissan is readying a new version of its entry-level, Mexican-made and gas-powered Sentra compact sedan for launch in the United States later this year and a plug-in hybrid option for its best-selling Rogue compact SUV in early 2026. The company is hoping those models bolster sales in the United States, which slid 6.5% in the second quarter and were flat in the first six months of the year. On Wednesday, Nissan will release U.S. deliveries for the most recent quarter through September.

Meunier said the revamped Xterra will share a platform, hybrid powertrain and parts with the midsized Frontier pickup, Pathfinder SUV, Infiniti QX60 and possibly another as-yet-unnamed Infiniti SUV.

Nissan’s other U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, was set to go down to a single work shift earlier this year, but the carmaker decided to maintain two production shifts daily after the Trump administration imposed tariffs. Meunier, who rejoined Nissan in January after a stint at rival Stellantis NV, said he hopes to add a third shift in Smyrna once an all-new version of the Rogue debuts.

While the White House’s tariffs have injected uncertainty into the auto industry and upended supply chains, the Nissan executive said the tough trade regime has injected a needed sense of urgency into Nissan’s attempted makeover of its U.S. operations.

“I keep saying it’s a good thing for Nissan, it forces us to rethink, he said. “It forces the company to do the right thing. When you think about a big market like the U.S., you need to be localized.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/01/PDTN/86455022007-nissanbg-sizdm-3-i-67-re-4-fotb-74-pyfcpo-5-q.jpg?crop=2999,1688,x0,y156&width=2999&height=1688&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-01 19:02:30.420914

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said in a press release a Biden-era rule governing the phaseout of these chemicals led to “an increase in consumer costs and shortages.”

As a result, the EPA says that to address the issue, it will propose to allow the use of refrigerants that are much more potent contributors to global warming for the time being.

HFCs are a family of chemicals that are used in cooling, including in refrigerators and air conditioners.

They replaced ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. However, they are highly potent greenhouse gases and therefore have become a significant contributor to climate change.

In 2020, President Trump signed a bipartisan compromise into law that requires an 85 percent phasedown in their use by 2036.

In 2023, the Biden administration issued a rule restricting the use of more potent HFCs during the phasedown. The Biden rule limited some sectors to only using hydrofluorocarbons that are no more than 150, 300 or 700 times as powerful as carbon dioxide.

The Trump administration is now proposing to loosen the rules for certain sectors, allowing retail fridges to now use chemicals that are 1,400 times as powerful as carbon dioxide, for example. It is also delaying compliance timelines for certain industrial process refrigerators.

Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin joined the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition last month, increasing membership to 13 state governors.

Launched in May, the coalition aims to promote more affordable electric vehicles, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and preserve states’ authority under the Clean Air Act.

The coalition was formed by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 24 governors. States will address their own challenges and opportunities while working together to achieve the coalition’s collective goals, the Climate Alliance said in a press release.

Dive Insight:

New electric vehicle sales were strong in the past two months as buyers rushed to take advantage of federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30. However, the share of EVs compared to total automotive sales declined in the second quarter both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter, according to CleanTechnica.

“Sales of EVs will likely fall dramatically when tax credits expire,” said Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlie Chesbrough in an Aug. 27 statement.

A further blow to EVs came in June when Congress and the Trump administration ended California’s authority to set its own stronger vehicle emission standards. A 1990 federal law allows 17 additional states and the District of Columbia to follow California’s vehicle emissions regulations.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing many of the industry’s automakers and suppliers, supported the administration’s actions. “An aggressive regulatory push toward battery electric vehicles – ahead of consumer demand and without market readiness – will reduce U.S. vehicle production and auto jobs versus a more balanced approach that prioritizes and preserves vehicle choice,” said the group’s president and CEO, John Bozzella, in an April 29 blog post.

The coalition’s 11 initial governors said in a May 23 statement that “The federal government and Congress are putting polluters over people and creating needless chaos for consumers and the market.”

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a Sept. 4 statement, “We need to make it easier, not harder, for consumers to upgrade to electric vehicles — and that’s exactly what we’re doing through this state-led partnership.”

The Climate Alliance said it is making resources available to coalition members to help them reduce vehicle pollution and enable consumer access to more affordable zero-emission vehicles.

Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in an emailed statement that the organization is “proud of Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin for joining 11 other states to improve access to electric vehicles at a time when the federal government works to prop up the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our economic well-being and health.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Vh3Q-yrLd0frxR23T1lSKf7mCD9z1fkXoEc-JCJUePg/g:nowe:0:233/c:2500:1412/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjA0NTg4MDQ0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-01 17:04:30.062548

ICYMI: Senator Murray Comments After Republicans Push Country Into Shutdown

***WATCH full press conference HERE; DOWNLOAD HERE***

Washington, D.C. – Today,U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a senior member and former chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, held a virtual press conference on how Democrats are fighting to save critical Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits that middle-class families in Washington state and across the country rely on to be able to afford health insurance. Joining Senator Murray for the press conference were Washington State Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer and Maya Tussing, a small business owner in Washington state who relies on ACA tax credits to afford health care.

At the press conference, Senator Murray called out Republicans for refusing to come to the table to negotiate a deal with Democrats to keep the government open and protect Americans’ health care, and reiterated that she stands ready to negotiate a bipartisan funding bill to reopen the government and prevent Americans’ health care costs from skyrocketing. Senator Murray has been speaking out nonstop about the urgent need to save health care and keep the government open and calling on Republicans to come to the negotiating table to work out a bipartisan deal—which they have so far refused to do. As the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray leads legislation supported by the Democratic caucus that would reopen the government, address the health care crisis, and protect Congress’ power of the purse from Donald Trump and Russ Vought’s nonstop, lawless efforts to block funding from reaching communities across the country.

For months, Republicans have refused to extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits, and if they are left to expire, 22 million Americans across the country—including more than 216,000 people in Washington state—will see their health care costs and premiums skyrocket. Premiums will more than double for Americans who buy health care through the ACA exchanges, and these higher costs will push 4.2 million people off their health coverage over the next decade—including an estimated 80,000 people in Washington state. In Washington state, health insurers have been approved for an average rate hike of 21 percent this year in large part due to the Republican failure to extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits. A fact sheet on what the expiration of the ACA tax credits would mean for people in Washington state is HERE.

“I don’t know why Republicans think they can just sweep the health care crisis they created under the rug. But we are here to say: we are forcing this issue. We are going to talk about health care whether Republicans want to or not,” said Senator Murray. “The American people are demanding action, and they are demanding it now. Why? Because the new, higher health care rates—those are being set right now. Notifications to families? Those are in the mail now. Open enrollment is weeks away, and families are panicking. I have heard from one family in Washington state whose premiums could jump from $278 a month, to as much as $1,800 a month. There is a simple solution here—to simply save the ACA tax credits that 22 million people rely on to afford health care—including over 200,000 people in Washington state. Republicans have made clear they will quite literally shut down the government rather than address this problem.”

Senator Murray played a critical role in passing the enhanced premium tax credits in the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and extending them in the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and she has been fighting for months to make sure these important health care tax credits don’t expire, including cosponsoring multiple pieces of legislation—the Health Care Affordability Act and the Protecting Health Care and Lowering Costs Act—that would make them permanent.

“Last year, more than 216,000 people in the individual market qualified for enhanced premium tax credits. Tax credits are crucial to helping people afford and keep coverage,” said Washington State Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer. “Our Exchange predicts that 80,000 people to drop coverage, if the enhanced premium tax credits are not extended. If fewer people are enrolled because of costs, older and sicker people will remain, driving up costs for everyone. This, along with growing uncertainty at the federal level does not bode well for next year. As your insurance commissioner, I can tell you what insurers do NOT like and that’s uncertainty. Uncertainty does NOT create a stable, vibrant, competitive market. It creates chaos and high costs for consumers.”

“Six years ago, I launched a small business with a partner that helps nonprofits manage their financial resources. We’re lean, we’re mission driven, and we’re growing, and most importantly, we are passionate about what we do. However, we’re not large enough to provide me and my family with employer sponsored health insurance, and that’s why the ACA was a lifeline for me, because it allowed us to focus on building our business without my agonizing over how to secure health insurance. And at the time, it seemed like a stroke of luck, and an example of the US’ brilliant policy innovation. And it sounds a bit sappy, but it was the first time I really felt fortunate to be an American because of the incredible dynamism in this country and the fact that everyone here is so supportive of small business owners, and it seems so easy to launch a business. But while our take home pay grew steadily, our health care premium spiked. And last year they increased fivefold, and with the expiration of tax credits, they’ll double, making it tenfold—a tenfold increase in two years. And our health care costs could cost more than our home life and auto insurance combined,” said Maya Tussing, a small business owner in Washington state who relies on ACA tax credits to afford health care. “Running a small business requires reliable expense forecasting, and that means that if these credits expire, many entrepreneurs will face sudden premium spikes that they couldn’t have anticipated. And that kind of unpredictability can be devastating, especially when it’s driven by policy decisions that are totally beyond our control… Families like mine are bracing for higher premiums, deductibles and co pays, and then we’ll be forced to ask ourselves, how sick do I have to be before I can justify paying for treatment? And that’s not how health care should work in the wealthiest country in the world. And this is the moment for Congress to act.”

Senator Murray’s remarks, as delivered on today’s press call, are below:

“Thank you all for joining me today.

“We are here to put a spotlight on an issue Republicans are trying as hard as they possibly can to ignore—the health care crisis they have created, which is forcing people to lose their health insurance, hospitals to close their doors, and will soon mean millions of Americans will pay more than double what they pay now for their health care premiums if Congress doesn’t act.

“Seriously, Republicans have decided they would rather shut down the government than talk to Democrats about preventing premiums from exploding next year.

“One big issue with that Republican plan? Ignoring—or lying about—this problem won’t make it go away. Families with health care at stake know this all too well.

“Because when you go online to buy health insurance and find your monthly payment has more than doubled—you are going to notice it. When your health care is suddenly way out of budget for your family, that’s not something you can ignore. In fact, it’s something that will break the bank for many people, and force millions to simply drop their coverage altogether.

“I don’t know why Republicans think they can just sweep the health care crisis they created under the rug. But we are here to say: we are forcing this issue. We are going to talk about health care whether Republicans want to or not.

“And it’s clear as day, they do not. Because they know their position is unpopular—a top House Republican recently said as much in private—and urged colleagues ‘don’t talk about it.’

“So Democrats are going to force Republicans to come to the table to negotiate with us. The American people are demanding action, and they are demanding it now.

“Why? Because the new, higher health care rates—those are being set right now. Notifications to families? Those are in the mail now. Open enrollment is weeks away, and families are panicking.

“I have heard from one family in Washington state whose premiums could jump from $278 a month, to as much as $1,800 a month.

“There is a simple solution here—to simply save the ACA tax credits that 22 million people rely on to afford health care—including over 200,000 people in Washington state.

“Republicans have made clear they will quite literally shut down the government rather than address this problem.

“What do they plan on telling farmers—a quarter of whom are enrolled in the health care exchanges, who will see their costs increase exponentially? What do they plan to tell small business owners, and workers, and people who are self-employed—half of whom get their coverage through the ACA exchanges?

“Because saying ‘tough luck’ is not going to cut it. And neither is ‘we’ll fix it later’ for that matter. Later is too late! Republicans are saying they will just sit on their hands until those higher rates are locked in for the next year, and that is unacceptable.

“We have to act now. Families know it. Patients know it. Small business owners know it.

“And that’s why Democrats are insisting on acting now. We are not going to let Republicans keep sabotaging Americans’ health care. Democrats are fighting to reverse the cuts, lower costs, and protect health care for the people we represent back home.

“People who are speaking out about just how devastating it will be if Republicans refuse to save these critical health care tax credits. I’m joined by some of them today.

“Republicans may shut down the government, but they will not shut down this debate.

“And they will not shut out the voices of people across the country who want us to act before their health care costs skyrocket, before their insurance is out of reach, before it is too late.”

Federal employees will be furloughed, or asked to work without pay, and construction projects will be delayed. If the shutdown continues through November, public housing residents could lose access to government benefits.

Until Congress agrees on a spending package for the new fiscal year, museums and national parks will likely close doors to visitors.

The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD), under Secretary Scott Turner, is pointing fingers. On HUD’s homepage: “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government” greets visitors. A similar message is emblazoned on a White House webpage where a graphic of a clock tallies how long the shutdown has been going on for.

Legal experts have already said HUD’s claims are “likely to be a Hatch Act violation,” an 86-year-old law set to limit the political activity of federal employees.

The National Housing Law Project (NHLP), which monitors the Trump administration’s impact on affordable and public housing, is closely watching the shutdown. “HUD is already operating with very reduced staff,” NHLP deputy director Deborah Thorpe told AN. “The shutdown is adding additional uncertainty.”

NHLP, in a statement, said most HUD tenants should not experience disruption thanks to the shutdown but, “If the shutdown lasts past November, your rights might change and you should contact an attorney for updated information.”

“The most important message for federally assisted tenants right now is that their rent should be paid,” Thorpe said.

“This shut down means I can become homeless or my landlord can start eviction procedures against me,” Renette Bradley, a NYCHA Section 8 resident, told AN. “Many others are facing the same trouble.”

AIA Weighs In

The AIA, in a statement, said the “shutdown will additionally impact architects, especially those working on public projects or relying on federal funding in program areas prioritized by AIA, including resiliency, affordable housing, and the environment.”

Architects collaborating with the federal government on affordable housing projects; and with FEMA on disaster response and community recovery initiatives, will have delayed checks and grants.

Housing agencies that depend on federal funds for operations and maintenance for property improvements by architects will be hindered, until the shutdown ends. In its contingency plan, the EPA outlines what agency activities will remain operational, namely emergency and disaster assistance, and Superfund response work.

Precarity at the federal level may likewise hinder access to loans from banks to developers for construction projects, Construction Drive reported. Private clients may be less likely to accept work with the public sector moving forward. Federal construction projects will be frozen temporarily and, in some cases, permanently.

Projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Highway Trust Fund, Federal Highway Administration, and Federal Transit Administration will likely not be impacted, because these have existing fixed-price contracts with appropriated funds.

Smithsonians, the National Gallery of Art, and other museums have contingency plans in place for shutdowns, because they rely on a mix of federal and private funds.

The National Museum of African American History will use prior funds to remain open to the public during the shut down, until October 6.

Memorials, like those dotting the National Mall, are likely to be unaffected, since they are on publicly accessible land.",https://www.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/adam-michael-szuscik-P8P-P0x7RkI-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 22:02:18.592176

Virtual power plants, Granholm added, could provide flexibility in managing data centers’ energy needs.
“If these huge data centers allow the local utility to use that data center to turn on the dimmer switch when they need more power, then the data center actually becomes a grid asset,” Granholm said.
Granholm mentioned that these data centers, if done correctly in partnership with communities, could also help accelerate the clean energy transition because clean energy is the fastest, lowest-cost option to bring these data centers online quickly.
“At this moment, wind and solar are the cheapest forms of energy in most places,” Granholm said.","Despite recent changes in federal policies, states and the private sector are making significant progress with wind and solar power deployment, which is a reason to be optimistic, former U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Sept. 30 during the Peter M. Wege Lecture on Sustainability.

Noting that there will be a rush to take advantage of existing tax credits before they expire, Granholm said there will be an acceleration of deployment for at least the next two years.

“Two weeks ago, the Solar Energy Industry Association put out a report saying that they expect that they will be deploying nearly 250 GW of solar by 2030,” said Granholm, who is also the former governor of Michigan. “The Hoover Dam equates to 2 gigawatts. So, we will have added to our nation’s electric grid by 2030, 125 GW or 125 solar dams worth of clean power, regardless of what is happening in the next 1,200 days.”

More than 800 people attended the 23rd annual Wege Lecture, U-M’s signature sustainability lecture series, at Rackham Auditorium. It was sponsored by the School for Environment and Sustainability, its Center for Sustainable Systems and the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.

The talk was moderated by Shalanda Baker, U-M’s inaugural vice provost for sustainability and climate action, whose questions included those submitted by attendees in advance. Baker and Granholm worked together in the Department of Energy.

Earlier in the day, Granholm met with small groups of SEAS and Ford School students and faculty for hour-long Q&A sessions.

In a wide-ranging conversation that focused on the progress toward and current challenges of achieving a clean energy future, Granholm said there’s a lot that could be done at the local level to make the cost of energy more affordable for people, such as “eliminating the soft costs associated with adding clean energy to one’s home or energy efficiency to one’s home.”

When asked about the hot topic of data centers, which many communities are saying no to because of their heavy water and energy consumption, Granholm said data centers could be an ally in driving more clean energy deployment, if the policies are structured to encourage utilities and data centers to work together on grid optimization and community benefit agreements.

Virtual power plants, Granholm added, could provide flexibility in managing data centers’ energy needs. “If these huge data centers allow the local utility to use that data center to turn on the dimmer switch when they need more power, then the data center actually becomes a grid asset,” Granholm said.

Granholm mentioned that these data centers, if done correctly in partnership with communities, could also help accelerate the clean energy transition because clean energy is the fastest, lowest-cost option to bring these data centers online quickly.

“At this moment, wind and solar are the cheapest forms of energy in most places,” Granholm said. “So if you are a data center and you want to go fast, and you want to go the least expensive, you are going to use clean energy and storage.”

She added: “I view this next wave of technology as being technology that will allow us to have free, abundant, clean energy so that we won’t have to have these conversations, and that our children and grandchildren will be able to focus on other ways of saving our civilization.”

When asked what’s most important for the next generation of climate leaders, Granholm said having a “warrior ethos for the planet” is important. She closed her talk with a rallying call to action and mentioned a prayer that U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi shared with her from her travels to South Africa.

“On the wall of a bishop’s office was a prayer. And the prayer goes, ‘when at last I stand before him, God will say, show me your wounds. And if I have no wounds, God will ask, was there nothing worth fighting for?’

“My hope is that we will bear the scars from the wounds that we have earned on behalf of the people on the planet,” Granholm said.",,N,,2025-10-01 22:01:29.947344

Ryan Libby, the director of subscriber acquisitions for solar farm operator PowerMarket, said work on the project is complete and is awaiting connection to ComEd’s power grid.
Should the school district become the anchor tenant, like the individual subscribers, it will receive a 50% discount on its ComEd bill for the power used.
A reduction in school district expenses would mean a break for property taxpayers.
“Together, we are turning yesterday’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities, rebuilding a stronger, more sustainable future for our residents.” District 60 Board of Education President Michael Rodriguez echoed Cunningham’s comments.","Approximately 1,000 Waukegan residents will likely pay nearly $400 a year less for electricity, and the city’s taxpayers who live within the boundaries of Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 may benefit as well, as the solar farm at the Yeoman Creek landfill becomes active.

A former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site, the 40-acre parcel — roughly bounded by Lewis, Sunset, Western and Glen Flora avenues — was useless to the district for nearly 60 years. Now, it contains 20,000 solar panels to be connected to Commonwealth Edison’s grid.

Ryan Libby, the director of subscriber acquisitions for solar farm operator PowerMarket, said work on the project is complete and is awaiting connection to ComEd’s power grid. The company takes energy from the farm and reduces the subscriber’s bill appropriately.

“The goal is to be fully operational by the end of the year,” Libby said. “This is exclusively for Waukegan residents due to the city’s status as an environmental justice community and the high percentage of low- to moderate-income families.”

PowerMarket completed the Yeoman Creek Community Solar Farm on Friday in Waukegan and continues to work with District 60 and others to register approximately 1,000 subscribers who will save an estimated $391 annually on their electric bills.

Libby said the savings come from a 50% discount on the power generated from the farm. The reduction is an estimate, and can be more or less depending on the amount of electricity used.

Along with the individual subscribers, Libby said plans also call for an “anchor tenant” to contract to use 40% of the power generated. Negotiations are ongoing for the major subscriber, but are not final yet.

“As of right now, I’m still waiting for the paperwork for the anchor agreement to come together,” he said. “The school (district) has expressed interest in enrolling some of its facilities as the anchor.”

Nick Alatzakis, District 60’s communications director, said the proposal is under review.

Should the school district become the anchor tenant, like the individual subscribers, it will receive a 50% discount on its ComEd bill for the power used. A reduction in school district expenses would mean a break for property taxpayers.

Waukegan Mayor Sam Cunningham said in an email that converting a one-time Superfund site and landfill into a productive use does more than create clean, renewable energy. The benefits go to low- and moderate-income families who need it most.

“It’s an investment in our people,” Cunningham said. “Together, we are turning yesterday’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities, rebuilding a stronger, more sustainable future for our residents.”

District 60 Board of Education President Michael Rodriguez echoed Cunningham’s comments. He sees both an immediate benefit and one that could last a long time. It helps the people who need it most.

“We took a property which had been a landfill for the city for a long time and turned it into something to benefit our city for years to come,” Rodriguez said.

So far, about 600 people have applied to subscribe. Libby said some applications are approved and others are in the review process. The school district is actively promoting the opportunity on its website, through texts and on social media, with approximately 1,000 openings available overall.

“We’re excited about this initiative because it helps households save on electricity bills while transforming district-owned land into a source of clean energy that benefits the entire community,” Alatzakis said.

If applicants live in a U.S. Census Tract — 68% of Waukegan residents do — where the majority of residents are considered low- to moderate-income, Libby said they merely need to provide a copy of a recent ComEd bill. The other 32% must show they are in the low- or moderate-income category.

To qualify, Libby said an individual must earn less than $67,150 annually, a couple can earn up to $76,750 and a family of four qualifies if total earnings are less than $95,900. Individuals can apply online or by phone.

The Chinese are leading the world in renewable energy production. Between January and May, China added 198 GW of solar and 46 GW of wind, enough to generate as much electricity as Indonesia or Turkey. As a result of the growing gap between the European and Chinese solar sectors, the EU has proposed several key measures that aim to reduce that gap.

SolarPower Europe has authored a study that highlights the gap between the European and Chinese solar sectors

Solar power is one of the most underrated energy generation processes in modern-day society. China, which is one of the most industrious nations in the world, has produced vast amounts of solar power since the nation opted to invest heavily in the sector. The EU has proposed several measures that aim to shrink the gap that exists in the sector.

SolarPower Europe partnered with the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems to conduct a study proposing urgent policies and measures that aim to shrink the cost gap between Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA)-compliant modules and Chinese-imported modules to below 10%.

Taking into account the undeniable fact that there remains a cost difference (2.2 to 5.8 €ct/Wp) between NZIA-compliant EU-made and NZIA-compliant non-EU modules, the study underscores the need for change in the solar sector in Europe, if they plan to compete with the ever-growing Chinese solar sector.

The low cost of producing solar power modules in China has exacerbated the gap in the sector

China is an extremely industrious nation; they have an unparalleled reputation for building massive projects for significantly less than any other nation could even imagine. As a result, they now lead the world in several sectors. The report from SolarPower Europe and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems reports that producing a solar module in Europe with EU-made solar cells costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China.

However, all is not lost for the European solar sector. The study finds that reaching the EU’s solar module manufacturing target of 30GW per year is both technically and economically achievable.

However, it underscores the need for the EU and its member states to take swift action if their lofty energy goals are to be reached. Improving the investment environment and subsidizing projects could assist in that regard. Solar has a growing impact on the energy sector in several nations and remains a vital decarbonization tool for the sector.

“This new report underlines that, with the right policies, Europe can competitively deliver 30 GW of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs and building a resilient, innovative solar supply chain that keeps economic value here at home. To meet the 2030 goal, the EU and Member States must act swiftly. Without interventions, Europe risks losing its remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar.” – Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe

In Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 20 years without a permanent license.
And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power.","For nearly a century, the Kelley’s Falls Dam in Manchester, New Hampshire, generated as much as 2,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year. When the small hydroelectric station in a downtown park came up for relicensing in 2022, its owners faced what many dam operators now expect when trying to extend the lifespan of these power generators: strict requirements that would force them to spend millions on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit. Instead, Green Mountain Power made a choice that has become common among hydroelectric operators. The utility simply surrendered its licenses.

Last year, the plant shut down.

Nearly 450 hydroelectric stations totaling more than 16 gigawatts of generating capacity are scheduled for relicensing across the United States over the next decade. That’s roughly 40% of the nonfederal fleet (the government owns about half the hydropower stations in the U.S.). The country is now on the verge of a major shift in hydropower. The facilities could be relicensed to supply the booming demand for electricity to power everything from data centers to aluminum smelters. Tech and industrial giants could even help pay for the costly relicensing process with deals like the record-setting $3 billion contract Google inked with hydropower operator Brookfield Asset Management in July for up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower. Or, as has been happening for years, the U.S. could continue to lose gigawatts of power as hydroelectric facilities shut down rather than absorb the high costs of relicensing — especially with cheaper competition from gas, wind, and solar.

The fleet of dams that helped electrify the nation starting in the late 1800s provides the second-largest share of the country’s renewable power after wind, and by far its most firm. But the average age of U.S. dams is 65 years, meaning the bulk of the fleet wasn’t built with newfangled infrastructure to enable unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife. As seen in New Hampshire, the cost of upgrading facilities to allow for that passage can soar into the tens of millions of dollars — on top of the expense of upgrading custom-built equipment for each plant. Complicating matters further, after decades of decline in the hydropower sector, the manufacturing muscle for turbines and other hardware that make a dam work has largely atrophied in the U.S.

The relicensing waiting game

The biggest obstacle to a hydropower comeback may be the relicensing bureaucracy. The problem is that the Federal Power Act — passed in 1920 to regulate hydroelectric facilities — does not give any single agency full authority over hydropower the way the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has over atomic energy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues the key permits on the national level, but other agencies also play a role. The Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, may require a National Environmental Policy Act review to examine a dam’s effects on a specific fish species, a process that involves assessing multiple spawning cycles. And once that’s done for salmon, the agency may undertake yet another multiyear study on trout. FERC, meanwhile, can’t issue its licenses until state agencies overseeing waterways approve permits. That alone can eat up years.

As a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That’s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity’s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)

“It takes longer to relicense an existing hydro facility than a new nuclear facility,” said Malcolm Woolf, the National Hydropower Association’s chief executive. ​“It takes just 18 months to get a new license for a nuclear plant.”

With no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process — eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.

“This is major infrastructure. These facilities cost billions of dollars,” Woolf said. ​“They’re like bridges and roads. They get a license for 50 years. The state agencies view [the relicensing process] as an opportunity to extract concessions from what they view as a deep pocket.”

At times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn’t even go to the plant.

“One … regulator was requiring a facility to pay for a feral-pig-eradication program,” Woolf said.

“In the 1970s, maybe the industry was a deep pocket,” he added. ​“But now, with the low cost of other fuels like wind and solar and gas, it’s driving these facilities to bankruptcy and to surrender licenses.”

The eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.

In Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 20 years without a permanent license. In Maryland, the Conowingo Dam’s relicensing process has also stretched on for two decades. In Massachusetts, the Northfield Mountain plant is in the middle of a 15-year permitting slog.

To continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. ​“But if they don’t have a long-term license,” Woolf warned, ​“they’re not about to invest millions in upgrades.”

One potential bright spot in the relicensing quagmire has been a shift in federal tax policy. For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80% of the plant’s market value into upgrades like new turbines or panels, making them eligible for bigger federal write-offs. In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department granted hydroelectric facilities the same flexibility.

But so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That’s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

“The question in the hydropower industry was, if you think of the Hoover Dam, is it 80% of the electric generating equipment? Or 80% of the whole Hoover Dam and the reservoir? So that’s what the Treasury clarified,” Woolf said. ​“It’s 80% of the electric generating equipment. So if you replace a 50-year-old generator with a new generator, you’re going to satisfy that.”

While renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1 executive orders on energy. In July, Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, preserving hydropower’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years. If a hydro project is built in a designated ​“energy community” and uses domestically manufactured equipment, the tax credit can cover as much as half the investment.

A fishy problem

Providing safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure. But dams that have been updated with newer, thinner turbine blades are also an issue, as the blades become guillotines for trout and salmon navigating through. American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish — which can make up as much as half the biomass in rivers across the country — migrate downstream to spawn as breeding-age adults.

One of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam’s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant’s water intake. Other methods include fish ladders or elevators that allow wildlife to ascend rising water to reach the other side. Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.

“Fish-passage solutions can be extraordinarily expensive,” said Jennifer Garson, the former director of the Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office. ​“The problem is the burden falls completely on hydropower operators to make these upgrades.”

The key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades. In 2019, the startup Natel Energy, which designs fish-safe hydropower turbines, installed its pilot project in Maine, then another in Oregon the following year. Natel’s technology — based on thicker blades that don’t sever fish as they move through the dam — was validated by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The company won $9 million from the Energy Department to scale up its supply chain.

While the fish-safe blades are thicker than traditional turbine blades, Natel claims that its equipment is more efficient than the older equipment it’s replacing. Compared with turbines that are nearly 40 years old, CEO Gia Schneider said, the new Natel units produce more electricity per spin on average.

“They’re going to modernize, get fish-safe turbines that will safely pass eel, salmon, and herring that need to go through the plant, and they’ll get 5% more energy,” Schneider said.

Even replacing newer blades comes with little loss in efficiency.

“At another plant where we’re working on the design, the turbines are pretty young – only installed 10 years ago,” she said. ​“There, we’re going to get maybe 0.2% less energy out.”

On balance, Schneider noted, plant owners get more out of the facility, because even with new traditional turbines, dams require very fine exclusion screens and other equipment that restrict water flow enough to reduce energy output by anywhere from 5% to 15%.

“You’re losing a lot more from these bolt-on solutions,” she said. ​“At the end of the day, if you get 0.2% less on the turbine side, … on the whole-plant level, you’re coming out ahead.”

Old hydropower, new opportunities

At the moment, hydropower finds itself in a similar position to that of nuclear energy a few years ago, where existing facilities risk closure due to relicensing costs amid competition from cheaper newcomers. The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam–size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.

Just 3% of the nation’s 80,000 dams generate electricity. In 2012, an Energy Department report found that the U.S. could add 12 gigawatts of new power by overhauling those facilities to produce electricity. More than a decade later, ​“none of it was built,” Woolf said.

There are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don’t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.

And in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up. Hydropower output in the American West hit a 22-year low last year after below-average snowfall, according to analysis by the Energy Information Administration. Yet other parts of the U.S., such as the Northeast, are getting wetter as the planet heats up.

While debate over hydropower continues in the U.S., nations overseas are moving ahead with new dam projects. In July, China started construction on what will, upon completion, be the world’s largest power station, a giant hydroelectric facility in Tibet. Last month, Brazil held its first auctions for new small- and medium-size dams with hopes of turning $1 billion in investments into more hydroelectricity. And Ethiopia just opened its megadam project meant to alleviate electricity issues in the country, despite pushback from Egyptians who say the facility could negatively impact the flow of water on the Nile.

The U.S. could get in on the game, or at least work to clear away hurdles preventing the country from taking advantage of the infrastructure that already exists. As the Trump administration looks to re-shore heavy industry through tariffs, Woolf said, ​“hydropower is a great resource for colocating manufacturing because you’ve got energy infrastructure and you’re typically in fairly rural areas where land is less expensive.” For data centers, reservoirs could offer the additional service of providing water for cooling hot computer servers, along with electricity. And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power. These plants could, in theory, play that role again as new demand for domestically produced aluminum — to manufacture electric vehicles and clean-energy equipment — puts strain on the remaining six smelters.

“We know we’ve got load growth. We know we’ve got grid variability from renewables and extreme weather. The flexibility of hydropower offers clean, firm generation that is unique,” Woolf said. ​“At the same time — through quirk of history — we’ve got so much of the fleet at relicensing and at risk of surrendering permits. This could be an amazing opportunity.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2223867427.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=fbd7efc175ab5b417b86ab5b0090bc17,N,,2025-10-01 23:00:13.105236

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America’s health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump’s boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it’s natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA’s furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet’s air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,” Ruckelshaus said. “Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA’s job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. “Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump’s new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,” followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America’s health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency’s shutdown plan

The EPA’s shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren’t funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won’t say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it’s 25% — but the Trump administration’s budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan’s presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency’s shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,” he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,” said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children’s health protection division.

Further, because the tech companies use electricity from the power grid, reliant on fossil-fuel-generated baseload power, they are not being powered 100% by renewable energy even with REC purchases. The letter explains that a contractual right to make a representation from an REC can still mislead consumers – just as if they had purchased the right to make a Made in the USA claim. And, for the same reasons, matching electricity consumption with unbundled RECs does not reduce emissions despite the companies’ claims. Rather, those companies have actually created emissions through the use of fuel-generated baseload power.

The AGs admit that the FTC’s Green Guides suggest renewable energy claims can be made using renewable energy certificate matches, but they argue that this language does not apply to emissions claims. And they further state that Green Guides are nonbinding and not preemptive –signaling these AGs intend to interpret their UDAP laws broader than the Green Guides at least in this instance.

The states also express concerns that the tech companies have both caused increased demand for electricity (including from AI products) while seeking to ​“lock up” nuclear power -- seeking to hook data centers directly to nuclear plants for energy. The AGs assert that rather than adding new green energy, this will deprive consumers of reliable energy, as wind and solar are not reliable. The emphasis companies put on renewable energy pressures utilities to move away from fossil-fuel-generated baseload power. This shift to shut down fossil fuel generation combined with increased energy needs of these companies ​“threaten[s] the integrity of the electric grid.”

The letter concludes with a list of 21 questions directed at all four companies requesting information on the purchases of unbundled RECs and how RECs support usage claims or reduced emissions claims.

There are multiple takeaways from this letter. First, this letter is the latest in the ongoing focus of state AGs on ​“big tech” and potential misrepresentations made by these companies. Second, companies should recognize that even where AGs may not have available pre-suit discovery tools, or may choose not to use those tools, AGs can use the power of the press release and informal letters to obtain relevant information. Finally, this action demonstrates a continued focus by Republican AGs in particular in ensuring adequate access to fossil fuel generated power. The crux of the AGs’ concern is that by misleading the public that they are 100% powered by renewable energy, these companies may drive the closure of coal and natural gas plants, threatening the power grid. Continued reliance on fossil fuels is a focal point of other challenges like the ongoing lawsuit against major investment firms alleging they used their ownership interest in the coal market to further green policy initiatives.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.kelleydrye.com/content/uploads/SEO-images/blog-defaults/adlawaccess.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 18:01:55.795750

And, the Bee Lab, a small but mighty department that helps research and protect bees, might lose its funding. If we want to have a fighting chance at saving the bees, we first need to save the Bee Lab.

What is the Bee Lab?

The Bee Lab is the only federal program that works to identify, study, and monitor American bee species.

Housed in the U.S. Geological Survey, the lab consists of two scientists working to understand bees, from their genetics to their ecological importance. However small, this duo has been the backbone of bee research for decades.

What does the Bee Lab do?

Nearly every bee researcher– and many advocates and conservationists– has relied on the lab for invaluable data. That’s because the Bee Lab is the only federal entity with the expertise to identify native bees.

The researchers catalogue and monitor over 4,000 bee species, studying their behavior and habitat needs. And, the Bee Lab documents species variations with stunning macro photographs.

To assist researchers, from students to scientists, the lab provides free online tools, including a database of all their activity that is open to public use. Around 500 publications have referenced it.

And, to study how bees interact with plants and other wildlife, the lab also cultivates a large and thriving pollinator garden that attracts bees, monarchs and many other species. It’s so successful that conservation groups, park departments, academics and more come to the garden to learn and to use samples native plants for their work.

Without the Bee Lab’s work, advocates and scientists will not have the resources they depend on to save the bees from extinction. Bees, wildlife and people will suffer without their work.

Why is it more important than ever to protect bees?

There are over 4,000 species of bees in the U.S, but because of habitat loss, pesticide use and more, they’ve been dying at unprecedented rates. Since 1947, the U.S. honeybee population has declined by 60%.

Bees are lynchpins of our ecosystems— they’re essential to so many other types of wildlife. They pollinate the flowers and trees that provide shelter and fruit to other species.

And, bees pollinate many of the agricultural crops we eat every day, like tomatoes and blueberries. The plight of bees poses a gigantic threat to the wildlife around us, but also the food that nourishes us. That’s where the Bee Lab comes in.

What we can do to save the Bee Lab

As we’ve pointed out to Congress for years, there’s a lot of wasteful spending in the federal government, but this small program is just not an example of that. The small investment in bee research is hugely important.

That’s why we’ve been sending messages to U.S. House Representatives urging them to save the Bee Lab. But we need your voice to make our message clear to them: pollinator research matters, and we will not let the bees die.

AI servers are so power hungry that utilities are keeping coal-fired power plants that were slated for closure running to meet the needs of massive servers. And in the South alone, there are plans for 20 gigawatts of new natural-gas power plants over the next 15 years — enough to power millions of homes — just to feed AI’s energy needs.

Multi-billion dollar companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta that previously committed to 100 percent renewable energy are going back to the Jurassic Age, using fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to meet their insatiable energy needs. Even nuclear power plants are being reactivated to meet the needs of power-hungry servers.

At a time when we need all corporations to reduce their climate footprint, carbon emissions from major tech companies in 2023 have skyrocketed to 150 percent of average 2020 values.

AI data centers also produce massive noise pollution and use huge amounts of water. Residents near data centers report that the sound keeps them awake at night and their taps are running dry.

Many of us live in communities that either have or will have a data center, and we’re already feeling the effects. Many of these plants further burden communities already struggling with a lack of economic investment, access to basic resources, and exposure to high levels of pollution.

To add insult to injury, amid stagnant wages and increasing costs for food, housing, utilities, and consumer goods, AI’s demand for power is also raising electric rates for customers nationwide. To meet the soaring demand for energy that AI data servers demand, utilities need to build new infrastructure, the cost of which is being passed onto all customers.

A recent Carnegie Mellon study found that AI data centers could increase electric rates by 25 percent in Northern Virginia by 2030. And NPR recently reported that AI data centers were a key driver in electric rates increasing twice as fast as the cost of living nationwide — at a time when one in six households are struggling to pay their energy bills.

All of these impacts are only projected to grow. AI already consumes enough electricity to power 7 million American homes. By 2028, that could jump to the amount of power needed for 22 percent of all US households.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

AI could be powered by renewable energy that is non-polluting and works to reduce energy costs for us all. The leading AI companies, who have made significant climate pledges, must lead the way.

Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta have all made promises to the communities they serve to tackle climate and pollution. They all have climate pledges. And they have made significant investments in renewable energy in the past.

Those investments make sense, since renewables are the most affordable form of electricity. These companies have the know-how and the wealth to power AI with wind, solar, and batteries — which makes it all the more puzzling that they’re relying on fossil fuels to power the future.

If these corporate giants are to be good neighbors, they first need to be open and honest about the scope and scale of the problem and the solutions needed.

As these companies invest billions in technology for AI, they must re-up investments in renewables to power our future and protect our communities. They must ensure that communities have a real voice in how and where AI data centers are built — and that our communities aren’t sacrificed in the name of profits.

The reintroduction of federal coal lease auctions represents a significant shift in US energy policy, offering nearly 600 million tons of recoverable coal across four states. These auctions serve as a critical test for measuring industry interest in expanding coal operations amid changing energy markets and environmental concerns.

The Trump administration's decision to resume coal leasing on federal lands marks a sharp reversal from previous policies. With sales scheduled in Alabama, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming, these auctions represent the first substantial offering of federal coal resources in years and provide insight into whether policy support can revitalize a sector that has experienced significant decline.

According to Energy Information Administration data, US coal production dropped 40% between 2013 and 2023, while federal acreage under coal mining leases decreased by 11% during the same period. This decline occurred primarily due to competition from natural gas and increased mining permitting fundamentals under previous administrations.

Current Coal Market Context

The federal competitive leasing program's revival comes after years of restrictions. Under the Biden administration, new coal leases on federal lands were largely halted, creating a backlog of applications from companies seeking to expand their operations.

One of the most significant changes supporting this revival is the reduction in royalty rates from the previous 8-12.5% to a flat 7% following recent tax law changes. This reduction aims to improve project economics and encourage mining companies to bid on new leases.

Industry experts see these auctions as a critical indicator of whether policy support can translate into renewed investment in coal resources. The outcome of these sales will likely influence future federal energy leasing decisions and broader resource development strategies.

What Coal Resources Are Being Offered in the 2025 Auctions?

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is conducting a series of competitive sales across multiple states, each targeting specific coal reserves with varying characteristics and potential applications. The combined offering represents approximately 586.8 million tons of recoverable coal, ranging from high-value metallurgical coal for steel production to thermal coal for electricity generation.

Alabama Metallurgical Coal Tracts

The auctions begin on October 1, 2025, with the offer of two leases in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. These leases cover underground mining rights beneath 14,050 acres (5,686 hectares) of private land and are estimated to contain 53 million tons of metallurgical coal primarily used in steelmaking.

These valuable coal deposits are adjacent to existing operations owned by Warrior Met Coal, which first applied to lease these additional areas back in 2009, highlighting the lengthy timeline often associated with federal resource leasing.

Metallurgical (or ""met"") coal represents a premium segment of the coal market, as its properties make it essential for steel production. Unlike thermal coal, which faces competition from renewable energy sources, metallurgical coal has fewer substitutes in industrial applications.

Utah Thermal Coal Offering

Following the Alabama sale, the BLM will auction the Little Eccles Tract in Emery County, Utah on October 2, 2025. This smaller offering spans just 120 acres but contains an estimated 1.29 million tons of recoverable coal.

The tract's location adjacent to Canyon Fuel Company's Skyline mine creates operational synergies that could make this modest reserve economically attractive. The company specifically requested this tract to extend the life of its existing operation.

Utah's coal industry has historically been more resilient than other regions, benefiting from both thermal coal markets and some specialty coal applications. The state's coal typically offers higher heat content compared to other western US deposits.

Montana and Wyoming Large-Scale Offerings

The most substantial coal resources in this auction series are located in Montana and Wyoming, representing the heart of the Powder River Basin—America's most productive coal region.

On October 6, 2025, the BLM will offer 1,262 acres in Montana with an expected 167.5 million tons of recoverable coal. This will be followed by an even larger Wyoming auction on October 8, offering 3,508 acres containing an estimated 365 million tons.

Both tracts were requested by Navajo Transitional Energy Company (NTEC), which is owned by the Navajo Nation and already operates mines in these areas. NTEC's participation highlights the complex economic interests at play, as tribal enterprises seek to develop resources that provide revenue and employment opportunities for their communities.

Combined, these Montana and Wyoming tracts contain over 532 million tons of recoverable coal—approximately 90% of the total coal resources being offered in this auction series.

How Does the Administration Plan to Revitalize the Coal Sector?

The federal government has implemented a multi-pronged approach to support coal industry expansion, focusing on both regulatory changes and financial incentives. This strategy represents a significant shift from previous administrations' policies toward coal and fossil fuel development on federal lands.

Regulatory Framework Changes

Central to the administration's approach is streamlined permitting for new and expanded mining operations. This includes expedited review processes and reduced administrative barriers that previously extended the timeline for lease approvals.

Perhaps the most impactful change is the reduction in royalty rates from the previous range of 8-12.5% to a flat 7% rate. This adjustment, enabled through tax legislation passed earlier in 2025, directly improves project economics for potential bidders by reducing the ongoing payment obligations to the federal government.

The renewed access to federal lands previously unavailable for coal leasing represents another key pillar of the strategy. By reopening areas that were effectively off-limits under the previous administration's policies, the government has expanded the potential resource base available to coal producers.

Environmental assessment requirements for certain projects have also been modified to accelerate approvals while still maintaining required regulatory oversight, according to administration officials.

Financial Support Mechanisms

Beyond regulatory changes, the administration has committed ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" to support coal-fired power plant development and upgrades. This investment aims to ensure that domestic coal production has sufficient demand from electricity generators.

Tax incentives for domestic coal production and utilization further enhance the economic attractiveness of coal mining operations. These incentives are designed to improve competitiveness relative to other energy sources and imported coal.

Infrastructure investment supporting coal transportation networks—including rail improvements and port facilities—addresses logistical bottlenecks that have hampered some coal operations. Efficient transportation is particularly critical for coal, which has relatively high weight-to-value ratios compared to other commodities.

Research funding for advanced coal technologies and decarbonisation in mining also forms part of the strategy, seeking to address environmental concerns while maintaining coal's role in the energy mix. This includes support for carbon capture and storage technologies that could potentially reduce coal's carbon footprint.

What Is the Expected Industry Response to These Auctions?

Industry representatives and market analysts have expressed varying perspectives on the potential success of these auctions and their ability to revitalize the coal sector. While some anticipate strong interest driven by policy support, others point to persistent market challenges that could limit participation.

Industry Optimism

The National Mining Association has projected confidence in the upcoming sales. Their spokesperson Ashley Burke stated: ""With energy needs only accelerating, and an administration in place that properly values reliable, affordable fuel sources, American coal producers are well positioned to make the most of new leasing opportunities to answer the call for increased domestic coal.""

Companies with adjacent operations have particular incentive to participate in these auctions. Warrior Met Coal's interest in the Alabama tracts would allow them to expand their metallurgical coal production without the costs of developing entirely new mine infrastructure. Similarly, Canyon Fuel Company's interest in the Utah tract would extend the life of their existing Skyline operation.

The participation of Navajo Transitional Energy Company in requesting the Montana and Wyoming tracts demonstrates tribal economic development interest in coal resources. For the Navajo Nation, coal mining represents a significant source of jobs and revenue that supports essential services for tribal members.

Market Challenges

Despite policy support, the coal industry continues to face significant challenges that may influence auction participation. Competition from natural gas remains intense, with gas-fired generation often displacing coal in electricity markets due to cost advantages and operational flexibility.

The ongoing decline in coal-fired electricity generation capacity nationwide presents a fundamental demand challenge. As older coal plants retire without replacement, the domestic market for thermal coal continues to shrink, potentially limiting interest in new reserves.

International market pressures and fluctuating demand for thermal coal add another layer of uncertainty. While export markets provide opportunities for some US coal producers, they also introduce exposure to global price volatility and competition from major exporters like Australia and Indonesia.

Rising renewable energy deployment and cost competitiveness further complicates the long-term outlook for coal. As wind, solar, and battery storage technologies continue to advance, their role in electricity generation expands, potentially limiting coal's future market share.

What Environmental Concerns Surround the Coal Leasing Program?

The renewed coal leasing initiative has drawn criticism from environmental organizations concerned about climate impacts and ecological consequences. These groups argue that expanding coal production contradicts climate goals and risks creating stranded assets as the energy transition progresses.

Climate Impact Considerations

Environmental advocates have expressed alarm about the long-term implications of new coal leases. Emma Yip, attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, warned the leases are ""really only working to prop up a dying industry by locking in coal reserves that won't even be mined until we're well into the second half of the century.""

This criticism highlights concerns about long-term carbon emissions from newly leased reserves. Since federal coal leases typically last 20 years and can be extended as long as commercial production continues, resources leased today could be mined for decades, potentially conflicting with future emissions reduction targets.

Questions about alignment with international climate commitments have also emerged. Critics argue that expanding fossil fuel production on federal lands contradicts broader policy goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with international agreements.

The potential for stranded assets represents another concern as the global energy transition continues. If market conditions or policy environments change significantly in coming years, companies investing in new coal leases today could face challenges recovering their investments.

Environmental Review Process

Despite streamlining efforts, leases remain subject to federal environmental assessments. These reviews evaluate potential impacts on air and water quality, wildlife habitat, cultural resources, and other environmental factors before final approvals are granted.

Public comment periods remain required before final approvals, allowing community members, environmental groups, and other stakeholders to provide input on proposed leases. These comments must be considered and addressed in final decision documents.

State and federal permitting requirements still apply beyond the lease issuance itself. Mining operations must secure additional permits addressing specific environmental protections, mine reclamation innovation plans, and operational constraints.

Ongoing legal challenges to regulatory changes add another layer of complexity and uncertainty to the leasing process. Several environmental organizations have filed or threatened litigation challenging aspects of the revived leasing program, potentially affecting implementation timelines.

How Does Coal Fit Into America's Changing Energy Landscape?

The coal industry's position in the US energy mix continues to evolve amid competing priorities and technological changes. While some advocate for coal's continued role in providing reliable baseload power, others point to its declining share in electricity generation and environmental impacts.

Energy Security Arguments

Administration officials have cited the need for reliable baseload power generation as a key justification for supporting coal. Unlike some intermittent renewable sources, coal plants can operate continuously and predictably, providing stability to the electrical grid.

Concerns about grid stability during extreme weather events have intensified following several high-profile power disruptions in recent years. Coal advocates argue that maintaining fuel diversity, including coal capacity, enhances resilience during periods of stress on the energy system.

Domestic resource utilization reducing foreign energy dependence represents another security-focused argument for maintaining coal production. The abundant domestic coal reserves provide an energy source not subject to international supply disruptions or price manipulation.

Coal stockpiles provide an energy security buffer that few other generation sources can match. The ability to store substantial fuel reserves on-site at coal plants offers protection against supply chain disruptions that might affect natural gas or petroleum-based generation.

Artificial Intelligence and Electricity Demand

One of the newest arguments for maintaining coal capacity centers on growing electricity demand from data centers and AI applications. These facilities require enormous amounts of reliable electricity, with some large AI computing centers consuming as much power as small cities.

The debate over meeting peak load requirements with intermittent renewables has intensified as electricity demand forecasts have been revised upward. Some analysts question whether renewable deployment can scale quickly enough to meet this growing demand without maintaining conventional generation capacity, including coal.

This growing demand has sparked renewed debate over the appropriate energy mix for reliability and sustainability. Coal industry representatives argue that premature retirement of coal assets could leave the grid vulnerable to supply shortfalls as electricity demand accelerates.

Coal is increasingly positioned as a potential solution for baseload power needs in this high-growth scenario. Proponents argue that its reliable generation profile and abundant domestic supplies make it well-suited to support the expansion of data centers and AI applications, particularly in regions where renewable resources are less abundant.

What Economic Impacts Could Result From Expanded Coal Mining?

The economic implications of coal lease expansion extend beyond the mining companies to affect local communities, government revenues, and broader economic sectors. These impacts vary significantly by region and depend on the scale of development that ultimately occurs.

Community Economic Benefits

Potential job creation in rural mining communities represents one of the most frequently cited benefits of coal development. Mining jobs typically offer higher wages compared to other available employment in rural areas, with positions often paying $70,000-$100,000 annually including benefits.

Tax revenue generation for local governments provides funding for essential services like schools, roads, and public safety. In many rural counties with significant mining activity, resource taxes form a substantial portion of the local government budget.

Indirect economic activity through supply chains and services creates a multiplier effect, with each direct mining job typically supporting multiple additional positions in transportation, equipment supply, maintenance services, and local retail and hospitality businesses.

Infrastructure development in mining regions often accompanies major coal projects. Companies frequently invest in road improvements, railroad spurs, water systems, and other infrastructure that can benefit the broader community beyond the mine itself.

Revenue Generation

Federal royalty payments at the newly established 7% rate will generate ongoing revenue throughout the production life of leased resources. These payments are based on the value of coal produced and represent a direct financial return to taxpayers from public resources.

Bonus bids during competitive lease sales provide immediate upfront revenue. These one-time payments, which can range from thousands to millions of dollars depending on the tract's size and quality, are made by the winning bidder to secure the lease rights.

State severance taxes on coal production create another revenue stream that directly benefits state budgets. These taxes vary by state but typically range from 2-10% of production value, funding education, infrastructure, and other state priorities.

Local property and sales tax benefits accrue from both mining operations themselves and the economic activity they generate. Property taxes on mining equipment and facilities provide steady revenue to local governments, while increased commercial activity boosts sales tax collections.

How Are International Coal Markets Influencing US Production Decisions?

Global coal market dynamics significantly impact the economic viability of US coal production and export opportunities. International demand, price trends, and competition from other major producing countries all influence domestic production decisions and investment in new leases.

Export Market Opportunities

Metallurgical coal demand for global steel production represents the most valuable export opportunity for US coal producers. Premium US met coal commands higher prices in international markets, particularly in regions with growing steel industries like Asia and parts of Europe.

Thermal coal exports to countries expanding coal-fired generation, particularly in Asia and parts of Africa, offer additional market opportunities. While environmental policies in many developed nations are reducing coal use, several developing economies continue to build new coal capacity.

Competition with major coal exporters like Australia, Indonesia, and Russia presents challenges for US producers. These countries often have lower production costs, more favorable transportation logistics to key Asian markets, or specific quality advantages for certain applications.

Shipping costs and logistics significantly affect competitiveness in international markets. US coal faces higher transportation costs to reach Asian markets compared to Australian or Indonesian suppliers, creating a structural disadvantage that must be overcome through quality premiums or other factors.

Global Policy Considerations

International climate policies affecting coal demand trajectories create uncertainty for long-term investment decisions. As more countries implement carbon pricing, emissions limits, or other climate policies, the outlook for coal demand becomes increasingly complex and regionally differentiated.

Energy transition timelines varying by region and country create a patchwork of market opportunities and risks. While some developed economies have established clear coal phase-out timelines, other regions anticipate continued or even expanded coal use for decades.

Coal phase-out commitments in developed economies, particularly in Europe and parts of North America, have reduced traditional export markets for US coal. These policy-driven changes have forced producers to seek alternative customers in emerging markets.

Growing coal consumption in developing Asian markets, particularly India and Southeast Asian nations, partially offsets declining demand elsewhere. These economies continue to build new coal-fired generation capacity to meet rising electricity demand, creating potential export opportunities for US producers.

What Does the Future Hold for Federal Coal Leasing?

The long-term outlook for federal coal leasing remains uncertain, with multiple factors potentially influencing its trajectory. Political, market, technological, and policy considerations will all shape the future landscape for coal development on public lands.

Policy Stability Questions

Potential for policy reversals under future administrations creates significant uncertainty for long-term investment decisions. The history of oscillating energy policies between administrations makes companies cautious about commitments that might span multiple presidential terms.

Legal challenges to regulatory changes could modify or delay implementation of the current leasing program. Environmental organizations have filed lawsuits challenging various aspects of federal coal policy, and court decisions could significantly impact how the program proceeds.

Congressional oversight and legislative actions may also influence the program's direction. Changes in congressional control could lead to new legislation affecting coal leasing, mining regulations, climate policy, or other factors relevant to coal development.

State-level energy and environmental policies create another layer of complexity, as states maintain substantial authority over mining permits, water quality regulations, and other aspects of coal development regardless of federal leasing policies.

Market Evolution Factors

Long-term electricity demand growth projections will substantially influence coal's future role. If electricity consumption accelerates dramatically due to AI, data centers, and electrification of transportation and heating, the pressure to maintain diverse generation sources, including coal, may increase.

Renewable energy cost trajectories and deployment rates continue to improve, potentially further eroding coal's market position. If solar, wind, and storage technologies maintain their historical cost reduction trends, they may increasingly outcompete coal generation on purely economic grounds.

Natural gas price forecasts and production trends represent another critical variable. Should natural gas prices rise significantly from current levels, coal's competitiveness in electricity markets could improve, potentially increasing interest in new coal resources.

Carbon capture technology development and deployment could dramatically alter coal's environmental profile and market prospects. If these technologies become economically viable at scale, they could enable continued coal use while addressing climate concerns, potentially extending the life of the coal industry.

FAQ: US Coal Auctions and Mining Policy

How much coal is being offered in the current federal auctions?

The current auctions across Alabama, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming include approximately 586.8 million tons of recoverable coal resources. The largest portions are in Wyoming (365 million tons) and Montana (167.5 million tons), with smaller amounts in Alabama (53 million tons) and Utah (1.29 million tons).

These resources range from metallurgical coal used in steelmaking to thermal coal for electricity generation, representing diverse quality characteristics and potential applications. The total offering would support multiple decades of mining at typical production rates.

Who can participate in federal coal lease auctions?

Qualified coal mining companies, including both domestic and foreign-owned entities operating in the US, can participate in the competitive bidding process. Participants must meet financial and operational qualification requirements established by the Bureau of Land Management to ensure they have the capability to develop the resources responsibly.

Companies must demonstrate financial solvency, technical capability to develop the resource, and compliance with various legal requirements. The BLM evaluates these qualifications before allowing companies to participate in the auction process.

What happens to the money generated from coal lease sales?

Revenue from coal lease sales includes both upfront bonus bids and ongoing royalty payments (currently 7% of production value). These funds are typically split between the federal government and the state where the coal is located, with states receiving approximately 50% of the proceeds in most cases.

The federal portion funds various government programs, while the state share typically supports education, infrastructure, and other public services. This revenue-sharing arrangement provides direct financial benefits to coal-producing states from resources developed within their boundaries.

How long do coal leases typically last?

Federal coal leases generally have an initial term of 20 years and can be extended as long as the lease is producing coal in commercial quantities. Companies must meet diligent development requirements, typically beginning production within 10 years of lease issuance, to maintain their lease rights.

If commercial production ceases for an extended period, the lease may be subject to termination. This structure encourages timely development of leased resources while allowing for long-term operations once production begins.

What environmental reviews are required before mining can begin?

Even after obtaining a lease, companies must complete extensive environmental impact assessments, secure mining permits from state and federal agencies, develop reclamation plans, and address potential impacts to water, air, wildlife, and cultural resources before mining operations can commence.

These processes typically involve multiple regulatory agencies, public comment periods, and detailed technical studies. The requirements ensure that environmental considerations are thoroughly evaluated and appropriate mitigation measures are implemented before ground-disturbing activities begin.

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) establishes minimum federal standards for coal mining operations and reclamation, while state regulatory programs often impose additional requirements specific to local conditions. Together, these regulations govern how mining activities are conducted and how disturbed areas are restored after mining is complete.

The evolution of mining trends continues to influence how these operations are managed, with increasing focus on sustainability and minimizing environmental impacts throughout the mining lifecycle.

The context makes it worse. Here’s what Wright said: “Texas has the fastest rising wholesale electricity prices of any region in the country, 100 percent rise in wholesale prices from the start of the Biden administration to today.”

That is objectively false.

The fastest rising wholesale costs of any region?! Has he heard of PJM?

Here are some facts, which one would hope the Secretary of Energy would have access to:

According to ERCOT’s Independent Market Monitor, adjusted for inflation, wholesale prices in 2024 were lower than 2020, which was the COVID year. To repeat, not only are prices not up 100% from 4-5 years ago, they are actually lower.

There were three high-priced years: 2021 (due to Winter Storm Uri), 2022 (due to higher gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine), and 2023 (due to the second-hottest summer in recorded Texas history and a dearth of solar and batteries to provide electricity during peak and net peak periods, respectively).

Costs in 2024 – Texas’ sixth-hottest summer – were 50% lower than 2023. It was, according to ERCOT and the IMM, one of the lowest-cost years in the history of the Texas market.

Don’t take my word for it. Here’s the Independent Market Monitor’s data:

And 2025 is shaping up to be another year of relatively low wholesale electricity costs in Texas. As the Energy Information Agency has shown, wholesale prices in ERCOT have been far lower than the national average each of the last two summers:

And the cost of ancillary services this summer were stunningly low, mostly due to batteries:

Wright can hate renewables; it doesn’t make sense but that’s his right. But he can’t – or at the very least shouldn’t – misinform or mislead the public.

Outdated Thinking

Here’s more from Wright last week:

“So the electricity grid doesn’t just collect electrons and store them somewhere. It has to match supply and demand at every second.”

That is an actual quote from the Secretary of Energy of the United States of America – who apparently isn’t aware that batteries exist.

Battery storage was absolutely essential this summer in helping Texas avoid price spikes and energy emergencies, as the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, Houston Chronicle, and others have reported in recent weeks.

Over just a couple of years, battery storage resources on the ERCOT grid have scaled at a staggering pace: Texas now has enough battery capacity to equal 15% of peak demand; it’ll be nearly 20% by the end of the year.

And that’s just utility-scale – there’s another gigawatt of distributed storage in homes and garages across the state, plus 20 gigawatts more rolling around in electric vehicles; with the right price signals, EV batteries also could be deployed to the grid in times of scarcity, as stationary storage is doing today.

The phenomenal growth of battery storage resources are transforming grids around the world. In the ERCOT market, operators are storing up low-cost power – including but not limited to renewables – every day. That power is then available when demand is high and supply is scarce.

ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas told me batteries are one of the most “innovative things that has happened to the electric grid since the invention of the electric grid.”

Batteries increase grid reliability and resiliency while lowering costs.

The Secretary of Energy, of all people, should know that we can, in fact, store power now.

Costs, Costs, Costs

Across the country, energy inflation is weighing on consumers and slowing the economy. Wright himself has said it’s a liability for the Administration.

But he’s taking a bad situation and making it worse.

Study after study has demonstrated the role that Texas’ nation-leading renewables are playing in containing energy costs. Studies released this spring – amid a fusillade of baffling anti-energy attacks in the Texas Legislature – showed that shutting down renewables in Texas would dramatically increase the risk of blackouts and increase wholesale market costs in ERCOT by $115 billion over 15 years.

Another study showed that the Administration’s anti-energy actions could make Texas businesses’ power costs go up 54%.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is among the many voices urging the Trump Administration to end its attacks on renewables: “ America needs every possible electron it can get, from any source, to ensure affordable and reliable energy,” the Chamber declared last month.

That’s because employers have to live in the real world, where AI and data centers are helping to drive demand ever higher and consumers are dealing with rising costs and energy inflation.

Secretary Wright should join us in that real world where wholesale power prices in Texas are the lowest they’ve been in a long time. Texas has a diverse resource mix that’s working.

Secretary Wright shouldn’t mess with Texas, especially with made up stats.

After years of battling misguided, top-down mandates from California regulators, common sense prevailed, freeing fleets, manufacturers, and drivers to pursue real, sustainable progress in reducing emissions.

For too long, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) attempted to dictate national policy by isolating industries, coercing manufacturers, and imposing one-size-fits-all solutions. The 2023 Clean Truck Partnership (CTP) was a prime example: a regulatory straitjacket that sought to strip companies of their rights, destabilize supply chains, and force fleets down an uneconomic path toward electric trucks that were unready for prime time.

That chapter is now closed. In a bipartisan victory for both the environment and the economy, Congress and President Trump revoked California’s special waivers and reaffirmed that EPA—not Sacramento—sets America’s emissions standards. With that, the CTP collapsed, restoring a level playing field and clearing the way for the trucking industry to continue advancing proven, practical solutions.

And the wins didn’t stop there. This summer, truck manufacturers including Daimler, International, Paccar, and Volvo formally walked away from the CTP, rejecting coercion and recommitting to working with their customers on technologies that actually work. This decision is already paying dividends: carriers once again have confidence that their investments in equipment will be grounded in sound science and market realities.

While CARB clings to ideology, the trucking industry continues to deliver results:

Clean Diesel Leadership: Thanks to decades of innovation, today’s trucks are 99% cleaner for particulate matter and NOx emissions than those built decades ago. Sixty new trucks today emit as much as just one truck did in 1988.

SmartWay Success: Since 2004, the EPA’s voluntary SmartWay program has helped carriers save more than four billion gallons of fuel, reduce 379 million barrels of oil consumption, and slash carbon emissions, all without mandates.

Phase 1 & 2 Standards: Supported by ATA, these commonsense fuel efficiency regulations are projected to reduce oil consumption by 2.5 billion barrels, saving the industry $220 billion in fuel costs between 2014 and 2027 and cutting CO2 emissions by 1.37 billion metric tons.

Promising Alternatives: Renewable diesel is already proving to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions more effectively than electric trucks at a fraction of the cost and without the infrastructure challenges.

Other Major Wins for Trucking and the Environment

The summer of 2025 also delivered two other big victories for environmental progress:

Proposed Repeal of the Federal EV Truck Mandate: The Biden-era “Phase 3” rule would have forced fleets into electric trucks regardless of cost or feasibility. Its proposed repeal, if enacted, will be a victory for common sense. This decision ensures that emissions standards are based on what’s achievable and effective, not political ideology.

Fixing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Guidance: EPA’s move to address DEF system failures was another example of practical policymaking. Previously, these failures could trigger dramatic engine derates, stranding trucks and disrupting supply chains. We’re thankful to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for recognizing the problem and delivering a solution that keeps trucks moving while protecting the environment.

The message from this summer is clear: when government respects the role of markets, innovation, and collaboration, the trucking industry delivers. Environmental progress does not come from coercion or ideology. It comes from empowering fleets and manufacturers to do what they’ve always done: drive America forward with cleaner, more efficient technology.

As we turn the page on the CTP and California’s failed experiment in government expansionism, we remain committed to protecting the environment, strengthening the economy, and ensuring that common sense rather than bureaucratic overreach guides us forward.",https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/styles/featured_image/public/2023-12/Energy%20and%20Environment.jpg?h=56a25956&itok=1itCXci1,N,,2025-10-01 18:02:15.263606

In Detail : India’s solar manufacturing sector saw significant growth in the first half of 2025, adding 44.2 GW of module capacity and 7.5 GW of cell production. This surge is fueled by a strong 186 GW project pipeline planned through 2027 and ambitious government targets for 2030, highlighting the country’s commitment to expanding domestic solar capabilities and supporting renewable energy transition.

TOPCon technology dominated the new module additions, contributing 39.9 GW, followed by 3 GW of monocrystalline modules. For the first time, heterojunction (HJT) module capacity of 1.2 GW was introduced, reflecting India’s push toward advanced, high-efficiency solar technologies to meet both domestic and export demand.

As of June 2025, 91.5 GW of module production and 13.1 GW of cell production had received ALMM certification, ensuring compliance with India’s domestic manufacturing policies. These certifications aim to support local manufacturing, encourage investment, and align with the government’s vision of building a robust domestic solar supply chain over the next decade.

Indian manufacturers currently have 182 GW of module capacity and 86 GW of cell capacity under construction, scheduled for commissioning by 2027. Additionally, 97 GW of modules and 84.7 GW of cell capacity have been announced for future expansion, expected to come online by 2030 or earlier, demonstrating long-term planning and commitment.

India imported 44.6 GW of solar modules and cells in H1 2025, with cells accounting for 66% and modules 34% of the imports. Despite rising domestic manufacturing, the sector remains dependent on imports for raw materials like polysilicon, highlighting the need to scale up local production and reduce supply chain vulnerabilities.

Exports remained modest, with nearly 3 GW of modules and 83 MW of cells shipped primarily to the United States. However, U.S. tariffs of 50% on Indian solar panels have affected export volumes, creating challenges for manufacturers who previously relied on overseas markets to absorb production capacity and drive technology upgrades.

Many Indian factories are currently operating at just 25% of their total capacity, indicating underutilization despite rapid capacity additions. This gap underscores the importance of policy support, investment incentives, and infrastructure development to fully realize the country’s solar manufacturing potential and achieve efficiency gains.

Government initiatives, clean energy mandates, and domestic procurement policies are playing a critical role in sustaining growth. Incentives and regulatory frameworks are encouraging manufacturers to expand, adopt advanced technologies, and compete with global players while contributing to India’s climate and energy goals.

Looking ahead, India aims to reach 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with nearly 170 GW of projects already underway. The next few years will be crucial as the country strengthens its domestic solar manufacturing base, reduces import dependency, and solidifies its position as a major player in the global clean energy transition.",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Solar-Manufacturing5.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 19:01:44.779414

Climate change is the biggest threat facing our ocean. Every day we see its alarming effects on ocean ecosystems and coastal communities: intense ocean heat waves, coral reefs bleaching, melting sea ice, habitat changes, sea life population declines and devastating damage due to stronger and more frequent hurricanes. Each one is a grave reminder that to protect our ocean, we must address climate change. Our most promising strategy is to transition away from harmful oil and gas to responsible clean energy.

Luckily, ocean-based climate solutions can help solve the climate crisis. According to the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy the ocean has the potential to contribute as much as one-third of the annual greenhouse gas emission cuts needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C., through restoring coastal and marine ecosystems, decarbonizing maritime transportation, scaling marine renewable energy and others.

The most significant of these opportunities is ending fossil fuels and shifting to clean ocean energy.

At Ocean Conservancy, we believe a responsible, rapid and just transition to the ocean as a source of 100% clean energy by 2050 is both possible and essential. Through science-based research, smart policy, accessible finance and global collaboration, we can create a better future—one where our ocean is healthy, marine wildlife is resilient and protected from climate change, and clean ocean energy supports our country’s energy needs while providing good paying jobs with cleaner air and water for all.

Let’s change course

Protecting the ocean, us and our planet from climate change will take a comprehensive shift away from harmful oil and gas to responsible clean ocean energy. This transition will require coordinated, long-term strategies including: responsible planning, with no future oil and gas leases, a global reduction in plastic production, and smart structuring of offshore wind development to be safe for marine life; a reconfiguration of ocean energy financing, including phasing out oil and gas subsidies, and mobilizing funding for marine renewable energy; and smart end-of-life processes for infrastructure in the ocean are safer and more accountable.

She’s now working as a cybersecurity defense analyst on their global cybersecurity incident response team out of Houston, Texas.
“Chevron is an energy company, and energy runs America.
Cybersecurity is incredibly important in the energy industry and has a larger role in that than you might think.
She also served as vice president of the Society of Women Engineers and as fundraising chair for Women in Computer Science.","Meet Arushi Ghildiyal who recently graduated from LSU with a degree in cybersecurity at 20 years old and is now working for one of the nation’s best cybersecurity teams at Chevron.

Last year around this time, LSU alumna Arushi Ghildiyal from Dallas, Texas, walked into her first hardcore hacking class at LSU, Software Vulnerabilities and Exploitation. There, she realized her passion for what’s known in the cybersecurity world as “red-teaming,” or going on offense to find weaknesses in networks, software, and hardware. Even before graduating with her bachelor’s degree in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity from LSU in May, Ghildiyal was hired by Chevron. She’s now working as a cybersecurity defense analyst on their global cybersecurity incident response team out of Houston, Texas.

“I returned to the same company I interned with last summer, so I knew it’s a place where I want to work,” Ghildiyal said. “Chevron is an energy company, and energy runs America. Cybersecurity is incredibly important in the energy industry and has a larger role in that than you might think. If an attacker shuts down the energy industry, they shut down a lot of things for a lot of people—a lot could go wrong.”

“We work with Chevron’s team at Volexity and they are insanely skilled. The fact we have a student there fulltime right out of school is crazy.”

Andrew Case, director of research at Volexity, a cybersecurity firm specializing in threat intelligence and incident response, and industry liaison for cybersecurity at LSU since 2017

At LSU, Ghildiyal was able to finish her undergraduate degree in just three years by stacking opportunities. Earning an average of 18 course credits per semester—the equivalent of six classes—Ghildiyal put herself on the academic fast-track while also dedicating time to cyber research, service, and clubs to build her network and gain hands-on experience.

As a freshman, Ghildiyal helped LSU researchers Ibrahim “Abe” Baggili and Andrew Webb launch their project to secure virtual and augmented reality applications for U.S. military missions and training, funded by a $600K Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, grant. That research recently led to a published paper at USENIX Security ’25. Also in her freshmen year, Ghildiyal served as an ambassador for the Society of Women Engineers at LSU.

“Getting involved in clubs was really important for me because I came from Dallas, so coming to LSU, I knew nobody,” Ghildiyal said. “Getting involved in the community really helped me stay motivated and make friends, and I also learned a lot about communication and leadership.”

Networking and “talking to everyone” at LSU career fairs earned her three offers for internships her first summer. She chose International Paper in Memphis, Tennessee, because it had the strongest cyber focus.

“That summer, I got a hands-on look at different types of potential exploits and vulnerabilities,” Ghildiyal said. “I was essentially making data more accessible for International Paper’s cybersecurity teams to better respond to different findings.”

In her sophomore year, which also was her junior year, Ghildiyal joined the first cohort of students who were trained by LSU and the university’s industry partner TekStream to work in the LSU-hosted Security Operations Center, or SOC, which now protects almost all higher education in Louisiana from cyber threats. She also served as vice president of the Society of Women Engineers and as fundraising chair for Women in Computer Science.

“My most impactful class that year was Operating Systems,” Ghildiyal said. “The biggest thing I both liked and disliked was learning there’s no perfect design in operating systems. There’s no perfect solution. Everything just depends on what you want, and everything has security implications. You want peak performance? Great, but those speed gains will come with security tradeoffs. You want super secure? Sure, but stronger security checks and protections can increase overhead.”

As an incoming senior, Ghildiyal joined the LSU Cybersecurity Clinic to help secure small businesses in Louisiana, which also helped her get certified as a GIAC Certified Enterprise Defender. She also completed her pivotal internship with Chevron, where she helped increase cyberattack detection coverage and build an AI security assistant.

“I also helped set up another AI to help our teams respond faster,” Ghildiyal said. “I helped with their threat detection system—just consolidating everything and running gap analyses. We were able to identify blind spots where we were missing detections and test areas where we had detections that hadn’t been hit before.”

“In cybersecurity, it’s critical to have visibility into everything, so I was able to do some dashboarding as well,” Ghildiyal continued. “Just helping with triage to identify and respond more quickly to things.”

During her senior year, Ghildiyal served as president for Women in Computer Science, hosting the largest LSU hackathon ever in collaboration with the Security Society at LSU. She was also the LSU chapter lead for Women in Cybersecurity while hosting cyber workshops for other students (“Intro to Defensive Networking,” “Breaking into Cybersecurity: From Infosec to Ethical Hacking”) and competing in national capture-the-flag events (Penn State SillyCTF, WiCyS CTF, AWS Security Jam).

The pace of change in the U.S. power sector is speeding up.

Dramatic federal policy and funding reversals on fossil fuels and renewables are challenging the industry’s ability to adapt at a time of rising demand and rapid technological advancement. Tariffs, supply chain snarls and rising global temperatures complicate the sector’s response.

At the same time, distributed energy resources and ever-more-sophisticated software are making the grid more flexible, allowing for creative solutions to these and other system strains. Energy professionals, experts, government officials and other stakeholders will come together at conferences in 2026 to share knowledge, network and innovate.

So why are forecasters expecting Baton Rouge to see more than 2% growth?
Forecasters point to a very bullish outlook for industrial construction in the MSA.
Scott says forecasters had discussions with executives of three area firms, which alone plan to add at least 10,000 jobs over the next two years.
Forecasters’ optimism regarding the Capital Region is based on some $21.3 billion in announced industrial projects that have issued final investment decisions.","The Baton Rouge metro could gain 10,500 jobs next year and another 11,100 in 2027, making the area the fastest growing in the state in absolute growth, according to the latest version of the Louisiana Economic Forecast led by economist Loren Scott.

While Scott expects the state’s economy to operate in an environment of slow national economic growth, he predicts Louisiana will add 74,500 jobs over the two-year span, finally breaking through the 2 million mark this year and continuing into 2027.

He writes that several major uncertainties cloud forecasters’ view of the future, including the national economy, oil prices and interest rates. Generally, a 1.5% workforce growth rate is considered good. So why are forecasters expecting Baton Rouge to see more than 2% growth? Forecasters point to a very bullish outlook for industrial construction in the MSA. Baton Rouge is the headquarters for several large industrial contractors, including Turner Industries, Performance Contractors, Cajun Industries, MM&R, ISC, the Newtron Group, who are expected to rapidly build up their workforces following recent announcements of final investment decisions.

Scott says forecasters had discussions with executives of three area firms, which alone plan to add at least 10,000 jobs over the next two years. In addition, the Greater Baton Rouge Industrial Alliance also completed a survey of firms in the MSA and estimated construction worker demand will increase from 22,191 in the second quarter of 2025 to 39,921 by the third quarter of 2026—an increase of 17,730 workers.

Forecasters’ optimism regarding the Capital Region is based on some $21.3 billion in announced industrial projects that have issued final investment decisions. While a majority of those projects are planned for Ascension Parish, the parish is still poised for additional future growth. Some 17,000 acres of riverfront property are available for new projects in the parish’s new tax increment financing district, the RiverPlex MegaPark, on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

LSU leads the MSA in nonindustrial construction, with four university-related projects driving most of the $800 million nonindustrial projects slated for the region over the next two years. “The $400 million LSU Entertainment Center was about to issue an official ‘go’ to Denver-based Oak View Group,” the report reads. “Then, the top official with that company was indicted for an alleged price-fixing scheme involving a similar project in another state. We expect this will just delay, but not terminate, this project.”",https://s25562.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Baton-Rouge-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-01 15:05:34.592794

But Trump administration officials have not acknowledged whether the E.P.A.
employees said that they were working without pay, and that Trump administration officials had not told workers how long the funding would last.
He added: “This administration should stop playing games with federal workers.”","Environmental Protection Agency employees who expected to be furloughed in the government shutdown were working on Wednesday after receiving a letter late Tuesday instructing them to “work on activities which currently have funds available.”

It was unclear how many of the 15,166 employees at the E.P.A. received the exemption notice, but union officials said that they believed it to have been nearly the entire staff.

A spokeswoman for Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said that the agency was operating under its shutdown plan. That plan, however, calls for only 1,734 employees — about 11 percent of the staff — to continue working.

Federal agencies do have balances of appropriated funds that carry over from the previous funding period. Those funds could be used to stay operational for a short time — typically a week or two — after a government shutdown. But Trump administration officials have not acknowledged whether the E.P.A. is being kept open from those funds or from other unspent money from laws passed during the Biden administration.

E.P.A. employees said that they were working without pay, and that Trump administration officials had not told workers how long the funding would last.

“Continue to work on initiatives as directed by your leadership,” Aaron Szabo, who leads E.P.A.’s air office, said in a memo to his staff on Wednesday reviewed by The New York Times. He advised that employees would be “notified if there is any change in status.”

The lack of transparency, union leaders said, has fed the chaos surrounding the Trump administration’s plans for federal workers amid the impasse between Republicans and Democrats over spending.

“Workers at the E.P.A. are highly confused by the behavior of this administration, where they have published shutdown plans that call for furloughs and layoffs but then send out messaging to staff that they are exempted from the shutdown while funds are available,” said Justin Chen, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents many E.P.A. employees, in a statement.

Real World Reaction To Tariffs

'Unpredictable' Tariff Expansions Make it Harder to Justify U.S. Investments, Automakers and Suppliers Warn

Automakers and suppliers urged the Trump administration to end ""unpredictable expansions"" of tariffs, saying they're making it harder to justify investments in the U.S. That's the message of a Sept. 16 letter to the Trump administration from automotive trade groups and associations representing other industries. The business groups criticized the recent expansion of steel and aluminum tariffs to cover more than 400 new products, including auto parts and industrial robotics, saying it was ""implemented without adequate notice"" and creates more costs and uncertainty for U.S. businesses. ""At a time when many are dealing with fragile supply chains, global competition and inflationary pressures, this process creates additional uncertainty that risks slowing growth and deterring investment in the United States,"" said the letter addressed to Jeffrey Kessler, the undersecretary for industry and security at the Commerce Department.

Underwater car trade-ins climb to highest level since 2021

A growing share of American drivers are finding themselves ""underwater"" or ""upside down"" on their auto loans, reaching a four-year high, according to data from Edmunds. More than one in four (26.6%) of new vehicle trade-ins carried negative equity during the second quarter of 2025. This is up from 26.1% in Q1 2025 and marks the highest level in four years. The last time a higher percentage was recorded was Q1 2021, when nearly a third (31.9%) of new car trade-ins were underwater. Being underwater on an auto loan isn't a new phenomenon. Still, the combination of affordability pressures, negative equity and higher interest rates is creating a challenging financial environment for American car buyers. The average amount owed on upside-down loans was $6,754, slightly lower than Q1 2025's $6,880 but up from $6,255 in Q2 2024.

California Dems scramble to boost oil production

Ford courts riskier borrowers with lower rates for F-150 pickups

Ford is racing to sell more F-150 pickups this quarter by offering lower interest rates to buyers with the weakest acceptable credit histories. The deal available until the end of the month will allow consumers with shakier credit profiles to pay the lower interest rate offered to those with stellar credit records. Ford is courting these low-credit customers as it looks for a strong close to the quarter for its best-selling pickup, which starts around $39,000 and goes to almost $80,000. Like most automakers, Ford has been largely absorbing the costs of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and auto parts to keep plants humming and sales volumes high, even as it cuts into profits.

AI will impact dealers

Most U.S. car dealers expect artificial intelligence (AI) to significantly impact their operations, with half predicting AI will cut jobs by 2030. By 2035, 87% believe AI will fully replace some human roles. Only 5% think AI will never replace dealership staff entirely. The findings come from a nationwide survey of 500 U.S. car dealers commissioned by dealer tech company Phyron. The results align with a McKinsey report predicting 400 to 800 million global jobs could be displaced by new technologies, including generative AI, within five years. Yet, workers handling complex or 'messy' tasks, i.e. those managing multiple information streams and dynamic situations, face little immediate threat from AI, according to Phyron CEO Mattias

Honda ends U.S. production of Acura ZDX EV at GM's Tennessee plant

Honda is ending U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which had been scheduled to begin its 2026 model year production this month at General Motors' Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee, according to information obtained by the Detroit Free Press. The company said the decision reflects current market conditions for electric vehicles and its long-term strategic priorities. The automaker confirmed that production of the Honda Prologue, another electric model assembled by GM in Mexico, will continue. Honda said the ZDX provided a foundation for its electrification strategy and will be followed by the all-electric Acura RSX, set to launch in Ohio in the second half of 2026, along with hybrid-electric Acura models now in development.

Aggressive driving changes

Some aggressive driving behaviors have increased over the past decade while others have actually fallen, but nearly all drivers say they've engaged in them. AAA discovered the trends in a recent update of a study its Foundation for Traffic Safety first conducted in 2016. Comparing today's results with the original, it found aggressive driving feeds on itself. Since 2016, cutting off fellow motorists has jumped 67% and honking in anger 47%, according to this year's study. That's particularly concerning because AAA said it found that the more drivers experience others' aggression on the road, the more likely they are to drive aggressively themselves.

In two landmark cases, the court will soon have the opportunity to reassert the federal government’s authority over questions of national energy and environmental policy.

Environmental groups believe that energy use increases global temperatures, causes sea levels to rise and creates more destructive weather. Their campaign to curtail energy has taken many forms — including asking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to block pipelines and the Interior Department to deny oil and gas leases — but it met a roadblock with the 2024 election and the Trump administration’s subsequent blizzard of executive orders lifting overregulation.

Rather than pursue their interests in Congress or before the electorate, environmental extremists have now allied with bankrupt cities and trial lawyers to use the courts to shake down the energy industry. Blue cities and states have filed tort suits in state courts to extract money for allegedly causing weather-related costs in their jurisdictions.

The Supreme Court will soon decide whether to take up one of those cases, Boulder County v. Suncor Energy, following a ruling this year from the Colorado Supreme Court that allowed the county’s case to move forward in state court. Borrowing theories of liability from tobacco and opioid litigation, Boulder alleges that energy companies sold their products without disclosing climate risks. Such claims plainly intrude on federal authority over interstate pollution.

Other climate cases are still progressing in lower state courts. In Hawaii, summary judgment motions are pending in a case seeking damages for rising sea levels. Hawaii’s highest court allowed this litigation to move forward in 2023 with Justice Todd Eddins issuing a remarkable concurrence, declaring that litigation would proceed under the “Aloha Spirit,” regardless of federal precedent.

In Rhode Island, the state judge presiding over a similar lawsuit against the energy industry compared it to developing nations devastated by natural disasters, citing Kenya, Tanzania and the Seychelles. The suggestion that Rhode Island has suffered comparable “severe destruction” is telling: judges are inflating rhetoric to justify climate claims, not grounding them in law.

Meanwhile, other states are effectively trying to replace federal authority over environmental policy. In Louisiana, plaintiffs obtained a $750 million judgment (potentially over $1 billion with interest) against Chevron for coastal erosion that they claimed was caused by oil extraction during World War II. Those companies had been under federal contracts to supply aviation fuel for the war effort. Yet eight decades later, Louisiana claims it can punish those practices retroactively.

The energy firms sought to move the case to federal court because of its genesis in work for the federal government. But a divided 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel refused to allow it. As Judge Andrew Oldham rightly noted in dissent, crude oil extraction plainly “relates to” war production. If states can sue private businesses for their wartime work generations later, future cooperation with the federal government will be chilled, raising the costs of national defense. This coming term, the Supreme Court will review the Fifth Circuit’s decision.

Despite some disappointing rulings from activist judges, a growing number of state courts are beginning to resist such frivolous claims. A Maryland judge rejected Baltimore’s lawsuit that alleged fossil fuels caused sea rises that have harmed the city; the Maryland Supreme Court will hear the appeal later in October. A South Carolina court dismissed Charleston’s similar claims, which blue city officials will almost certainly appeal as well. Likewise, nearly identical state and municipal lawsuits have been similarly dismissed in Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and New Jersey.

Notwithstanding some recent wins, climate lawfare is like Hydra — new cases are constantly being brought. Even if higher courts ultimately overturn them, simply forcing the industry to defend against these suits imposes enormous litigation costs. That alone is a victory for environmental radicals. At this stage, the Supreme Court must act to reaffirm federal authority over national energy and environmental policy.

If climate change is producing harmful effects nationwide, then the nation should decide how to address it. As the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in a 2021 case rejecting New York City’s lawsuit against Chevron, “the question before us is whether a nuisance suit seeking to recover damages for the harms caused by global greenhouse gas emissions may proceed under New York law. Our answer is simple: no.” However, they frame their aims, blue cities and states are trying to set nationwide climate policy through litigation — violating federal law and tort principles.

As the country decides how to respond to climate change, those choices — including the possibility of not acting — must have nationwide legitimacy. Courts cannot allow a handful of blue jurisdictions, aided by trial lawyers and environmental activists, to dictate those decisions for the rest of America.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scalia.AEIdeas.031224.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 15:04:08.693629

Sustainea Bioglycols, an innovative company focused on manufacturing sustainable plant-based chemicals with a low-carbon footprint, has announced plans to invest $400 million in Lafayette, Ind. The company will work closely with Primient, a local producer of food and industrial ingredients made from plant-based, renewable sources.

Sustainea will ultimately convert corn-based dextrose precursors provided by Primient into Bio-MEG (monoethlene glycol), a chemical intermediate used in everyday products from bottles and food containers to footwear and more. The renewable feedstock will reduce the need for traditional fossil-based plastics. It integrates seamlessly into existing manufacturing and recycling processes without compromising performance or functionality.

“Investing in Lafayette allows us to do more than build this innovative technology, it means strengthening Indiana’s agricultural markets, creating new opportunities for local corn growers, and contributing to the state’s thriving agbioscience economy,” said Gustavo Sergi, CEO at Sustainea.

“Together with our partners, we are proud to position Indiana at the forefront of innovation in chemistry and also excited to see Indiana and United States of America becoming the cradle of the global transition toward sustainable and competitive packaging, textiles and apparel.”

Primient added that the area’s strong agricultural base will help production.

“Partnering with Sustainea allows us to leverage locally grown corn to reduce reliance on fossil-based plastics, delivering real value to farmers, businesses and consumers alike,” said Travis Montoya, Lafayette Plant Manager for Primient. “Our team in Lafayette is uniquely positioned to support this investment with high-quality, low-carbon dextrose and a strong agricultural base — helping increase demand for Indiana corn and support growth in the regional economy.”

Sustainea said it plans to create up to 190 new, high-wage jobs in the coming years to support its growth. Production is slated to begin in 2028.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in U.S. electric-vehicle sales following the disappearance of a critical $7,500 tax break for buyers.

“It’s a game-changer,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said during a Detroit event on Tuesday, just hours before the federal subsidy expired.

Farley said he would not be surprised if electric-car sales drop to 5% of total U.S. vehicle sales next month. That would be about half the level from August – a monthly record as consumers hurried to take advantage of the credit – and among the lowest levels in several years.

“The EV market is going to collapse in October,” said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. Japan’s Nissan is still rolling out a redesigned version of its Nissan Leaf small EV in the U.S., but Meunier expects tough competition as rival automakers strain to find buyers for their electric cars.

“That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” Meunier told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.

Congress approved a $7,500 tax credit in 2008 for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the U.S. that use certain levels of domestically sourced batteries and materials.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration. His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations. Trump campaigned last year on ending former President Joe Biden’s “EV mandate.”

Electric-vehicle registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit, according to a joint study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University.

A SURPLUS OF UNSOLD EVs

The U.S. already lags other major car markets in EV adoption. In China, the global leader in EVs and production of batteries and their raw materials, sales of electrics and plug-in hybrids have surpassed 40% in recent months. Europe’s penetration rate has hovered close to 20%.

Even with the U.S. tax credit in place, sales growth in electric cars had decelerated in the past two years, before the deadline rush this past summer. That slowdown occurred in spite of automakers launching a slew of new EV models. Electric-vehicle sales rose just 1.5% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.

Some dealers worry that the removal of the $7,500 tax credit will saddle them with unsold EVs.

Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a U.S. Midwest dealer group, said his group would take fewer EVs from manufacturers in the near term as his team waits to see how consumer demand shakes out.

Brad Sowers, who owns dealerships in the St. Louis, Missouri, area that sell Chevrolet, Jeep and other brands, said he thinks more-affordable EVs will continue to sell. But he worries that pricier models such as General Motors’ Chevy Silverado electric pickup truck – which can top $90,000 – will struggle.

GM and Ford are seeking to ease the blow of losing the tax incentive through programs that would allow dealers to roll the tax break into lease terms for several more months, Reuters reported this week.

Hyundai is offering $7,500 off its 2025 model-year Ioniq 5 EVs, and up to $9,800 in price reductions on 2026 model years of the vehicle, said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America.

“There was an EV market before IRA, and there’s going to be an EV market after IRA,” Parker said.

Automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in U.S. electric-vehicle sales following the disappearance of a critical $7,500 tax break for buyers.

""It's a game-changer,"" Ford F CEO Jim Farley said during a Detroit event on Tuesday, just hours before the federal subsidy expired.

Farley said he would not be surprised if electric-car sales drop to 5% of total U.S. vehicle sales next month. That would be about half the level from August – a monthly record as consumers hurried to take advantage of the credit – and among the lowest levels in several years.

“The EV market is going to collapse in October,” said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. Japan's Nissan 7201 is still rolling out a redesigned version of its Nissan Leaf small EV in the U.S., but Meunier expects tough competition as rival automakers strain to find buyers for their electric cars.

“That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” Meunier told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.

Congress approved a $7,500 tax credit in 2008 for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the U.S. that use certain levels of domestically sourced batteries and materials.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration. His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations. Trump campaigned last year on ending former President Joe Biden's ""EV mandate.""

Electric-vehicle registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit, according to a joint study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University.

A SURPLUS OF UNSOLD EVs

The U.S. already lags other major car markets in EV adoption. In China, the global leader in EVs and production of batteries and their raw materials, sales of electrics and plug-in hybrids have surpassed 40% in recent months. Europe’s penetration rate has hovered close to 20%.

Even with the U.S. tax credit in place, sales growth in electric cars had decelerated in the past two years, before the deadline rush this past summer. That slowdown occurred in spite of automakers launching a slew of new EV models. Electric-vehicle sales rose just 1.5% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.

Some dealers worry that the removal of the $7,500 tax credit will saddle them with unsold EVs.

Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a U.S. Midwest dealer group, said his group would take fewer EVs from manufacturers in the near term as his team waits to see how consumer demand shakes out.

Brad Sowers, who owns dealerships in the St. Louis, Missouri, area that sell Chevrolet, Jeep and other brands, said he thinks more-affordable EVs will continue to sell. But he worries that pricier models such as General Motors’ GM Chevy Silverado electric pickup truck – which can top $90,000 – will struggle.

GM and Ford are seeking to ease the blow of losing the tax incentive through programs that would allow dealers to roll the tax break into lease terms for several more months, Reuters reported this week.

Hyundai 005380 is offering $7,500 off its 2025 model-year Ioniq 5 EVs, and up to $9,800 in price reductions on 2026 model years of the vehicle, said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America.

Brimstone (headquartered in Oakland) and Gallo Glass (in Modesto) are two other California companies with projects on the DOE’s cancellation list from May.

If these projects are fully cut, California will lose a crucial opportunity to modernize its manufacturing base, create high-quality jobs, and to be among the first states to produce net-zero emission cement. This comes at a time when investment in decarbonization is more important than ever to ensure that California can deliver on its emission reduction requirements while ensuring energy affordability.

These projects, to which funding had been obligated earlier this year, are already delivering benefits to their local communities. In Southern California, where National Cement had planned to use its $500 million grant to retrofit its cement plant to produce net-zero emission cement, the company has already successfully demonstrated the viability of a cleaner cement blend, LC3 (limestone-calcined clay). In June, National Ready Mixed Concrete Company completed test pours of walls and slab and found strong performance and strength while reducing emissions up to 34 percent. By replacing some conventional cement—which is very emissions-intensive to produce—with calcined clay, LC3 reduces emissions while increasing the volume of cement that a plant can produce. California imports 20 percent of its cement, some of which could be offset by in-state production of LC3.

Brimstone (headquartered in Oakland) and Gallo Glass (in Modesto) are two other California companies with projects on the DOE’s cancellation list from May. Brimstone secured a $189 million grant to build a facility to manufacture cement without process emissions at commercial scale. Gallo Glass was awarded $75 million to install a demonstration hybrid electric furnace to reduce its use of natural gas and increase recycled content in its glass bottles.

The effect of these supply-side cuts is compounded by the Republican reconciliation package clawback of nearly $32 million that had been awarded to California to help the state build highway infrastructure with clean, innovative, resilient American-made cement.

The analysis was presented by the “New Energy Alliance,” a group of 20 companies including Enpal, 1Komma5° and Octopus Energy as well as engineering company Bosch, real estate company Vonovia, metering company Techem, automotive industry company Volkswagen Group Charging (Elli) and others. Decentralised solutions describe an energy ecosystem that generates and stores energy close to the point of consumption, including PV systems, battery storage solutions, heat pumps and e-mobility based on smart and bidirectional charging. The analysis found that fast and target-oriented measures to better integrate these solutions are necessary to tap into a possible added value of 255 billion euros by 2045.

By contrast, the major focus on new gas-fired power plants as backup for renewables chosen by economy minister Katherina Reiche would not be justified. Even if gas plants have a purpose in a cost-efficient system, putting too much weight on the fossil fuel plants that run on imported natural gas comes with geopolitical risks by keeping Germany dependent on importers, the analysis concluded. Digitally connected systems based on solar and wind power, on the other hand, can stabilise the power system and strengthen the German economy as a high-tech location in markets of the future. An “interplay” between centralised and decentralised would offer the most efficient approach.

Energy company 1Komma5° commented that, besides renewable power and “needs-based” backup capacity, decentralised options should be “consistently developed as a third main pillar of Germany’s energy mix.” Individual households and small companies had the biggest potential for becoming more cost-efficient in their energy use, the company said, arguing that a more flexible demand and supply pattern could save the average household up to 1,200 euros per year.

A recent monitoring report of the German energy transition commissioned by economy minister Katherina Reiche found that the transformation generally is advancing on the right course. The monitoring labelled as a “reality check” by the minister underlined that the expansion of renewable energy sources and flexibility solutions such as storage are needed both to reach the country’s climate targets and keep the economy competitive.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-10-01 17:04:56.655717

This would be a significant change from the country’s energy mix, which has been reliant on fossil fuel production in general, and gas in particular, for many years.

Ember recommends dramatically increasing the solar and storage targets, in particular, set out in the RPDP, calling for 89% more new solar capacity and 60% more new battery capacity.

This would be a significant change from the country’s energy mix, which has been reliant on fossil fuel production in general, and gas in particular, for many years. The graph below shows that the contributions of gas to the country’s energy mix have increased in recent years, accounting for over two-thirds of domestic electricity generation in 2024.

The report notes, however, that the current RPDP would require significant investment in new electricity generation, and leave Thailand vulnerable to foreign gas imports. It notes that US$153 billion in new investments will be needed to meet the RPDP targets, and in 2024 imported gas accounted for 40% of gas used in Thailand, up from just over 20% in 2015, and this trend is expected to continue in the years to come.

Ember recommends dramatically increasing the solar and storage targets, in particular, set out in the RPDP, calling for 89% more new solar capacity and 60% more new battery capacity. The report calls this the “cost-optimal pathway” as, while investment in new energy projects will be US$15 billion higher than under the RPDP plan, the replacement of gas generation capacity with new solar and storage projects will cut power generation costs by US$1.8 billion.

The report also calls for a lowering of gas consumption by 11%, compared to RPDP figures. This would reduce fuel costs by US$16 billion compared to the RPDP scenario, meaning that the combination of greater solar and storage investments, and a lower reliance on gas imports, would generate a net saving in new energy investments, while improving the resilience of the country’s grid.

“Emerging countries are at a crossroads of meeting a rising electricity demand at affordable costs to drive the economy while cutting emissions for sustainability goals,” explained Ember energy analyst and lead author of the report, Lam Pham.

“Solar, coupled with battery storage, represents the optimal pathway to address this trilemma. The energy transition of Thailand towards home-grown renewables could lower energy costs, cut emissions and strengthen energy security by mitigating dependence on fossil fuel imports.”

The report also notes that there is likely to be considerable demand for new electricity generation from electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and data centre deployments. Ember expects data centres alone to increase electricity demand by 10TWh by 2037, with the market to grow by a combined annual growth rate of as much as 8.5% between 2025 and 2027, while EVs are expected to account for one-fifth of the country’s electricity demand by 2037.

Ember said that solar and storage ought to be the “foundation” of the country’s changing energy mix, which could be prone to “demand spikes or renewable shortfalls” in the coming years.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sungrow-Thailand.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 16:02:44.650431

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published proposed revisions to the procedural framework rule for conducting risk evaluations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) on September 23, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 45690. The proposed rule seeks to overhaul significant portions of the 2024 Biden-era rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 37028 (May 3, 2024), 40 C.F.R. Part 702, Subpart B, citing the need for a more efficient evaluation process that can be completed within the statutory timeframes. That 2024 rule had revised the first Trump EPA’s version of the Risk Evaluation Framework Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 33726 (July 20, 2017). The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) website indicates that EPA expects to issue a final rule in April 2026.

The preamble to the proposed rule states that the proposed revisions specifically target changes made in the 2024 final rule that may not be consistent with the best reading of TSCA and that may impede the timely completion of risk evaluations, unnecessarily impairing the effective and efficient protection of health and the environment. The preamble also frequently references issues raised during the public comment period for the Biden-era rule as support for seeking to ease the regulatory burden associated with risk evaluations.

The proposed rule includes the following proposed revisions:

A requirement for EPA to make a determination of unreasonable risk for each of the conditions of use within the scope of the chemical’s risk evaluation, instead of a single risk determination on the chemical substance as a whole.

Changes as to how EPA will consider occupational exposure controls such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial controls when conducting risk evaluations and making risk determinations.

Changes regarding EPA’s discretionary authority to determine which conditions of use, exposure routes, and exposure pathways it will consider in a risk evaluation.

Revisions to certain regulatory definitions.

Revisions to the procedures and requirements EPA would follow when revising or supplementing risk evaluation documents.

Amendments to the process and requirements that manufacturers (including importers) are required to follow when they request an Agency-conducted TSCA risk evaluation.

Comments on the proposed changes are due by November 7, 2025.

Proposed Revisions

Risk Determinations by Condition of Use

Chief among the proposed changes is the elimination of the “whole chemical” approach to risk evaluations. The Risk Evaluation Framework Rule adopted by the first Trump administration in 2017 provided that EPA “will determine whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under each condition of use.” In practice, this amounted to individual risk determinations for each condition of use. In 2021, the Biden EPA announced a different approach, stating, “The agency plans to make the determination of unreasonable risk just once for the whole chemical when it is clear the majority of the conditions of use warrant one determination.” The 2024 revision of the Risk Evaluation Framework Rule provided that “EPA will make a single determination as to whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk … under the conditions of use.” The 2025 proposed rule would reverse course again, saying, “EPA will determine whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk … by making separate risk determinations for each condition of use.”

Both approaches rely on interpretations of TSCA section 6(b)(4)(A). It provides that EPA is to conduct risk evaluations “to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk … under the conditions of use.” Multiple courts of appeals are considering this very issue in judicial review of the risk management rules issued by the Biden EPA and their respective risk evaluations. Under Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), a court is to determine the “best” interpretation of a statute, not an agency, meaning that the courts will not defer to either of EPA’s conflicting interpretations of this TSCA provision.

Occupational Exposure Controls

Another proposed change relates to the consideration of whether exposure controls, including PPE, are used to protect employees from exposure to a chemical substance. The proposed rule would add:

In determining whether unreasonable risk is presented, EPA’s consideration of occupational exposure scenarios will take into account reasonably available information on the implementation and use of occupational exposure control measures such as engineering and administrative controls and personal protective equipment.

This language would replace the 2024 rule’s provision, taking the opposite approach, under which a risk evaluation would consider:

known and reasonably foreseen circumstances where subpopulations of workers are exposed due to the absence or ineffective use of personal protective equipment. EPA will not consider exposure reduction based on assumed use of personal protective equipment as part of the risk determination.

This issue also involves statutory interpretation, specifically the meaning of the definition of “conditions of use” in TSCA section 3(4), which includes both “reasonably foreseen” conditions and those that are intended or known. Non-use of exposure controls may be reasonably foreseen, but use of exposure controls may be generally known to prevail. This is another issue ongoing in the judicial challenges to risk management rules and their risk evaluations.

In the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA requests comment on whether a definition of “reasonably foreseen” would be helpful. If so, the preamble indicated that EPA would likely rely on language used in determinations under TSCA section 5 that a chemical substance is not likely to present an unreasonable risk:

Reasonably foreseen conditions of use are future circumstances, distinct from known or intended conditions of use, under which the chemical substance may be manufactured, processed, distributed, used, or disposed of. EPA expects that the identification of “reasonably foreseen” conditions of use will be made on a fact-specific, case-by-case basis.

EPA’s Discretionary Authority Over Scope of Risk Evaluations

TSCA section 6(b)(4)(D) directs EPA to identify in the scope for the risk evaluation the conditions of use that “the Administrator expects to consider.” The 2017 Risk Evaluation Framework Rule’s preamble found that the quoted language:

suggest[s] that EPA is not required to consider all conditions of use. Consequently, EPA may, on a case-by-case basis, exclude certain activities that EPA has determined to be conditions of use in order to focus its analytical efforts on those exposures that are likely to present the greatest concern, and consequently merit an unreasonable risk determination.

The 2024 revision disagreed with that approach and instead declared that “EPA will not exclude conditions of use from the scope of the risk evaluation.” It added that “a fit-for-purpose approach may result in varying types and levels of analysis and supporting information for certain conditions of use.”

Now, the 2025 proposal would restore the 2017 position by deleting the 2024 statement because “EPA believes that TSCA is best read as permitting the Agency to exercise discretion … under TSCA section 6(b)(4)(D) in determining what conditions of use EPA expects to consider in a risk evaluation, recognizing that the statute clearly envisions comprehensive risk evaluations.” The preamble identified uses of a chemical substance as an impurity or byproduct as conditions of use that might be excluded from the scope of a risk evaluation for that substance, although “generally the better approach for most chemical substances” is to consider those uses together with other uses of that substance, citing the example of 1,4-dioxane. Another example mentioned as an excludable condition of use is use in a product at de minimis levels.

This issue has not arisen in cases contesting risk management rules and their conditions of use.

Regulatory Definitions

EPA proposes removing the phrase “overburdened communities” from the definition of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.” The statutory definition in section 3(12) does not mention that phrase. The Biden EPA added the phrase to the definition’s list of examples of groups of individuals that may be at greater risk. The proposed definition would become essentially identical to the statutory definition:

“Potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation” means “a group of individuals within the general population identified by EPA who, due to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or mixture, such as infants, children, pregnant women, workers, or the elderly.”

EPA proposes to take this action in response to concerns from commenters that the phrase and its explanations in the 2024 rule preamble were overly broad and vague. EPA requests comments on whether its regulatory definitions should depart from the statutory definitions.

EPA proposes to add a definition for “weight of scientific evidence.” The 2017 final rule added a definition, but the 2024 rule deleted it, on the basis that it was “both unnecessary and could inhibit the Agency’s flexibility to quickly adapt to and implement advancing scientific practices and approaches.” The proposed 2025 definition would differ from the one in the 2017 rule. It would state:

“Weight of scientific evidence” means “an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation. Quality and relevance determinations, at a minimum, should include consideration of study design, fitness for purpose, replicability, peer review, and transparency and reliability of data.”

The 2024 rule also deleted the 2017 definition of “best available science,” but the current proposal does not include a definition for that term. Both terms are used in section 26, but TSCA does not define either term. Whether EPA relied on the best available science is an issue in the pending litigation on the asbestos risk management rule.

Revisions to Existing Risk Evaluations

The 2024 version of the rule added a provision on revising final risk evaluations, whereby EPA generally must undergo the prioritization process again before making revisions. The 2025 proposal would eliminate that restriction, asserting that EPA must be able to efficiently fix risk evaluations that do not meet the statutory science standards under TSCA sections 26(h) and (i). This regulatory change would allow EPA to revise a risk evaluation without re-prioritization in other circumstances as well. For example, EPA would be able to revise a risk evaluation when a scientific error results in a determination that a condition of use presents an unreasonable risk, when, in fact, it does not. Under the proposed change, EPA would have to publish a new draft and final risk evaluation and solicit public comments and peer review, as appropriate.

Simplifying Requirements for Manufacturer-Requested Risk Evaluations

EPA is proposing to scale back information collection obligations that the 2024 rule imposed on manufacturers requesting risk evaluations. Specifically, EPA proposes to delete language requiring manufacturers to provide EPA with the information necessary to carry out the risk evaluation, shorten the meaning of “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” in this context, and only require manufacturers to submit information on the conditions of use that are identified in the risk evaluation request.

Commentary

This ping-pong approach to the Risk Evaluation Framework Rule reflects the conflicting statutory interpretations and policy views of the different Administrations. Another example of multiple revisions of regulatory requirements is EPA’s Risk Management Program, 40 C.F.R. Part 68. See our alert here.

At some point, the courts may resolve certain of these statutory interpretation disputes by providing what they consider to be the “best” reading of TSCA. A judicial challenge to the 2024 rule was argued before the D.C. Circuit on March 21, 2025; however, that case is currently held in abeyance pending further court order. While publication of the 2025 proposed rule might result in resolution of that case, it is likely that the first case to go to decision is the one involving the methylene chloride rule and its risk evaluation, as the case was argued before a panel of the Fifth Circuit on June 3, 2025, four months ago.

The Risk Evaluation Framework Rule is the basis for all chemical substance evaluations conducted according to its procedures. The proposed rule is deregulatory in nature, with significant scale-backs from the 2024 final rule and the proposed reimplementation of some 2017 provisions. It raises important issues for many stakeholders. Beveridge & Diamond encourages affected companies and their trade associations to submit comments by November 7, 2025.

According to Experian, the relatively new company claims 46.89% of the U.S. EV market in the second quarter of 2025. The Detroit Three are all fighting for the rest of the pie, and Chevrolet’s been gaining ground in an interesting reversal.

Ford came out of the gate strong with its 2022 EV sales

Ford went after Tesla hard with its F-150 Lightning, attempting to undercut the Cybertruck prices. Its big play was the Mustang Mach-E, a uniquely American twist on the formula that makes the Tesla Model Y the planet’s best-selling vehicle.

The Blue Oval’s buzzy new EV lineup landed it 28.42% of the U.S. EV market by quarter two of 2022. But instead of major redesigns for these winners, CEO Jim Farley is pivoting to focus on an all-new factory type (also based on Tesla innovations) and an upcoming electric compact pickup truck. As a result, newer and shinier EVs from Detroit are chipping away at Ford’s market share.

By Q2 2023, Ford’s EV market share had dropped to 20.61%, then by Q2 2024, it had dipped to 19.72%. Now, it’s at a shocking 13.48%.

In the same time, Hyundai’s market share rose as high as 22.18% before falling to 17.01% after a major recall led to Hyundai EV durability concerns.

The latest winner in domestic EV sales

The consistent winner has been Ford’s cross-town rival: Chevrolet. In Q2 2022, Chevy could only claim 12.97% of the market. But in the past four years, Chevrolet and Ford have nearly swapped places, with 25.9% of non-luxury EVs sold in the U.S. in Q2 2025 wearing bowties.

It’s interesting to note that instead of going toe-to-toe with Tesla’s offerings, Chevy has offered some unique models. The Volt was one of the only range-extended EVs ever available, and a fresh take on the formula. But it was discontinued. Now the Bolt is a true compact car, smaller than anything Tesla makes. Its latest designs include huge EV trucks and SUVs, including the new Hummer and the Silverado/Sierra. While they aren’t included in this “non-luxury” category, Cadillac’s EV lineup—including the Rolls-Royce-priced Celestiq—is large and uniquely Cadillac.

Of course, the most popular Chevy EV is still its direct Model Y competitor, the Equinox crossover.

The Tax Incidence Of EV Tax Credits Within economic theory lies the concept of “tax incidence”.
This same tax incidence example applies to the now disappearing EV tax credit.
Effective October 1, the $7,500 EV tax credit will no longer be offered for EV purchases.","The $7,500 EV tax credit was one of many casualties resulting from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While this bill was signed into law on July 4, the credit did not expire for several months, according to Forbes. However, as of October 1, these credits are no longer available, leading to questions about the future of this segment of the automotive industry. Most notably, the tax incidence for purchasing these vehicles shifts from the Federal government to the purchasers or the car manufacturers. This article discusses how tax incidence shapes retail consumer decisions and whether the disappearance of this credit will affect the automotive industry, most notably, those companies that have invested heavily in the manufacturing and production of EVs.

EV Tax Credits

The EV tax credit was first introduced in 2005 and greatly expanded in 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The amount that has been given for these vehicles is up to $7,500, which the dealer removed from the price of the car. In turn, the dealer applied for a rebate from the federal government for the amount of the tax credit.

This tax credit has led to a massive increase in the number of EVS purchased over the past two decades. As discussed by Forbes, EVs were once extraordinarily expensive, and purchasing one meant an undue financial burden on the consumer. Put differently, most purchasers early on acquired these vehicles less because it was a wise financial decision and more because of the non-financial benefits, such as making a positive impact on the environment and fighting global warming.

The EV tax credits changed the calculus for purchasing these vehicles. Many consumers saw the tax incentives as a mechanism to acquire an EV since it substantially lowered the after-tax costs relative to other vehicles. As demand rose due to the lower cost, producers of the EVs ramped up production and enhanced their products. The entire car industry has been upended by newcomers, such as Tesla and Rivian, which offer fully electric vehicle options at prices not much different than their counterparts in gas-powered vehicles. Other manufacturers, like Ford and General Motors, and luxury brand vehicles like Audi and BMW, have increased manufacturing and sales of EVs.

The Tax Incidence Of EV Tax Credits

Within economic theory lies the concept of “tax incidence”. This idea was coined early on by research published in the Journal of Political Economy, stating that the person or entity paying the tax may not necessarily be the person physically paying the tax bill to the government. Other academic research has expanded on this concept, demonstrating that tax incidence can vary substantially across taxpayers, business entities, and governmental regimes.

As an example, according to CBS News, the state of Illinois will now apply a $0.50 tax on every sports gambling bet made via sports betting apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and Underdog. These gambling companies must decide who will ultimately bear the burden of taxation imposed by the State of Illinois. If the companies bear the tax incidence, then they can determine the tax bill based on the number of wagers and pay it, thereby lowering the company’s earnings. However, if the companies want to shift the tax incidence to their customers, then they can add on a $0.50 surcharge to every bet made in the state of Illinois. This addition would make each bet more costly. However, it will be their customer who ultimately bears the burden of taxation. While it may come as little surprise that the gambling companies chose the latter, this example helps illustrate that the tax incidence for new layer of tax fell on the consumers rather than the company.

This same tax incidence example applies to the now disappearing EV tax credit. Effective October 1, the $7,500 EV tax credit will no longer be offered for EV purchases. Consider a Tesla Model Y, which has a standard all-in purchase price of around $47,500. On September 30, the price of this vehicle is $40,000, but that price reverts back to its standard purchase price the very next day. Thus, moving forward, the price of the EV will be $7,500 more expensive that it was before the tax credit’s expiration.

The question now arises whether the company or the taxpayer will bear the incidence of this tax. For instance, Tesla can maintain their price on their vehicles even after the tax credit is no longer offered. However, this decision would come at a risk that consumers may now be less incentivized to purchase the electric vehicles, resulting in a decline in demand at the standard price. On the contrary, Tesla can absorb the costs of the tax credit and continue providing consumers with the same price, even though Tesla will not receive the tax rebates from the government. While the decision by the automobile manufacturers has not yet been made, they will soon need to decide on their pricing strategies now that the EV tax credit is no longer available.

The notion that EV manufacturers will need to decide between decreased demand and decreased profit margin suggests that the automobile manufacturers will take a hit to their earnings one way or another due to the disappearing EV tax credit. Put differently, if demand declines because the price is now higher (without a corresponding increase in after-tax earnings) then earnings will fall. Conversely, if the automobile manufacturers absorb the costs, then their profit margins will also decline. What is key for these companies is that they balance out the tax incidence of the reduced tax incentives.

As discussed by CNBC, the automobile industry is about to establish a new baseline demand for EVs. With the EV tax credit going away starting October 1, this article demonstrates that the auto manufacturers will need to assess their sensitivity for absorbing these diminished tax incentives by lowering their retail prices or passing these diminished tax incentives onto the consumer by maintaining their prices (albeit with a higher after-tax price). Regardless of their decision, the EV auto industry is now facing its toughest battle as it seeks to continue its rise in popularity without federal EV tax credits.",https://static.mocortech.com/www/static/images/news/og_img.png,N,,2025-10-01 15:03:16.146810

My childhood was spent in Houston and filled with daily summer showers and fall hurricanes. Family vacations were spent at Hill Country lakes and Gulf Coast beaches. And the entirety of my career has been in the water industry in San Antonio. My children are growing up spending weekends at our favorite spot on the Frio River. This summer, my four-year-old witnessed the Frio River flood and has already developed a respect for the power of water.

My father instilled the desire to pursue an engineering career, but I found myself in the water industry by chance. An internship in college opened my eyes to the critical role played by public utilities. That internship led me to begin my engineering career working for public municipalities as a consultant. I worked on many water and wastewater projects in the San Antonio and Texas regions but found myself supporting the River Authority Utilities Department. As I got to know the team and their passion for the critical services they provide – I jumped at the opportunity to work with them.

I’ve had the privilege of serving as Manager of the Utilities Department since December of 2024. In this role, I oversee the operation of our wastewater treatment plants, guide infrastructure improvements to our collection systems, and ensure that our utilities operate efficiently and responsibly. Every project we undertake is rooted in the River Authority’s mission: to protect and enhance the San Antonio River Basin. For me, that means turning technical expertise into real, measurable benefits for the communities we serve. Wastewater isn’t something most people think about day to day—but the way we manage it has a direct impact on the health of our rivers, the quality of our environment, and the resilience of our communities. Our team’s work behind the scenes makes sure that the water leaving our treatment plants is safe, that our infrastructure can withstand growth and change, and that our operations continue to set the standard for excellence.

When I look ahead, I’m especially excited about strengthening workforce development for our wastewater field staff. The men and women who are passionate about this critical service are truly the heart of our department. Their work is often behind the scenes, yet it is essential—from the crews who maintain the collection systems, to the operators who ensure proper treatment, to the technicians who keep equipment running, and the compliance staff who safeguard both our community and the environment. These careers are not always recognized alongside other valued trades, yet they are vital to public health and the future of our waterways.

Amado Zambrano, Chief Operator of the River Authority’s Utilities, gives a tour of the Martinez II WWTP to incoming staff.

With many seasoned operators approaching retirement, we face a significant employment gap. It is our responsibility to invest in training, mentorship, and recognition to inspire the next generation of water professionals and instill in them the same passion for service. At the same time, I see tremendous potential to pair this workforce development with innovation – from smart technologies that allow us to detect and resolve issues faster, to sustainable infrastructure practices that minimize environmental impact. Together, people and technology will drive our ability to continue improving how we serve the community and protect the river.

For me, water is more than a resource—it’s a responsibility. Working at the River Authority allows me to carry that responsibility with pride, knowing that each improvement we make today will ripple forward for years to come.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in U.S. electric-vehicle sales following the disappearance of a critical $7,500 tax break for buyers.

""It's a game-changer,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during a Detroit event on Tuesday, just hours before the federal subsidy expired.

Farley said he would not be surprised if electric-car sales drop to 5% of total U.S. vehicle sales next month. That would be about half the level from August – a monthly record as consumers hurried to take advantage of the credit – and among the lowest levels in several years.

“The EV market is going to collapse in October,” said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. Japan's Nissan is still rolling out a redesigned version of its Nissan Leaf small EV in the U.S., but Meunier expects tough competition as rival automakers strain to find buyers for their electric cars.

“That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” Meunier told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.

Congress approved a $7,500 tax credit in 2008 for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the U.S. that use certain levels of domestically sourced batteries and materials.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration. His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations. Trump campaigned last year on ending former President Joe Biden's ""EV mandate.""

Electric-vehicle registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit, according to a joint study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University.

A SURPLUS OF UNSOLD EVs

The U.S. already lags other major car markets in EV adoption. In China, the global leader in EVs and production of batteries and their raw materials, sales of electrics and plug-in hybrids have surpassed 40% in recent months. Europe’s penetration rate has hovered close to 20%.

Even with the U.S. tax credit in place, sales growth in electric cars had decelerated in the past two years, before the deadline rush this past summer. That slowdown occurred in spite of automakers launching a slew of new EV models. Electric-vehicle sales rose just 1.5% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.

Some dealers worry that the removal of the $7,500 tax credit will saddle them with unsold EVs.

Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a U.S. Midwest dealer group, said his group would take fewer EVs from manufacturers in the near term as his team waits to see how consumer demand shakes out.

Brad Sowers, who owns dealerships in the St. Louis, Missouri, area that sell Chevrolet, Jeep and other brands, said he thinks more-affordable EVs will continue to sell. But he worries that pricier models such as General Motors’ Chevy Silverado electric pickup truck – which can top $90,000 – will struggle.

GM and Ford are seeking to ease the blow of losing the tax incentive through programs that would allow dealers to roll the tax break into lease terms for several more months, Reuters reported this week.

Hyundai is offering $7,500 off its 2025 model-year Ioniq 5 EVs, and up to $9,800 in price reductions on 2026 model years of the vehicle, said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America.

“There was an EV market before IRA, and there’s going to be an EV market after IRA,” Parker said.

Volvo Car CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters in a recent interview that the Swedish automaker will not shift its strategy based on government policies.

“Our ambition is to be an electric company. That is not based on any tax credits or incentives. It's based on an electric car is better for U.S. consumers.”

Next week, the Supreme Court will be back in session and ready to deal new blows to our basic institutions of governance while stripping away longstanding rights and protections for marginalized communities. The Court’s docket includes cases on the constitutionality of racial gerrymandering, bans on gay “conversion therapy,” campaign finance restrictions, and more.

The Court has also picked up several environmental cases to round out its 2025-2026 docket, including a notable case out of Louisiana: Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish. The suit involves coastal parishes in Louisiana who filed lawsuits against several oil and gas conglomerates, including Texaco (now owned by Chevron), alleging that the companies violated environmental regulations and permitting requirements for decades. The (alleged) result? Disastrous degradation of the state’s vulnerable coastline. A Louisiana jury awarded Plaquemines Parish a judgement of $740 million against the company this past April.

Seeking to avoid liability, Chevron argues that since some of the crude oil Texaco produced on the sites in question was used to fulfill government contracts during World War II, it should be able to force the lawsuits into the federal court system, a venue considered to be more corporate-friendly in such litigation. Chevron’s argument is so absurd that it has even drawn the ire of some of Louisiana’s biggest fossil fuel advocates, including both Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and now-Governor Jeff Landry.

We don’t yet know how the Supreme Court will rule in Chevron v Plaquemines Parish, or to what degree it might grant fossil fuel companies their latest wish, but the case comes on the heels of a slate of anti-environmental and pro-corporate Supreme Court decisions from last term. One little discussed but very consequential case called Diamond Alternative Energy LLC v. Environmental Protection Agency might shed light on the Court’s amenability to the fuel industry’s arguments.

The Context

As we discussed back in March, Diamond Alternative Energy was at that point the latest in a barrage of anti-clean air litigation being rammed through the courts by corporate polluters seeking to evade present and future liability for toxic and planet-warming air pollution.

It is little consolation that the Supreme Court did not also take up a different case that the oil and gas industry was pushing, which would have given the Court the opportunity to take aim at Section 209 of the Clean Air Act. That provision authorizes the EPA to grant California waivers that enable the state to enforce more stringent emissions standards for certain classes of vehicles.

Instead, in Diamond Alternative Energy, the court addressed the question of whether fuel producers have standing to challenge Section 209. While not the worst case scenario for the Clean Air Act, it is likely to have dangerous consequences for the environment. It also opens the door for third-parties to claim standing to challenge regulations in a host of issue areas.

What Did SCOTUS Say?

Justice Brett Kavanaugh penned the majority opinion in Diamond Alternative Energy, creating out of seemingly whole cloth a new litmus test for standing that “commonsense inferences” about the behavior of regulated plaintiffs can allow unregulated parties to sue, even when such entities do not present evidence as to that impact. Ultimately, the ruling sketches out a significantly more expansive view of standing, if parties can predict cascading economic harm.

That view intrinsically privileges (already privileged) corporations before federal courts. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson intimated in her fiery dissent, it functionally adjusted standing requirements “to let certain litigants challenge the actions of the political branches” while maintaining that others are functionally ineligible to receive reprieve from harm.

Jackson also expressed “worry that the fuel industry’s gain [in this case] comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.” In cases stretching back decades, Jackson explored a slate of issues in which the Court refused to engage in the “speculation” of determining standing for various kinds of plaintiffs. The majority opinion in Diamond Alternative Energy tilted an already uneven playing field even further in favor of certain powerful entities like oil and gas conglomerates and other polluters.

Who Benefits?

Who wins in that imbalanced regime? We can look at who filed briefs in support of the plaintiffs to find out. These amici filers celebrated the decision as a huge win, with consequences for vulnerable people seeking protection from a litany of issues before the court.

The General Counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group, took to Twitter this summer to celebrate how the Supreme Court’s decision will empower its clients to selectively withhold basic healthcare from their employees, regardless of state law. Its amicus brief in the case expounds on how the wants of employers should invariably exceed the rights of the people they employ, and how redefining standing is crucial to achieving that project.

Advancing American Freedom similarly filed an amicus brief in Diamond Alternative Energy, arguing that the redefinition of standing would empower anti-abortion crusaders and parents seeking to strip their queer children of any safe spaces or basic affirmation that they might find at school. The organization’s argument is functionally founded on the idea that (conservative) parents should be able to use federal courts as a weapon to control school environments by enforcing the conditions of their particular religious affiliations and beliefs on their children—but also those of others—regardless of whether that is practicable, and whether evidenced “harm” to those parents has actually occurred.

As Justice Jackson concluded in her dissent: “If the Court privileges the interests of one class of litigants over others, even unintentionally, it can damage Americans’ faith in an impartial Judiciary and undermine the long-term credibility of its judgments. […] if the Court is not fastidious in maintaining consistency across its certiorari decisions and substantive rulings, its decisions will come to represent, like so many marble façades, another mere facsimile of justice.”

What Now?

Diamond Alternative Energy provided further confirmation that corporate polluters thinks that they should play by different rules. Unfortunately, the high court’s majority seems to agree. As we enter yet another year of consequential Supreme Court cases, Chevron USA Inc represents another industry request for preferential treatment that may well be granted.

If oil and gas companies (and other corporate conglomerates) are allowed to force states and counties into their courtroom of choice, it will only serve to further degrade the access that regular people have to even the pretense of justice.

Coming after the state legislature’s new law eliminating the interim carbon pollution reduction requirement, risking significant increased residential energy bills and putting North Carolinians on the financial hook for expensive new gas plants and unproven technologies. Duke Energy’s plan does not do enough to take advantage of cost saving energy efficiency and demand response and less polluting clean energy sources like solar, wind, and batteries.

Duke’s proposal is the first step in developing an updated plan to replace the 2024 Carbon Plan. The utilities commission is tasked with developing a plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The state legislative majority abandoned the goal set in the bipartisan 2021 North Carolina law to lower carbon pollution from power plants in the state by 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The plan filed by Duke Energy raises serious questions about whether the regulated monopoly is taking decisive enough action to comply with North Carolina law.

Interested parties have 180 days after the utility files with the N.C. Utilities Commission to file critiques of Duke’s plan. As part of its review, the commission will hold a public comment period, public hearings, and an evidentiary hearing.

A coalition of public interest groups—Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Sierra Club, and Vote Solar, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center—are parties to the utilities commission proceedings.

The clean energy advocates’ initial reactions to Duke’s proposed Carbon Plan follow.

Mikaela Curry, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Manager, said, “Duke’s proposal to delay coal retirements is a disappointing and unsettling departure from the utility’s previous commitments. The plants are still old and outdated, and increasingly unaffordable because of equipment, labor, and railway shortages. None of this has changed except Duke’s hunger for more money on the backs of hard-working families and small businesses, all in the name of delivering electricity to power-hungry data centers owned by the richest companies in the history of the world. Duke Energy has an obligation to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy for North Carolinians, and as its CEO, Harry Sideris should ensure his company is prioritizing clean, proven technology instead of putting his thumb on the scale in favor of burning coal longer or overbuilding new gas plants to benefit his worldwide monopoly utility shareholders.”

David Neal, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said, “We’re concerned that regulated monopoly Duke Energy is continuing to rely on expensive new gas power plants, leaving North Carolina families on the hook for escalating fuel costs and making it harder to reach the 2050 carbon neutrality requirement. Duke yet again appears to have fallen short of taking full advantage of energy efficiency, load flexibility, renewables, and storage, which remain the cheapest and fastest suite of options for meeting rising demand. As always, we will scrutinize Duke’s filing and explore better options for North Carolinians that reduce carbon pollution as quickly and affordably as possible.”

Jake Duncan, Vote Solar, said, “Today, Duke Energy published yet another plan that lets North Carolinians down. This is the third Carbon Plan that fails to meet the moment. Instead of investing enough in low-cost, fuel-free distributed clean energy resources like solar that strengthens communities and lower bills, Duke is doubling down on massive new methane gas plants and delaying coal retirements. The result will be higher costs for families, more pollution in local communities, and a worsening climate crisis.”

The heart was always off-limits to surgeons. Cutting into it spelled instant death for the patient. That is, until a ragtag group of doctors scattered across the Midwest and Texas decided to throw out the rule book. Working in makeshift laboratories and home garages, using medical devices made from scavenged machine parts and beer tubes, these men and women invented the field of open heart surgery. Odds are, someone you know is alive because of them. So why has history left them behind? Presented by Chris Pine, CARDIAC COWBOYS tells the gripping true story behind the birth of heart surgery, and the young, Greatest Generation doctors who made it happen.

In 2023, the coal plant’s particulate matter (PM) emissions allegedly exceeded EPA limits by 70%.","BOW, NH. – Merrimack Station, New England’s last coal-burning plant, has closed. News broke of the New Hampshire plant’s closure within 24 hours of the Trump administration announcing sweeping measures to revive the coal industry, including opening 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal mining leases, extending compliance deadlines, and rolling back health-improving safeguards against air and water pollution.

The closure comes three years ahead of the 2028 retirement date previously reached following negotiations with Sierra Club, The Conservation Law Foundation, EPA, and the plant’s owner Granite Shore Power. Granite Shore Power cited financial reasons for its move to shutter the plant and consider installing a large solar array and utility-scale batteries. No public announcement was made when the plant stopped producing power on September 12, and the process of shutting down is ongoing.

The Trump administration's “Coal Day 2.0” agenda will increase air pollution from coal plants across the country, negatively impacting public health in New Hampshire and the Northeast.

“The early retirement of Merrimack Station is further proof that the Trump Administration propping up aging, expensive coal power is political posturing and a handout for coal executives at the expense of American taxpayers,” said Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Director Laurie Williams

“Bow and the Capitol region can be comforted knowing Merrimack Station will no longer release unhealthy coal pollution into our air and damaging warm-water discharges into our river,” added Sierra Club New Hampshire Chapter Director Cathy Corkery. “Now, we look ahead to remediation of the Merrimack River and a clean, locally-powered solar array along its banks. When paired with battery storage, this new facility will provide our community with local, cleaner, healthier, and more reliable energy.”

Merrimack Station has had an outsized impact on local air and water quality, as the state’s largest single source of air pollution. In 2023, the coal plant’s particulate matter (PM) emissions allegedly exceeded EPA limits by 70%.

Note: A previous version implied that operations ceased on 9/29, however the plant stopped producing power on 9/12 and the operational shut down is ongoing. The news was first reported on 9/29.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 15:03:58.091160

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy's road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

""North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy's low energy rates continue to support this region's economic success,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.""

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan's future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company's recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan's projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

""We've also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,"" Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What's next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

Rebecca Speare-Cole

Wednesday 01 October 2025 04:42 EDT

Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, is expected to criticise Reform leaders for their pledge to ""declare war"" on green energy projects, arguing it would betray young people and future generations.

General Motors set an electric vehicle sales record in the third quarter, more than doubling sales year-over-year, ahead of the federal tax credit expiration.

GM reported Oct. 1 that it sold 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter in the U.S., compared with 32,095 last year at this time, further cementing GM's position as the second-largest seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. behind Tesla.

GM sold 710,347 vehicles in the quarter across its full lineup, an 8% change year over year.

The Detroit automaker also set record sales for gas-powered crossovers and SUVs across its brands, particularly redesigned models such as the Chevrolet Traverse, Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Acadia, GMC Terrain and Buick Enclave.

Buick faced double-digit losses in the quarter while Cadillac had its best quarter in over a decade, GM said.

Duncan Aldred, senior vice president and president of North America for GM, told the Detroit Free Press that the automaker set records in a quarter much stronger than anticipated.

“When the tariffs were announced, we thought there was a pull ahead effect, which would give a payback later on,” he said. “That payback hasn't really come.”

Tax credit boost

Similarly, Aldred said the company is sure of strong electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter despite another potential pull ahead sales effect from losing the tax credits.

Car buyers were eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 on qualifying new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 on a used EVs. President Donald Trump signed a bill in July pushing up the expiration date for the federal clean vehicle tax credit, which expired Sept. 30 instead of its original expiration date in 2032.

Car shopping experts forewarned that the rush of buyers would all but halt without the credit, though GM and Ford managed to find a workaround that allowed EVs intended for leasing to qualify ― while supplies last.

“We've invested an awful lot into what is an exceptional EV portfolio, the broadest in the industry,” Aldred said. “We love the products, the customers love the products, we think we can maintain a healthy level of sales going forward.”

Other sales results

GM sold 40,780 Buicks in the quarter, down 14%. Total Chevrolet sales of 458,189 rose 8%, and GMC sales increased 9% to 164,853 vehicles.

Cadillac sales leapt 25% in the quarter to 46,525.

The term that starts this year will include cases that touch on issues related to campaign finance, the environment, voting rights, and immigration, among others.

Seth Chandler, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said he feels the most important case that is coming this term is Trump v. Slaughter.

“It’s about the ability of the president to control what were previously called ‘independent agencies.’ These are things like the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, the Federal Election Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, all the agencies to which Congress has been delegated vast amounts of power over the past hundred years,” Chandler said. “And they’ve done so under the assumption that the president can’t fire people that he doesn’t like.”

However, Chandler said President Trump believes that those restrictions on his authority are unconstitutional.

“What the president wants ultimately is the ability to fire those people and replace them with people who are more persuaded of his ideology,” he said.

This is not the only case centering on Trump’s power as president this term. The case Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump is about the president’s tariffs, which he has passed without explicit authorization of Congress.

“Instead, what the president is relying on is a statute called the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which does give the president power to act in certain emergencies,” Chandler said. “And the thought is that this is really going beyond the expectations of Congress when they passed the statute and that the president shouldn’t be able to take such major actions without a clear statement from Congress that this is acceptable. The president takes the opposite view.”

Voting rights are also on the agenda this Supreme Court term, in a case called Louisiana v. Callais. This case centers on whether section two of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is constitutional.

“Louisiana believed that it needed to draw two districts of its seven in which African Americans would have a reasonable chance of getting their preferred candidate elected,” Chandler said. “But that doesn’t sound like race blindness of the sort that the court has said should apply in, for example, college admissions or elsewhere.

And so we have a tension between section two of the Voting Rights Act, which has been interpreted to require essentially race consciousness and notions of equal protection, which suggests that race should not be used except perhaps under the most extreme circumstances.”

The court will also likely rule on a case that will decide the constitutionality of Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship.

“The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that every person born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof is a citizen of the United States,” Chandler said. “Historically, that little qualifier, ‘subject to jurisdiction thereof,’ has been interpreted very, very narrowly to only apply, for example, to children of ambassadors or enemy aliens who have children while they’re here.”

The justices heard a case on this executive order last term, but didn’t rule on the executive order’s validity outright, Chandler said. Instead, they focused their ruling about the extent to which federal courts could offer relief.

But the case has now gone back down to lower courts and is very likely to rise up again to the Supreme Court.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/us-supreme-court-building-g7a3c1fd71_1280-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 13:03:55.921126

Shoppers rushed to take advantage of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit that expired Sept. 30, pushing up sales of pure battery-electric vehicles 21% from the prior-year period to a record 10% of overall deliveries, according to estimates from researcher Cox Automotive.

That momentum prompted Cox to bump up its forecast for the seasonally adjusted annual rate of U.S. sales to 16.1 million vehicles after a more modest upwards revision in June to 15.7 million.

Automakers whipsawed by policy changes have been dialing back EV production and rejiggering product plans to add more gas and hybrid models. That dynamic created a buyers’ market for EVs as manufacturers rushed to sell down inventory, and an interest-rate cut helped some shoppers shrug off lingering affordability concerns.

“It’s last call at the bar, everyone is stepping up and ordering,” said Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics for JD Power, which expects sales of about 16.1 million new vehicles this year. “If we weren’t having this experience in EVs right now, we might be asking, ‘Why are sales so sluggish on the combustion engine side?’ It’s perhaps masking a bit of weakness.”

The industry is pulling back the curtain on its performance Wednesday, when major automakers from General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. to Stellantis NV are expected to release U.S. vehicle sales results. EV maker Tesla Inc. is expected to report global figures on Thursday.

Ford’s US deliveries rose 8.2% in the quarter, driven by strong sales of sport-utility vehicles such as the Bronco, which rose 41%, and the newly redesigned Expedition large SUV, which was up more than 47%. The automaker’s EV sales set a quarterly record of 30,612 vehicles, up 30%. The highly profitable F-Series pickup trucks rose 4.7%.

Hyundai’s third-quarter total US sales climbed 13% to a record 239,069 vehicles, with EV sales doubling from a year ago. The gains were particularly pronounced in September, when its EV sales jumped 153% from the same month in 2024.

Regulation Rollback

Trump campaigned on rolling back many of former President Joe Biden’s EV-friendly policies, such as environmental regulations and the federal tax credit, and Congress followed through in July with a major tax-and-spending bill. As a result, 2026 will mark the first time in nearly 15 years that the federal government will not subsidize new EV purchases.

Most industry observers forecast a slowdown in EV sales in the coming quarters, as without the federal incentives they are still more expensive than gas-powered cars. EV average transaction prices rose in August to about $9,000 more than prices on conventional models.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said Tuesday in a speech in Detroit. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

Some EV proponents had looked to states including California to step in and replace the expiring federal EV tax credits. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, dashed those hopes with a Sept. 19 announcement that his state won’t replace the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit.

Some carmakers are stepping into the void. Hyundai said Wednesday that it would extend $7,500 cash incentives in October for 2025 models of its Ioniq 5 EV, while also lowering prices by as much as $9,800 on certain 2026 versions.

Tesla’s Model Y and 3, the Honda Prologue, Chevrolet Equinox, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mustang Mach-e were among the biggest beneficiaries of the EV surge in the first two months of the quarter, according to Cox. Ford, GM, Toyota and Hyundai continued to gain total market share in the period while Stellantis, owner of the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands, suffered small declines.

Many Chevy and Ford dealers’ websites have had a clock counting down to the second when the federal tax credit ends.

Rob Miles, a banker from Denver and a lifelong car enthusiast, said he’d been wanting to buy the electric Mustang Mach-e since it came out. The timing was finally right to get one in July.

The federal incentive and “the rebates that Ford was offering were extremely intriguing,” Miles said.

Beyond the incentive grab, there’s a sense of urgency among some shoppers that prices will go up on 2026 models as carmakers look to recoup some of the cost of the new tariff burden. Based on the trade agreements Trump announced this summer, Cox estimates the US government will collect roughly $100 billion in tariffs on imported autos, parts and materials this year. That could add an extra $5,500 to the cost of an imported vehicle, and $1,000 on US-assembled vehicles with imported components, according to Cox’s chief economist Jonathan Smoke.

Rather than jolt buyers with sticker shock, automakers have been eating some of the costs themselves while spreading the rest across their lineups. But new vehicles coming out for 2026 are already starting to show markups, said Carlos Hidalgo, who owns two Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep Ram stores and a Hyundai store in California. Now, he’s fretting that he will have trouble making up the lost EV volume.

“We had the rush with the electric stuff and the plug-in stuff, but that goes away, so we gotta figure out what we’re gonna do next,” said Hidalgo, who’s still waiting for the new hybrid Jeep Cherokee and new Grand Cherokee models to arrive at his stores.

Ongoing Uncertainty

Uncertainty around tariff costs is poised to spike again as the Trump administration looks to renegotiate the terms of its trading pact with Mexico and Canada next year. Regardless of where the levies ultimately land, manufacturers will feel it in their cost structures and look for other ways to cope beyond raising prices, such as stripping out features or revising trim levels, said Erin Keating, an executive analyst with Cox.

“Some add features but eliminate lower trims, shrinking the range of affordable options and pushing buyers toward more expensive models,” Keating said.

Still, there are positive drivers for the economy too, according to researcher Edmunds.com. Interest-rate cuts and deregulation are giving companies some flexibility on costs, and a strong stock market is giving people the confidence to buy, especially those who can afford a new car in the first place.

“We’re seeing more consumers return to the market with aging trade-ins, which is a strong signal that there’s still real pent-up demand,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. power company Duke Energy is considering adding large nuclear reactors to its fleet and extending the life of some coal plants as part of a long-term energy plan aimed at meeting sharply rising electricity demand in the Carolinas.

Electric utilities across the U.S. are boosting power infrastructure plans to account for rapid growth in electricity consumption, driven by AI data centers, the electrification of transportation and buildings as well as a resurgence in domestic manufacturing.

The recent surge in power use has sparked renewed interest in nuclear energy, which produces around-the-clock electrons that are virtually carbon-free.

""We're seeing energy needs over the next 15 years that are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the past 15 years,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president.

Duke’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan was filed with regulators on Wednesday and outlines its strategy through to 2040, updating the 2023 version that covered energy needs through 2038.

The plan includes a proposal to study the addition of large light-water reactors and small modular reactors, with potential sites at Belews Creek in North Carolina and the W.S. Lee site in South Carolina. Duke is targeting a 2037 in-service date for new nuclear generation.

If Duke moves forward with the nuclear part of its plan, the power utility would be building new reactors for the first time in decades.

The proposal is set against a backdrop of power consumption at record highs and U.S. President Donald Trump's push to roll back incentives for wind and solar development while promoting fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Duke said it will seek extensions of between two and four years for several coal plants with dual-fuel capability, citing recent federal policy changes. The company said it still intends to retire its ageing coal fleet as new resources come online.

“That extension helps bridge the gap,” said Glen Snider, Duke's managing director of integrated resource planning.

Duke is the largest operator of regulated nuclear power in the U.S. and among the biggest coal plant operators in the country.

The company also plans to more than double its battery storage capacity from earlier projections to 5,600 megawatts (MW) by 2034 and maintain its target for 4,000 MW of solar power capacity.

Wind power, the company said, is economically unviable for its customers through 2040.

The utility also plans to expand its natural gas fleet, adding two combustion turbines to the five combined cycle units proposed in its 2023 plan. It will increase liquefied natural gas storage to improve reliability and reduce fuel cost volatility.

Duke's proposed upgrades to existing nuclear and hydropower facilities will add nearly 600 MW of clean capacity.

30% Ford Says Expect EV Market To Half

Photo by: Ford

Man, EV companies can’t catch a break, huh? For a long time, U.S.-market EVs tended to be heavily reliant on Tesla for a lot of reasons; the cars themselves were kind of the only game in town that was worth a damn to the average consumer.

Range, price and general usability hit all of the sweet spots with consumers, especially with the (relatively) reasonably priced Model 3 and Model Y. Add in the tax credit, and it was a sweet time for Tesla.

But now that automakers are finally starting to catch up, they’ve been cut off at the knees. The tax credit was a large incentive for American car buyers, tacitly admitted by Ford CEO Jim Farley. According to reporting from Fortune, Farley said that the death of the EV tax credit could cut the industry in half:

Ford CEO Jim Farley, speaking at the Ford Pro Accelerate summit in Detroit on Tuesday, said he sees a huge impact from the policy change.

While he still sees EVs being a “vibrant industry” going forward, it’s also “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.” He called the end of the $7,500 consumer incentive a game-changer and said he wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5% of the industry from the current level of roughly 10% to 12%. The most recent forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData estimated that EVs would account for 12.2% of new-vehicle sales in September 2025.

Farley reminded the audience that he always says, “The customers are pesky. They surprise you.” And what he’s learned is that “customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”

On one hand, this feels like a complete no-brainer. Until relatively recently, EV efforts from most companies that aren’t Tesla have been aimed at the upper-class buyer. A $75,000 car, no matter if it’s electric or not, is a hard sell in today’s world, where buyers feel incredibly squeezed by an increased cost of living.

On the other hand, Ford is right around the corner when it comes to introducing its reasonably priced EV project. There’s a world of difference between its planned $30,000 and the $75,000 example Farley mentioned in conversation. Having that hurt at the knees isn’t great for our EV market.

Fortune implied that Ford still sees electrification in general as the way forward for the U.S. market.

“Partial electrification is more interesting to customers than we thought…we think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with.” And they’re falling out of love with pure-play EVs, he implied.

Still, this isn't great news for the EV market and all of the supply chain that has been building up to support what everyone thought would be a boon in new American electric vehicle manufacturing. The world will continue to go electric, so let’s hope this is temporary.

60% Tesla Has Already Updated Its Lease Pricing

Photo by: Patrick George

While other brands, local dealerships, and other entities are scrambling to update their incentives and sales pricing, there’s no slacking at Tesla. Initially spotted by Reuters and confirmed by us, Tesla has already changed its lease pricing on its new EV models:

Tesla and its rivals had been passing these credits on to customers through competitive lease offers.

The monthly lease of the electric vehicle manufacturer's best-selling Model Y increased to a range between $529 and $599, from a range of $479 to $529. Prices of all vehicles, however, remain unchanged. Model 3 lease prices touched a range of $429 to $759 per month, from a range of $349 to $699.

Demand for battery-powered models is already showing signs of a slowdown after rapid growth earlier in the decade. Sales could drop after the credits dry up, auto executives and analysts have warned.

As a person who looks at the glass as half full, these prices don’t seem like too much of a stretch. A jump from $349 to $429 for the Tesla Model 3 isn’t insignificant, especially for buyers on a budget, but this still feels relatively competitive against similarly priced ICE premium sedans.

Purchase prices for the cars haven’t changed, and some Teslas, like the Model S and Model X, were too expensive to qualify for purchase-level tax credits anyway.

90% Tax Credit Claims Weren’t Always Lease-Only

It’s no secret that the EV tax credit really helped with leasing. Not long ago, before the credit died entirely, new legislation meant reconfiguring the application of the credit, no longer allowing for use on new purchases of cars not made in North America.

But that didn’t apply to vehicles owned or run by commercial entities, creating a clever loophole for banks and leases. Thus, the $7,500 credit could be applied to leases, bringing down the initial cost and monthly payment. Thus, you'd think that most, if not all, EV purchases would be leased, right?

Well, no. According to data from Experian (and reported on by Automotive News), the actual ratios may be a little less cut and dried:

The Tesla Model Y was the top-selling electric vehicle in the second quarter of 2025 but only 30 percent of those sales were for leases, according to Experian. About half of all Model Y customers financed their purchase with a loan.

In contrast, the Chevrolet Equinox EV was the third-most-popular EV in the quarter, and 60 percent of those purchases were leases.

Other models quoted, like the Model 3, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Ford Mustang Mach-E, hovered around a 60%-ish lease rate.

Interestingly, Automotive News says that on average, EV leases were $175 cheaper per month than EV loans.

100% Is The Death Of The EV Tax Credit Overblown?

The incentives to both buy and build zero-emission cars are gone for now, but we haven’t quite reached price parity en masse for EVs and ICE cars. It seems like we were getting close, but the little bit of assistance to get us over the line is now totally gone.

And yet the world continues to electrify. I’m not going to assert that the tax credit did nothing. But in a world where people shop for cars primarily based on their monthly payments, did those deals help as much as, say, a cheaper EV in general?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/E6YN7B/s1/ford-cm.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 12:08:28.451932

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas ""helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.""

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cellphones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world's largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The administration spent $400 million US of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner.

Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15 per cent cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

$182M US of debt service deferred

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million US on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million US of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada's Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion US federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries.

GM has pledged more than $900 million US to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build one million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, said Thacker Pass is a ""massive opportunity"" for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

As of October 1, Rivian has updated lease prices for all trims of its R1 EVs – some are now less expensive, while others are more expensive. See how it all breaks down below.

As promised by the current administration, the $7,500 federal tax credit for certain EV purchases has completely ended (cue the collective “boo”). It was a good run while it lasted, and many US consumers were able to more easily go all-electric thanks to those incentives.

Where do we go from here?

While some automakers (mostly those in Japan) have significantly dialed back electrification strategies, others are pushing forward. Better yet, BEV-only automakers like Lucid Motors are extending the $7,500 credit themselves.

Not all Rivian prices previously qualified for federal tax credits, but the American automaker still offered plenty of lease and purchase incentives of its own and continues to do so. However, with the tax credit now a fleeting memory, my first thought was how much it would affect lease prices at Rivian, for instance, so I looked into it.

As of today, some Rivian lease prices are significantly less expensive, while others have been increased. It all depends on what trim you’re looking for.

Rivian lease prices as of October 1, 2025

With tax incentives in the rearview, it will be up to individual EV automakers to offer lease and purchase deals on their models. As we previously covered, Rivian was offering customers excellent lease incentives until the witching hour of September 30, 2025.

A day later, we are navigating a world without those government perks (or any government at all due to a looming shutdown). However, there is a bright side – Rivian leases are still available, and the prices of some variants have actually gone down.

As promised, here are the current lease prices for the 2025 Rivian R1S and R1T trims, effective October 1. We’ve also included the previous price as of September 30, for comparison. Note that all numbers are starting prices with all standard included components – zero upgrades.

There you have it. The highest hike in lease prices we’re seeing is on the Tri Motor version of the Rivian R1T. There are still plenty of deals coming from Rivian in the future as the American automaker continues to grow and expand its lineup.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Rivian-lease-prices-R1T.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-01 12:06:00.847704

Meanwhile, Tesla, which is facing a constantly eroding market share due to stale product lines and its CEO's political activity, has chosen a different path. Reuters reports this morning that lease prices for the Model Y and Model 3 have gone up.

A Model Y lease would have cost between $479 and $529 per month to lease yesterday; today, that price range is $529–$599 a month.

The companies didn’t disclose the purchase price for the turbines, which have combined capacity to power about 500,000 homes. Siemens Energy will deliver the first of the turbines in early 2026 and the new plants are expected to supply the central US grid operated by the Southwest Power Pool, which serves more than 18 million people in 14 states.

Xcel is building the plants as Texas faces unprecedented demand for electricity from data centers, oil production and the state’s overall economic growth. The region, like much of the US, has aging infrastructure that’s increasingly being tested by extreme storms and wildfires. Now demand for AI is adding to the strain, forcing companies to quickly upgrade the grid while trying to keep power reliable and affordable for customers.

As a result, orders for gas turbines are increasing, with Siemens Energy, GE Vernova Inc. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. ranking as the dominant manufacturers of large gas turbines.

The Department of Energy’s new reactor pilot program is not just another research initiative. It represents a bold experiment to see if advanced nuclear can move from concepts to real projects, and do so rapidly. If successful, this program could redefine how the United States develops nuclear energy; if it fails, it may reinforce lingering doubts about the ability of the U.S. to build next-generation nuclear projects at scale.

Established under one of the four executive orders signed May 23, 2025, the program directs DOE to authorize advanced reactor demonstration projects outside of national labs, and is aimed at achieving “criticality” for at least three test reactors by July 4, 2026. A request for applications was issued on June 18 and initial selections followed on Aug. 12, with DOE picking 11 projects from 10 companies. Subsequent applications are permitted on a rolling basis.

Crucially, these reactors will be authorized solely by DOE, bypassing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as permitted under DOE’s authority under the Atomic Energy Act. The companies must self-finance each project, from design through decommissioning, and select their own sites.

The program could succeed in multiple ways.

Fast-track from lab to launch. By setting a clear deadline of three reactors nearing criticality in just over a year, DOE is stepping up to bridge the gap between design and operation. This is a departure from nuclear’s usual timeline of many years, even a decade, from licensing through construction.

Unlocking private capital. Investor interest in nuclear energy has grown, but regulatory, cost and construction schedule uncertainty has so far slowed turning the interest into project finance for advanced nuclear in the U.S. DOE’s pilot approach provides timely government authorization and a clearer path to future NRC licensing. That clarity reduces perceived risk and could catalyze private equity, infrastructure funds, and utility investment.

U.S. reclaims strategic leadership. China and Russia have operating advanced reactors, and countries like Canada, the U.K. and France are pursuing SMRs aggressively. A rapid U.S. demonstration fleet signals that America intends to compete both economically and geopolitically in nuclear energy.

Why this could be a game-changer

If even one of these pilot reactors goes critical and demonstrates commercial operation safely, the impact could be transformational. It would prove that modular reactor designs can work at scale, supply investors with real-world reference projects and shift broader planning from “concept” to “commission.” In energy policy terms, it could start a nuclear renaissance, firming up the electrification and clean power goals of the 2030s and beyond. It could also help solve critical data center power needs as those needs expand beyond our current ability to power them.

However, this program carries a risk that must not be ignored. By relying solely on DOE authorization and bypassing NRC oversight, there is a real danger that the public may perceive these test reactors as subject to diluted safety standards, especially if DOE staffing or technical capacity is diminished. If nuclear technology is associated with any regulatory loosening or political interference, it could erode public trust in nuclear safety, which is a trust that took decades of careful regulation to build.

This is more than a theoretical risk, it’s existential for the industry. Public confidence in nuclear regulation underpins everything from site licensing to financial underwriting. Without preserving institutional integrity at DOE and NRC, accelerated deployment could come undone in the courtroom, in the markets or in the media.

An additional pragmatic note is that many of these pilot projects involve modular or micro-reactors using novel designs, while at the same time we are seeing efforts to restart shuttered light-water reactor sites as the lowest-hanging fruit to bridge the gap until SMRs or micro-reactors can be commercially operational. This makes sense strategically — leveraging existing grid connections, workforce and regulatory familiarity — but it underscores the importance of ensuring that legacy licensing frameworks and safety standards remain rigorously applied.

Any misstep in the LWR restarting process or any other near-term, nuclear-adjacent activity, like fuel production or plutonium storage and transportation, could undermine the support and momentum that is currently propelling advanced nuclear projects.

Oversight must remain solid

Nuclear energy’s promise must always be balanced by an unshakable commitment to safety. While advanced reactor programs offer the potential for cleaner, more reliable power, the handling of nuclear fuel and materials is not a challenge that can be rushed or minimized. Each step in the nuclear regulatory oversight process should meet the highest standards, including dismantling retired nuclear warheads and storing plutonium, as well as managing the spent fuel from our existing fleet of reactors.

Each of these steps reflects a hard-earned truth — nuclear fission material remain hazardous for decades or even centuries, and they demand the highest standards of care.

If public confidence is to grow alongside investment in new nuclear technology, safety in fuel management and long-term storage must be non-negotiable. Moving too quickly, or lowering oversight in the name of speed, risks repeating past mistakes and undermining the very future this program is designed to build.

Depending on who you ask, this is either good news or bad, but automakers are probably not happy that this incentive has gone away, though two giant manufacturers are working to extend a $7,500 discount for customers.

Reuters reports that both Ford and GM are signing their dealerships up for a program that would extend this generous federal discount on vehicles that are leased, good news for drivers in search of a good deal.

According to this report, “Each company in recent days has rolled out programs to their retailers under which the automaker's financing arm would initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory by making down payments on them, according to dealers briefed on the previously unreported programs and documents from the companies.” By having their retail partners “purchase” these vehicles, they can lock in the $7,500 tax credit. Dealers could then lease these cars and trucks to customers and roll that federal discount into the payment plan.

A Brief Reprieve For Electric Vehicle Buyers

This sounds like a bit of financial chicanery, but apparently it’s all on the up-and-up. And as GM told Reuters, “We worked with our GM dealers on an extended offer for customers to benefit from the tax credit for leases.” Similarly, the blue oval is providing generous retail lease rates to customers, deals that are expected to last through the end of December.

Apparently, both automakers discussed these plans with the Internal Revenue Service, so everything appears to be kosher.

A new scorecard ranks U.S. states on climate risks to public health and health care systems

Vermont leads the country in readiness; West Virginia ranks last in climate preparedness, the study says

States with strong clean energy policies are better equipped to protect public health

WEDNESDAY, Oct. 1, 2025 (HealthDay News) — A new Commonwealth Fund report offers the first state-by-state ranking of how vulnerable individual health and health care systems are to climate risks.

The report analyzed all 50 states and Washington, D.C., looking at factors like extreme heat, flooding and air quality, as well as policies to combat these threats.

Vermont was ranked the best state for its climate preparedness and low health risk, while West Virginia ranked last. States in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest generally scored well, while several states in the South and Southwest ranked among the worst.

Washington

New Jersey

Bottom 10 States

The report found a clear correlation.

“Our scorecard shows that states with strong clean energy and resilience policies are doing a better job protecting health and health care infrastructure, while other states leave patients exposed during potential crises,” said study author Matthew Eckelman, an associate professor at Northeastern University in Boston.

Some areas face unique dangers.

Southwestern states like Arizona and New Mexico have the greatest risk from extreme heat, while health infrastructure in low-lying coastal states like Florida and Louisiana has a high flood risk.

Florida has the nation’s highest percentage of hospital beds — nearly 15% — located in high-hazard flood zones, the study showed.

Extreme weather events are devastating and costly.

Last year alone, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported 27 weather and climate disasters with damage topping $1 billion in each. These disasters resulted in 568 direct or indirect deaths, making 2024 the eighth-highest fatality year in the last 45 years.

Commonwealth Fund President Joseph Betancourt stressed the basic necessity of climate readiness.

“People are better off when they can breathe clean air and when the hospitals they depend on are prepared for extreme weather,” he said in a news release.

The study authors urged states to take four key steps to reduce harmful health impacts and improve resilience:

Strengthen clean energy and energy efficiency policies.

Support health care facilities in preparing for extreme weather and assessing climate risks.

Require standardized reporting of health care sector emissions to guide improvements.

Help hospitals and clinics invest in resilient infrastructure, clean power and low-emission transportation for staff and patients.

Founded by Jodee Smith, FARMWISE Indiana mobilizes a team of seasoned value chain professionals located throughout the state. Their mission: connect Indiana’s farmers and food producers with institutional buyers, including schools, universities, restaurants, retail outlets and health care providers by increasing access to value-based procurement pathways.

“FARMWISE Indiana is about building relationships that benefit everyone from farmers and food producers to the communities they nourish,” said Smith. “We’re focused on making local food a bigger part of Indiana’s economy and identity.”

With a focus on sustainability, industry engagement and economic resilience, the program promotes local food procurement that supports small and mid-sized farms while meeting the growing demand for fresh, regional products.

The initiative seeks to grow institutional demand and create reliable markets, fostering a more connected, climate-resilient and locally rooted food economy.

According to the USDA Ag Census, sales from farmers to wholesale buyers increased 280% from 2017 to 2022, totaling more than $305 million.

More than 50% of food service buyers surveyed define local as being grown or made in Indiana.

Those 200 buyers are spending more than $550 million purchasing food each year. Substituting food grown and made in Indiana can boost the state's food economy.

According to the survey, buyers are motivated to buy local because of quality, freshness and taste; however, lack of time and challenges buying local through distributors are the top barriers for buyers.

The FARMWISE Indiana project is funded by a grant from Builders’ Initiative and has many partners in the state, including the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, Indiana State Department of Health, Indiana State Department of Education, Purdue Extension, Sustainable Agriculture, Research and Education through the USDA, Northwest Indiana Food Council, Northeast Indiana Local Food Network, Food and Growers Association, Urban Seeds, Fischer Farms LLC and Partners in Food and Farming.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/madisoncourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b1f849ba-dcd8-11ea-9099-4387d0bdd6af.png?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-10-01 13:03:46.436355

when women in boardrooms or at the helm of major institutions were a rarity. In assembling our biennial list of the Most Powerful Women in Washington, we had the opposite problem: We came across so many impressive, talented, and influential women that we could have filled many more pages.

We read, researched, and reached out to people in the know across the DC area, from business to media to politics, and asked for names of women in their particular field of expertise or beyond whom they considered powerful. Who is making things happen and having an impact? Who gets her calls (or texts or emails) returned immediately? Who is leading the way in her field? Who has senators on speed dial—and vice versa?

The list of nearly 250 women that follows includes a range of categories, with both those who are in the headlines—White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, for instance—as well as others pulling strings quietly behind the scenes. More than once, we heard from a source, “This is the most powerful woman you’ve never heard of.” Or “She won’t be on any other list but has real power.”

Some women in Washington have power by virtue of their position or their proximity or access to power. Some for their leadership. Some for their ability to mobilize vast networks and connections to make things happen. Some for the skill, expertise, or innovation they bring to their field.

Of course, politics tilts the scales here, especially in these acutely partisan times. That means the list right now includes many Republicans, especially Trump-aligned Republicans who are filling the majority of top government positions, as well as those from both parties who are pushing back against the MAGA agenda and making their voices heard. We know that some of the women on this list, especially those in the national spotlight, can be seen as controversial, polarizing figures. We don’t aim to pass judgment on the job they’re doing or whether they’re using their power to further the public good. We simply mean to present a snapshot of the women who, in the fall of 2025, are wielding—or in some cases challenging—the levers of power in the nation’s capital.

Fort Worth Report is certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative for adhering to standards for ethical journalism.","An energy giant is set to break ground for a data center project across about 430 acres in southeast Fort Worth amid concerns about noise pollution and declining value of nearby homes and businesses.

On Sept. 30, City Council members unanimously approved Black Mountain Power LLC’s request to amend the zoning of 119 acres that will allow for the project to move forward. The council previously approved related zoning changes for 312 acres.

Tuesday’s vote allows the land located at the southeast corner of Lon Stephenson Road and Forest Hill Drive to be used for light industrial.

In January, the company first requested council members approve a zoning change of 141 acres to light industrial. The company then acquired an additional 171 acres, also approved by council members in June.

Describing it as one of the “largest economic developments” in Tarrant County’s history, Black Mountain Energy LLC CEO Rhett Bennett said the project will benefit Fort Worth by providing millions in local taxes and thousands of job opportunities.

But several speakers said the project would hurt nearby businesses and natural areas, namely Weston Gardens, which sits roughly a hundred yards from the site.

“There will always be another opportunity for a data center in this day and time but never another place like Weston Gardens,” the garden center’s president Jackson Weston said.

Noise, light and air pollution generated by the data center will threaten the garden and its viability as a venue for the public to enjoy, said Jackson Weston and his mother, Sue Weston, the garden center’s founder and owner.

“No one wants to go to a garden that’s not peaceful and quiet,” she said.

Bennett assured council members that concerns about noise and traffic congestion were taken into consideration by implementing a “buffer” between the data center and nearby homes and properties. A floodplain between the data center and garden will contribute to mitigating noise disturbances, he said.

“We want to be thoughtful and be good neighbors regarding any noise or visibility issues,” Bennett said.

Jackson Weston questioned where Black Mountain Power would pull an adequate amount of water to power the digital facility, considering Weston Gardens relies on groundwater.

“If they’re denied city water due to restrictions, will they drill wells and deplete our water table?” Weston said.

When called to the dais, Bennett told council members Black Mountain Power has no plans to drill well water and will rely on Fort Worth’s municipal water supply.

Depending on a project’s resource needs, developers may be required to upgrade water transmission lines prior to construction, water department director Chris Harder told the council.

Paris Sanchez, a former landscape architect with Weston Gardens, agreed with Bennett on the benefits brought by data centers.

But those advantages come at “tremendous” environmental costs, Sanchez said, such as the amount of electricity required to power the facilities.

Electric consumption varies depending on the size of a data center, Mohammad Islam, University of Texas at Arlington assistant professor of computer science and engineering, told the Fort Worth Report. Data centers processing artificial intelligence, for example, require hundreds of megawatts of electricity.

About 16,400 homes in the United States can be powered on 100 megawatts.

Increased electricity use such as that from a data center can strain local energy infrastructure, Islam said.

Residents residing near the data center’s planned site lost power for three days during the February 2021 freeze in Texas that impacted millions, Sanchez told the council.

High demands for electricity, including those from constantly operating data centers and aging infrastructure, leaves the community susceptible to outages, Sanchez added.

While the water utility will service Black Mountain Power, data centers tend to have a greater impact on statewide resources rather than local supplies due to the amount of water required to generate electricity at this magnitude, Islam explained.

“You are not just getting power from one single energy source like one power plant but, rather, you are taking power from all of these different power plants,” Islam said.

Fort Worth resident Jessica Gonzalez stressed the importance of protecting Weston Gardens as a natural area.

Speakers said they worry that air pollution generated by the data center will compromise residents’ health, the local ecosystem and prompt habitat loss.

“Development and innovation are all inevitable … but at the same time, I think it is vitally important to protect the green spaces that we’ve got,” Gonzalez said. “I’m very, very concerned about the adverse effect that it could have on Weston Gardens (and) the surrounding areas … that mean so much to me and to other Fort Worthians.”

Before unanimously approving the zoning change, council member Jeanette Martinez was echoed by council members Deborah Peoples, Elizabeth Beck and Mayor Mattie Parker in her call for Fort Worth officials to consider an ordinance that creates limits and restrictions for data centers.

“I’m genuinely concerned about the number of data centers establishing themselves in the city of Fort Worth,” Martinez said. “Data centers require a significant amount of energy and water to operate.”

As part of his approval for the site plan, council member Chris Nettles, who represents the area, said he wants to ensure that Fort Worth officials meet the concerns of its residents and those in adjacent cities, such as Everman, Kennedale and Forest Hill.

“It is incumbent on the city of Fort Worth to make sure that, number one, we take care of the water and, number two, that we’re good neighbors,” Nettles said. “I’m very confident that the buffer will be enough to support between (Weston Gardens) versus the data center.”

Overall, EV drivers pay much less on average to fuel their vehicles, which gives EVs a major cost savings advantage in this category.
10 ways EV drivers can keep saving money There are many ways that EV drivers can keep reducing their daily costs.","The total cost of owning an electric vehicle changed on Oct. 1, 2025. That’s when no one could use the federal tax credits for new clean vehicles (a.k.a. 30D in the federal tax code), used clean vehicles (25E), and commercial clean vehicles (45W). These tax credits were designed to lower the upfront cost of EV purchases through 2032, and their early termination is likely to have a big impact on the EV market in the immediate future. However, there are still so many benefits of driving an EV that will never go away. EVs can be super easy to charge at home, fun to drive, and are better for the environment.

The total cost of ownership for a vehicle (also known as a TCO analysis) includes not only the upfront cost of the vehicle but also the maintenance, insurance, fuel, and registration costs that a driver can expect to pay every year. With the end of the tax credits and other recent market and policy changes, it’s worth revisiting this total cost and taking a deep dive into each category.

Calculating the total cost of vehicle ownership

For this analysis, we compared the gas and electric versions of the 2025 Chevrolet Equinox LT. These two cars are nearly identical, except for their fuel source, making them good for comparison. We also calculated the total costs for an EV with the tax credit for new clean vehicles (30D), which gave buyers a credit of $7,500 towards a vehicle purchase.

The bottom-line findings: The EV purchased with the tax credit had the lowest total cost, the EV purchased without the tax credit had the next-lowest cost, and the gas vehicle was the most expensive to own.

Each section below explains our methodology and the changes impacting each category.

The vehicle purchase cost

More than 80% of new car purchases are financed, so we included financing in our calculations. We assumed a loan duration of 5 years, an interest rate of 10%, and a down payment of 20%. Some automakers offer financing deals, and an interest rate of 5% could save the EV driver up to $4,000 on financing costs. We also assumed a sales tax of 7.6%, consistent with the national average. We used formulas from PlugStar.com to calculate the amount due at signing and the monthly loan payment.

The loss of the new vehicle tax credit greatly increased the financing cost for an EV, raising it above the cost of financing a gas vehicle. However, our financing cost did not include any non-federal incentives. There are still opportunities to take advantage of state and local tax incentives or other deals that can lower the upfront cost of a vehicle. Tariffs will very likely have an effect on new vehicle prices soon, regardless of drivetrain, but it’s unclear what the exact effects will be.

Vehicle maintenance

Over 10 years, the owner of the EV would save about $2,416 in maintenance costs compared to the gas car. We used AAA’s Your Driving Costs to calculate the maintenance costs for each car and assumed that it is driven 12,200 miles per year, the national average in 2023 according to KBB. EVs are cheaper to maintain because they have fewer moving parts and fewer fluids to replace. The battery can last 20 years or more, and the motor and electronics require little to no regular maintenance. This leads to fewer repairs needed and lower maintenance costs overall.

Car insurance

The EV owner in this scenario would pay about $3,360 more in insurance costs over 10 years. We again used AAA’s Your Driving Costs to find a yearly estimate for full-coverage insurance for an EV and compact SUV. EVs can be more expensive to insure than gas cars if they have a higher MSRP, requiring a higher level of insurance. And although EVs have fewer moving parts that require repairs, if the car ever needs to be repaired, it might need specialized parts that are shipped from other states. These increased insurance costs might be growing pains of the early EV market and could decrease over time.

Registration and additional fees

License and title fees are the same for both cars, so we estimated $90 for the initial registration year. We estimated $52 for registration each year after that, based on state averages.

However, in many states, there are additional fees that EV drivers have to pay for registration or charging. This is because gas cars contribute to state and federal highway revenue through gas taxes, while there is no equivalent fuel tax for EVs (although EV drivers pay into the system in other ways). The federal tax on gasoline has not been raised since 1993, which is partially why our transportation funding is lagging behind. In some states, the revenue from EV taxes goes towards charging infrastructure. There have also been recent proposals at the federal level to add hefty EV fees.

The National Conference of State Legislatures tracks EV and hybrid fees in each state, and we estimated an annual EV fee of $120 from this data. EV drivers pay more in road user fees than gas car drivers pay in gas taxes in at least 32 states, according to Atlas Public Policy. EV drivers want to pay their fair share for transportation funding, but these fees should not be punitive, as many of them are right now.

Electricity costs

When it comes to fueling up, EV drivers almost always have a financial advantage. Over 10 years, it costs more than twice as much to fuel a gas car as to charge an EV, for a total savings of $7,523 for the EV driver. We used an average residential electricity rate of about 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. We also assumed that 12% of charging occurred at public charging stations at an average rate of 48 cents per kilowatt-hour. Drivers who use public charging more often would pay more in fuel costs, since public charging electricity rates are higher than residential rates.

Residential electricity costs have risen in recent years due to increased load from AI data centers and air conditioning, decreased incentives for renewable energy generation, and the repeal of funding appropriated for grid upgrades. Gasoline prices are also artificially low, since the U.S. pays around $31 billion annually in direct fossil fuel subsidies, much more than any subsidies for renewable energy. Gas prices today don’t reflect these subsidies or the negative societal costs of fossil fuels, such as air pollution, which contributes to and exacerbates health issues like asthma.

Electricity and gasoline costs vary greatly by state. The Zero Emission Transportation Association’s ‘Electricity vs Gasoline Calculator’ breaks down fuel savings for an EV versus a gas car. These annual savings can range from 13% to over 60% depending on the state, using the Chevrolet Equinox as an example. Overall, EV drivers pay much less on average to fuel their vehicles, which gives EVs a major cost savings advantage in this category.

10 ways EV drivers can keep saving money

There are many ways that EV drivers can keep reducing their daily costs. Here are 10 of our favorites:

Consider buying a used EV – buyers are getting great deals!

Look up EV purchase and charging incentives available from your utility, state, and city. These incentives are easy to search on PlugStar.com.

See if your vehicle manufacturer or utility offers discounts on charging equipment.

If you live in multifamily housing, look for incentives that might cover the cost of installing charging at multifamily properties from your state, city, or utility.

Charge at home if you can, and consider using a Level 1 or low-power Level 2 home charger to meet your daily needs.

Use free public chargers, which are easy to search for on PlugShare.

Find out if your workplace offers free or low-cost EV charging.

Learn about managed charging options from your local utility, and take advantage of time-of-use rates to save money during peak periods.

Install vehicle-to-building or vehicle-to-grid charging to power your home or get credits from your utility. Many EV drivers integrate solar panels into this system.

Do your research along the way to get great deals on every purchase and service!

If you can’t currently charge at home, there are still ways to save money with an EV. You can advocate for right-to-charge policies in your state or city, which will give drivers who live in condos, apartments, or HOAs the right to install charging stations if they meet baseline requirements. Drivers don’t have to pay the installation costs by themselves; many states, cities, and utilities offer incentives for charging installation at multifamily housing. Although charging at home has the highest cost-saving potential, many utilities, municipalities, companies, and organizations are working to make charging more affordable and accessible for everyone.

In July, TTU System established a partnership with Fermi America to create what they described as one of the most significant power campuses in the US and the largest advanced energy, private grid and intelligence development in the world. The Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus aims to support the growing demands of artificial intelligence (AI), data innovation and sustainable energy. It will be located in the Texas Panhandle and will include 18m square feet of data centres and generate up to 11 GWe of IT capacity from natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear energy.

Under the first LOI, Siemens Energy is to deliver in 2026 three F-class SGT6-5000F gas turbines capable of producing up to 1.1 GWe in combined cycle mode. These are designed for round-the-clock, base-load power, and add to Fermi’s total of 2 GWe of already secured or contracted natural gas generation capacity for the site.

The second LOI envisages collaboration on Siemens nuclear steam turbines, generators, and control systems. These would be integrated into Fermi’s nuclear portfolio, which is expected to include four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors. In August, Fermi America, co-founded by former US Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry, also signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction to develop the nuclear component the hypergrid.

The project is seen as central to the Trump administration’s energy dominance agenda. “Winning the AI arms race doesn’t just take software developers. It takes more electricity,” said Doug Burgum, chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council.

“No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,” said Fermi Co-Founder Rick Perry. “The Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and Department of Defense are all working tirelessly to secure America’s position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions.”

Toby Neugebauer, Fermi America CEO and Co-Founder, noted: “Fermi America is doing what it takes 24/7 to build exactly what the President has asked for – highly reliable, unshakable, base load energy- through our 11 GW gas-bridged nuclear build. We understand the stakes are high and we are playing to win – because that’s how America keeps its AI edge.”",https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/10/Fermi_America__Rendering_of_the_Fermi_America_Campus.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 14:04:37.357610

The estimate is based on the 45Q tax credit, a federal program that pays companies $85 per metric ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored from industrial and power facilities.
The data lists a total of 43 carbon capture and storage projects and 10 pipelines that will function to transport captured carbon.
Prior to the act, the maximum tax credit available for carbon oxides that were permanently sequestered through EOR projects or other utilization methods was $60 per ton.
For the Ascension Clean Energy Facility in Ascension Parish, a projected capacity to capture 12 million tons annually could generate over $1 billion per year in tax credits.","(The Center Square) – Louisiana’s industrial giants could net more than $3.5 billion in federal tax credits if their carbon capture and sequestration projects move forward as planned.

The estimate is based on the 45Q tax credit, a federal program that pays companies $85 per metric ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored from industrial and power facilities.

According to project data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project, at least 17 announced projects in Louisiana’s chemical, refining, and liquified natural gas sectors would qualify under the “industry and power” and “direct air capture” category of the credit.

In total, those 17 projects are estimating that some 42 million tons of carbon dioxide would be captured, either for storage or to be reused in other industrial projects.

The data lists a total of 43 carbon capture and storage projects and 10 pipelines that will function to transport captured carbon. Twenty-two of the projects listed include regional “hubs,” an infrastructural network that “takes carbon dioxide from several emitting sources, such as heavy industries and power, and then transports and stores it using common infrastructure,” according to the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.

The 45Q incentive applies once a qualifying project either locks captured carbon underground in approved geological sites – such as saline formations or depleted oil and gas reservoirs – or puts the carbon to work as an input for making low-carbon fuels, chemicals, or construction materials.

The 45Q credit was strengthened in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and reaffirmed this summer in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump. Prior to the act, the maximum tax credit available for carbon oxides that were permanently sequestered through EOR projects or other utilization methods was $60 per ton.

Some of the largest projects carry the biggest potential payouts.

For the Ascension Clean Energy Facility in Ascension Parish, a projected capacity to capture 12 million tons annually could generate over $1 billion per year in tax credits.

For the Air Products Darrow Blue Energy Facility in Ascension Parish and the St. Rose Blue Ammonia Facility in St. Charles Parish, each could receive about $425 million annually.

G2 Net-Zero Energy Complex in Cameron Parish would be eligible for roughly $340 million per year.

Several other ammonia, methanol, and LNG facilities – including Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex, Cameron LNG Facility, and CF Industries/Mitsui Gulf Coast Blue Ammonia Plant – would qualify for between $85 million and $170 million annually.

Several other ventures, such as Commonwealth LNG, Big Lake Fuels, and Methanex Geismar Methanol, have not disclosed projected capture volumes, meaning the ultimate credit tally could climb even higher, according to the Project.",https://thehayride.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/carbon-capture.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 03:58:55.438395

“Over the next six months, CBA will work closely with workforce development consultants and local partners to evaluate and incorporate leading educational programs into the final Climate Service Corps design,” the CBA statement concluded.
Massachusetts Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer said in the announcement statement last week that “Massachusetts is full speed ahead on creating good-paying, meaningful clean energy jobs.” “Today, MassCEC is making our vision for a Climate Service Corps a reality.
This creates a clear pathway — from recruitment and skill development to hands-on climate service and work experience in permanent career placements,” MassCEC said.","LOWELL — The Healey-Driscoll administration and other officials formally launched the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s Climate Service Corps last week, and with it comes grant funding for a Lowell-based organization to design a program to train young people in sustainable building.

Coalition for a Better Acre was one of four organizations from across the state to receive this year’s Climate Service Corps grant award, with $50,000 going to the organization to help it focus on “training local young people in sustainable building operations in public and affordable housing in the Greater Lowell area.”

The program designed by CBA will be done in conjunction with the city of Lowell and the Lowell Housing Authority.

“The Climate Service Corps is an investment in both people and progress,” said MassCEC CEO Dr. Emily Reichert in a statement. “By supporting organizations that train and mentor young adults for clean energy careers, we are building a workforce that is ready to meet the state’s growing needs and ensuring that clean energy reaches communities quickly, equitably, and effectively.”

CBA has served the Acre neighborhood in Lowell for more than 40 years, starting in 1982 when a group of community members got together to push back against an urban renewal plan that would have displaced hundreds of residents. Over the years the organization has grown, and now CEO Dan Rivera said this grant funding enables them “to invest in the future of the young people in the Acre and our community at large.”

“By preparing the next generation for climate-critical careers, we’re not only opening doors to good-paying jobs, but also ensuring a healthier, more sustainable Lowell for all,” said Rivera in a statement Tuesday morning. “We are excited about launching a program at a time when the Commonwealth is making a concerted effort to invest in affordable and public housing that lowers energy for low-income families while improving comfort and air quality right here in the Acre.”

The CBA’s new Climate Service Corps will be aimed at the education and training of local young adults in “building science fundamentals and sustainable building operations,” according to Tuesday’s statement from the organization. The training curriculum will take into account the general move to all-electric systems in new homes.

The CBA’s program will feature a 20-week training experience combining educational models and job-readiness training in building science, workplace citizenship, communications and financial literacy. Upon completion, participants will “be equipped to pursue careers in fields such as Weatherization, HVAC, Building Automation Systems, Building Inspection, and Facility and Property Management,” the CBA said.

“Over the next six months, CBA will work closely with workforce development consultants and local partners to evaluate and incorporate leading educational programs into the final Climate Service Corps design,” the CBA statement concluded.

Massachusetts Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer said in the announcement statement last week that “Massachusetts is full speed ahead on creating good-paying, meaningful clean energy jobs.”

“Today, MassCEC is making our vision for a Climate Service Corps a reality. Kudos to our hardworking team at MassCEC, and I can’t wait to see the good work these young people are going to do in the world,” said Hoffer.

Other recipients of this round of grant funding for climate-based job training include the city of Boston’s Office of Workforce Development for Powercorps Boston, which is receiving $375,000 for program implementation support. Greenfield Community College, where the grant awards were announced last week, received $374,995 for the same thing. The Worcester Community Action Council will receive $50,000 in grant funding for planning support.

The CSC will focus on young people aged 18 to 24 “in environmental justice neighborhoods, low-income communities, federally recognized or state-acknowledged tribes and current and former workers of the fossil fuel industry,” MassCEC said in the announcement last week.

“The CSC provides planning grants to support local initiatives, and implementation grants to launch and enhance the programs.

Commonwealth is currently unsanctioned, but Caturus is one of a growing list of U.S. developers vying to be the fifth company to reach a final investment decision on a U.S. project this year. At peak operation, the facility could add roughly 1.2 Bcf/d in feed gas demand to the Gulf Coast market by early 2029.

36 trains: Venture Global Inc. has begun introducing nitrogen to Block 17 at its Plaquemines LNG facility after an order granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The introduction of nitrogen is usually shortly followed by a request to introduce feed gas, launching early production activities. The block of two modular liquefaction trains is the final pair of Plaquemines’ 36 trains to begin commissioning. At peak capacity, the facility could create between 2.6-3.2 Bcf/d in feed gas demand for the Gulf Coast market.

10 Mt/y: A fourth midscale train at Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion project has been undergoing startup activities, according to a filing with Texas environmental regulators. The Houston-based company told state officials flaring and other commissioning activities could last up to a year as crews bring the 0.626 Mt/y capacity train online. Once complete, all seven trains of Stage 3 would increase export capacity at Corpus Christi LNG by 10 Mt/y.

500 MMcf/d: Cedar LNG Partners LP disclosed it is planning to seek federal approval from Canadian energy regulators to upsize the capacity of its proposed LNG export project in British Columbia to 500 MMcf/d. The project partners, led by the Haisla Nation and Pembina Pipeline Corp., were originally approved to export 400 MMcf/d. The floating LNG unit currently under construction in South Korea could add around 3.8 Mt/y in export capacity to Canada’s growing BC LNG hub by 2028.

The report stated that without voluntary commitments from companies to purchase renewable power, many projects would face financing challenges, threatening the ability to meet rising US electricity demand.
The findings revealed that the renewable power projects frequently encounter substantial financial challenges in generating revenue without the backing of corporate buyers.
Renewable energy certificates (RECs) play a significant role by decreasing the number of projects facing financial difficulties by 30% and offering a stable source of additional revenue.
Since 2016, corporate buyers have emerged as a stabilising influence in the US clean energy sector, contributing to more than 40% of the new clean energy capacity additions.","Corporate buyers are playing a decisive role in advancing clean energy projects in the US, according to a new report commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA).

The report stated that without voluntary commitments from companies to purchase renewable power, many projects would face financing challenges, threatening the ability to meet rising US electricity demand.

It also underscores the importance of virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), which allow companies to lock in long-term contract with renewable energy projects to buy the future electricity generated at a predetermined price.

Securing financing for a project is contingent upon the loan provider having clarity on who will purchase the electricity and at what price.

Without such contracts in place, projects are unlikely to obtain the necessary loans for development.

CEBA US strategy senior vice-president Misti Groves stated: “It confirms that corporate buyers are critical to ensuring the US can build enough clean energy at the pace and scale that’s needed to meet skyrocketing power demand from the growth in artificial intelligence, electrification, and a resurgence in US manufacturing.”

Pine Gate Renewables executive vice-president David Groleau stated: “Corporate buyers are the backbone of clean energy deployment, anchoring project financing and shaping the future of reliable, cost-effective power.”

Pine Gate is a US-based company that develops, owns and operates utility scale solar and energy storage projects.

Completed by the renewable energy data firm REsurety, the study examined the economic performance of 251 wind and solar projects within three key power markets: the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and PJM Interconnection.

The findings revealed that the renewable power projects frequently encounter substantial financial challenges in generating revenue without the backing of corporate buyers.

VPPAs decrease the number of projects experiencing financial difficulties – by 90% in MISO and PJM, and by 80% in ERCOT.

Renewable energy certificates (RECs) play a significant role by decreasing the number of projects facing financial difficulties by 30% and offering a stable source of additional revenue.

Since 2016, corporate buyers have emerged as a stabilising influence in the US clean energy sector, contributing to more than 40% of the new clean energy capacity additions.

Solar energy company Primergy chief commercial officer Emily Cohen stated: “The acceleration of corporate purchases from clean energy projects transformed the US market over the past 10 years, providing developers and owners long-term, stable revenues on projects and a view on future demand to help maintain continued growth.

“As new markets evolve, we are excited to see more corporates buying energy across the country to bring the benefits of new energy resources.”

CEBA is a business trade organisation dedicated to mobilising a network of energy consumers and partners to implement market and policy strategies aimed at achieving a carbon emissions-free energy system.

""This agency is designed by the oil industry for its own benefit, and that should scare everyone in this state,"" Rolfes said.","Louisiana's energy and natural resources agency will be fully reorganized and have its second new name in less than two years starting Wednesday after a suite of internal and legislative changes over the past 21 months.

Officials with the new Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, formerly the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources, say the changes will place it on a more modern and transparent footing to balance ""economic growth and environmental stewardship.""

The changes are also expected, the department's secretary has said, to enhance enforcement of the state's oil and gas sector. It will also streamline permitting, a change welcomed by the industry.

""In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago. Technology, industry and environmental best practices have changed a great deal over those decades, and it’s time this agency caught up,"" Dustin Davidson, secretary of the renamed department, said in a statement earlier this month.

Often at the center of complex disputes in a state rich with energy resources, the department has a large and expanding footprint. It has a hand in regulating oil and gas, pipelines, wind and solar energy, underground injection, carbon capture and sequestration, groundwater use, and development in the coastal zone.

Department officials warned that, though the reorganization would be in effect Wednesday, the full integration from operating under the old structure to the new one could take time.

Among the changes instituted this spring and summer by the Legislature, the reorganization has also done away with a district dating from the mid-1970s that oversaw groundwater use to prevent saltwater intrusion into the Baton Rouge-area's aquifer. Groundwater regulation in Baton Rouge is now fully under the control of the newly reorganized state agency.

Oil and gas groups welcomed the broader reorganization, while one environmental group said it expected to see little difference from what they claimed is an agency that has been an industry ""rubber stamp.""

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, pointed out that the former department secretary who led the reorganization, Tyler Gray, previously led an industry trade group, the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association.

""This agency is designed by the oil industry for its own benefit, and that should scare everyone in this state,"" Rolfes said.

Tommy Faucheux, the current president of LMOGA, countered that his trade group is optimistic the changes will clear up red tape and uncertainty, a shift that is ""essential for the state to prosper.""

""It’s important that our state’s regulatory structure can challenge industry to improve while working productively to foster the economic opportunities in oil and gas that will keep our kids here in Louisiana,"" he said.

Six new offices

Faucheux and Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, also welcomed the arrival of Davidson as the new secretary. Faucheux highlighted his experience with energy policy, while Moncla cited his past work with Davidson, who was previously DENR deputy secretary and a former congressional staffer in Washington.

Gray, Landry's first appointment to the department, led the reorganization until he stepped down last month. The effort followed an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry early in his term.

The new department will go by the acronym ""C&E,"" which had been the Department of Natural Resources for decades before an earlier name change in January 2024 to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

Implemented through two regular sessions and one special legislative session, the changes did away with the historical Office of Conservation and shuffled offices within the new department while boosting their number from four to six.

The Office of Conservation was Louisiana's chief oil-and-gas regulator since the early days of the state's petroleum industry. The office's gubernatorially appointed commissioners retained independent regulatory powers through the years even after the office was folded inside DNR.

The Legislature, at department officials' urging, first removed the administrative division between the department and the office. It then did away with the conservation commissioner and vested the commissioner's powers in the secretary of the new department.

In the most recent session, Act 458, sponsored by state Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, was the primary vehicle for the reorganization. Many of its more than 225 pages removed responsibilities from the state commissioner of conservation and handed them to the new C&E secretary.

Among the six new offices, the reorganization consolidated oil, gas and coastal management permitting and compliance, the latter of which affects wetlands development, under one Office of Permitting and Compliance.

A separate division, the Office of Enforcement, will handle inspection and enforcement of permitted oil and gas wells and other activities for which the state has regulatory primacy, such as underground injection and carbon capture.

'Win over the public trust'

In a recent speech to carbon capture executives at LSU, Davidson emphasized the significance of separating permitting from enforcement.

""We saw that as something that needed to change significantly because a lot of times you had folks that were having those relationships with the applicants that then had to turn around and enforce actions against those applicants. Sometimes that can be difficult,"" Davidson said in the Sept. 5 speech.

He added that the department has a ""robust enforcement system that, I would say, in the past has not been used to our advantage the way it should have been.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/83/583c2fa4-6d53-5db8-82e8-3af813cda978/6874f639886a1.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-01 12:08:57.277842

The biennial filing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission projects average annual bill increases of about 2.1% over the next decade, less than inflation and far lower than costs forecast in the company’s prior plan.

“North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy’s low energy rates continue to support this region’s economic success,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president.

The plan calls for new natural gas units in Person, Catawba, Rowan and Richmond counties, expanded battery storage at sites including the Mayo Plant in Person County, and next-generation nuclear at Belews Creek in Stokes County. Duke is also targeting 4,000 megawatts of solar by 2034, while continuing its phased exit from coal.

Electricity demand in North Carolina and South Carolina is growing at eight times the pace of the prior 15 years, fueled by manufacturing projects that have brought more than $19 billion in investment and 25,000 new jobs to North Carolina in 2025 alone. Duke said the resource plan is meant to keep the state competitive by ensuring reliable power for industry and residents alike.

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

North Carolina projects

The plan’s footprint stretches across the state:

Person County would host two combined-cycle natural gas plants supporting heavy manufacturing growth in the Triangle and central Piedmont.

Catawba and Rowan counties are targeted for new combustion turbines to handle peak demand, adding flexible generation capacity along the I-85 corridor.

Richmond County could see another turbine, reinforcing a long-standing hub of power production in southeastern North Carolina.

Belews Creek in Stokes County remains a candidate for small modular nuclear reactors, positioning the site for one of the first next-generation nuclear projects in the Southeast. Alternatively, Duke is considering large light water reactors at its Cherokee County site in South Carolina. Proceeding at either site would represent the plan’s largest investment.

Mayo Plant in Person County is one of several sites listed for large-scale battery storage, part of a 5,600-megawatt buildout across the Carolinas.

Duke also highlighted upgrades already under way: 300 megawatts of new nuclear capacity added through efficiency uprates at existing reactors, and a 280-megawatt boost at the Bad Creek pumped storage hydro station, which supplies both Carolinas.

Growth pressures

Electricity demand across North Carolina and South Carolina is rising at a pace eight times faster than the prior 15 years. New projects announced in North Carolina this year alone have topped $19 billion in investment tied to more than 25,000 jobs, much of it in manufacturing.

That growth has already outpaced the forecast filed just two years ago. Duke says the plan is designed to keep the state competitive by ensuring reliable and affordable power for both new industry and residents.

Energy transition

While natural gas and nuclear anchor the new plan, Duke is also targeting 4,000 megawatts of solar by 2034, with sites to be determined through competitive bidding. Battery storage, meanwhile, is nearly doubling from the prior plan to meet near-term growth and take advantage of federal tax credits.

Coal plants at Belews Creek, Cliffside and Marshall could see their lives extended briefly under new federal rules, but Duke said it is maintaining a phased exit from coal.

Next steps

The plan builds on the 2023 filing approved last year and dovetails with Duke’s request to combine its two North Carolina utilities into one system. That merger, if approved, could save more than $1 billion by avoiding duplicate infrastructure.

South Carolina regulators will receive their own version of the plan later this year, followed by public hearings in both states in 2026.",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FASTFACTSDUKE.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 11:01:18.467969

READ: The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 30% Wednesday.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada's Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

If you are a Consumers Energy customer, you’ll soon be paying more for natural gas.

State utility regulators approved a 8.1% rate hike for CMS natural gas customers. The increase in monthly bills will begin in November.

The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) said the rate increase will amount to an added $6.44 on the monthly bill for a typical residential customer using 75 ccf (hundred cubic feet).

The Commission also directed CMS to present detailed evidence in its next gas rate case demonstrating the company’s efforts to offset inflation with productivity increases.

The MPSC directed CMS to file an updated 10-year gas delivery plan by the end of 2026. The plan will need to consider the costs and risks of various energy transition pathways, and to include in the plan forecasted yearly sales for each major customer class and the amount of throughput expected on a peak demand day for each year.

The commission also approved enhancements to an assistance program for low and moderate income customers, along with some infrastructure investments to improve reliability.

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy's road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

""North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy's low energy rates continue to support this region's economic success,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.""

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan's future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company's recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan's projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

""We've also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,"" Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What's next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

Nevertheless, CRE owners must bridge the gap while keeping their operating budget intact.
Energy efficiency initiatives are the bridge.
First, benchmark every facility to flag the worst energy efficiency performers.
Finally, suppose you are unable to outrun the clock on the ITC regulations and their effect on solar projects.","America’s commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios are under a two-sided squeeze. On one side, electricity demand is exploding as data centers, reshored manufacturing, and fleets of EV chargers are plugged into buildings never designed for such loads. The Department of Energy expects nationwide consumption to jump 25-30% by 2030, and many local grids are already issuing capacity warnings.

On the other side, the solar-subsidy landscape that once underwrote rooftop projects has started to shift. While the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) preserved the headline 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC), the subsequent “One Big Beautiful Bill” has accelerated timelines and restricted access depending on equipment and financing choices. Under the new rules, projects seeking the tax credits must either commence construction by July 4, 2026, or, if they do not, be placed in service by December 31, 2027, with additional “foreign entity of concern” restrictions beginning in 2026 that can disqualify projects using ineligible components. For CRE portfolios, this creates a narrow, time-bound window to lock in credits and compliant supply chains, which is why owners should move quickly to advance solar in parallel with efficiency upgrades.

Solar paradox

Despite these challenges, the long-run case for on-site solar remains strong because wholesale energy prices will keep rising with demand. Nevertheless, CRE owners must bridge the gap while keeping their operating budget intact. Energy efficiency initiatives are the bridge. LED retrofits, advanced controls, and right-sized HVAC upgrades deliver day one cash-flow-positive savings while avoiding policy uncertainty.

Each kilowatt-hour saved is a dollar back into the company that can be used for other revenue-driving operations. Efficiency also multiplies savings in other areas: by cutting peak load, it frees electrical capacity for future electrification projects, extends the life of existing equipment, and buys runtime from backup generators and batteries when the grid blinks. In this context, efficiency is not just a green initiative — it decreases costs and provides infrastructure insurance.

Subsidies & regulations

As it becomes harder to implement solar due to the ITC restrictions, companies should now be asking how efficiency can offset rising rates and where upgraded controls can enable revenue. Decision makers increasingly screen capital requests through a three-part filter:

Savings — immediate reduction in kWh and kW charges

Resilience — ability to ride through outages or demand-response events

Sustainability — contribution to emissions-reduction targets

Projects that score on at least two fronts move to the top of the queue, and efficiency nearly always clears the bar.

On the regulatory front, 10 states and more than 40 cities have adopted Building Performance Standards that set energy-use thresholds for large properties, with non-compliance penalties reaching $10 per square foot per year in Washington, D.C., and daily fines of $1,000 in Boston. Because most standards ratchet downward every five years, owners who bank early efficiency gains effectively front-load compliance and avoid paying twice: first in fines, later in rushed capital projects. Investors now view proactive upgrades as a hedge against policy risk rather than discretionary ESG spend.

In 38 states, Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) programs can fund 100% of hard and soft costs at fixed rates up to 30 years. State green banks in New York and Connecticut layer credit enhancements on top, while national energy-as-a-service providers wrap design, installation, and maintenance into a single monthly fee. In short, lack of capital is no longer a credible reason to defer upgrades.

A new path forward

From this, a practical roadmap is emerging for addressing changes to subsidies and regulations. First, benchmark every facility to flag the worst energy efficiency performers. Second, tackle “no-regrets” measures with two- to four-year paybacks such as networked lighting, VFDs on pumps and fans, demand-controlled ventilation, and occupancy-based controls. Third, bundle upgrades across multiple sites to unlock scale pricing and qualify for energy-as-a-service or operating-lease financing that keeps debt off the balance sheet. Finally, suppose you are unable to outrun the clock on the ITC regulations and their effect on solar projects. In that case, it may be worth waiting 18-24 months while monitoring the economics of upgrading or further changes to regulations.

Today’s advanced technologies are enabling smart building platforms to pull real-time data from submeters, occupancy sensors, and weather feeds, then use machine-learning models for fine-tuning setpoints minute by minute. A recent case study at 45 Broadway in Manhattan showed that AI controls cut HVAC energy use by 15.8% and saved $42,000 annually. Broader analyses suggest AI could trim building energy consumption by at least 8% across climate zones. For owners managing dispersed portfolios, cloud dashboards make it practical to benchmark, dispatch technicians, and verify savings without flying staff from site to site, closing the loop between strategy and measurable results.

Over time, portfolios will need both efficiency and distributed generation to meet decarbonization and resilience goals, efficiency to flatten the load curve, and solar plus storage to supply the remainder. Timing matters, though. Only efficiency delivers value today, making it the on-ramp to everything else.

The remainder of this decade will reward owners who move from subsidy chasing to load management. By treating efficiency as the prerequisite for resilient, low-carbon operations and by measuring success in freed-up capacity as well as kilowatt-hours saved, CRE leaders can protect profitability now while positioning their portfolios for a far more electrified and opportunity-rich future.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada's Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.",https://media.whas11.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/19a21881-ca2e-4c58-9ac3-29d5a9706b13/20251001T120004/19a21881-ca2e-4c58-9ac3-29d5a9706b13_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 10:00:44.233603

Duke submitted its biennial resource plan Wednesday morning to the North Carolina Utilities Commission. It’s a proposed roadmap of how the utility will operate in the coming years.

One of the biggest issues the utility will face is supplying energy to the growing region.

Click to resize

According to Duke, customer needs over the next 15 years will grow at eight times the rate of the previous 15 years.

To put it in perspective, South Carolina uses about 80 terawatt hours per year, according to Glen Snider the managing director of integrated resource planning.

The expected growth “is equivalent to what South Carolina consumes today,” Snider said.

And that growth isn’t just from residents.

“We’re seeing continued growth in general manufacturing,” said Kendal Bowman. Duke’s North Carolina president. “We’re seeing a lot in biosciences…We’re also still seeing significant interest in potential growth of data centers and artificial intelligence. We are definitely seeing a strong pipeline of businesses and we think it will only continue.”

The second issue is customer cost.

The plan is to lean on existing energy sources to keep customer costs down. In the proposed plan, customers may see an average 2.1% annual increase over the coming decade. That’s lower than the current inflation rate of 2.9% and about half the yearly average of previous plans, Bowman said.

To put that into dollars, Bowman said a decade from now residents would see about a $30 increase as opposed to a $54.

“We’re doing everything we can to try to keep rates as low as possible for our customers, while we’re doing our part to make sure we keep jobs and investment coming to the Carolinas,” Bowman said. “We’re trying to keep those costs as low as possible by maximizing our existing generation. We’re trying to squeeze out every megawatt we can from our existing fleet of assets.”

With the plan submitted, the state’s utility commission in the coming months will schedule several public hearings on the plan. The commission will vote on the plan by the end of 2026.

And later this year, Duke will file a similar plan with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina.

Here’s a look at some of the resources, a bit more information on data centers and the Power Bill Reduction Act:

Increase in battery storage and nuclear

Duke plans to lean in on battery storage and nuclear, especially because there are tax credits available for utilities interested in both investments.

In Duke’s previous plan, the goal was to increase battery storage by 2,900 megawatts through 2031. That’s expanded to 5,600 megawatts by 2034.

In this plan, Duke wants 1,117 megawatts of new nuclear to come online by 2037.

“We’re the nation’s largest nuclear operator in the country,” Snider said. “Nuclear provides nearly half of the energy on the grid today and as load grows, we need to grow our nuclear fleet.”

Battery storage is what it sounds like. When demand is low or when prices are lowered, the utility will store energy for high use times, such as the middle of a summer day or an early winter morning.

Natural gas

Duke would like to build two natural gas-powered generators combustion turbines in Rowan County. The additions would make up seven sites for increase natural gas creation. The utility requested permission to build the new turbines at the former Buck Steam Station site in July.

Solar, coal and wind

With the passage of the Power Bill Reduction Act, which Gov. Josh Stein vetoed and the general assembly overturned, Duke is no longer obligated to reduced its carbon emissions by 2030. However, the utility still has to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

There’s also the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which cut renewable tax credits for wind and solar energy.

Duke is no longer pursuing wind options in the immediate future, siting that the resource isn’t economically viable.

Solar is still a focus for the utility, especially with the upcoming ending of tax credits. Several solar centers are nearing construction completion.

The Power Reduction bill also gives the utility leeway to continue utilizing its existing coal plants. It will extend usage of the dual-fuel plants by two to four years, including the Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County.

In Duke’s previous plan, the goal was to convert that plant into a nuclear site. The retirement extension, Snider said, allows for a better and possibly cheaper conversion to nuclear in the future.

“We’ve been in the middle of transitioning away from coal for more than a decade,” Snider said. “We think an orderly transition out of coal still makes sense given the aging nature of our fleet. But having the flexibility to incrementally move some retirements by a couple of years really does help… We can respond to the growth we’re seeing, and it allows us to spread those retirement investments evenly over time to minimize bill impacts.”

Data centers in North and South Carolina

The plan doesn’t address data centers but Duke acknowledges that more data centers will possibly make their way to the Carolinas.

One of the major worries of residents is whether the utility will foot the bill for the additional energy usage that data centers are known to need.

Bowman said Duke puts together its rates by cost of service and with large load customers, such as data centers, its rates are different from residents.

But the utility and the commission is looking into protections for residents in regard to data centers and possible increases of energy bills.

High electricity prices hit the poorest households the hardest since they spend a larger share of their money on their power bills.
So, no — we’re not in an energy crisis, but it’s unlikely that your power bills will come down anytime soon.","Like most Americans this month, your most recent power bill may have given you a shock. Residential electricity rates have risen fast across the US — more than 30 percent on average since 2020 and almost double the rate of inflation in the past year — with no end in sight.

It’s not great for anyone’s budget, whether you’re a renter or an industrialist. High electricity prices ripple beyond consumers and throughout the whole economy, disrupting manufacturing, construction, transportation, and more.

And of course, electricity prices are a huge political issue. President Donald Trump campaigned on cutting energy prices in half, and now that they’re moving in the wrong direction, he has taken to blaming renewables, the cheapest sources of new generation, and promised $625 million to the ailing US coal industry. Power bills are becoming a hot button in local politics, too, like the New Jersey governor’s race, and you’ll likely see them featured in more political ads.

Given how fast and how high electricity prices have jumped, just how worried should we be? Is this a crisis, something that’s going to put more households in danger of getting their power shut off while driving up inflation and slowing growth? Or is this a return to normal after an era of unusually low prices?

There are several dynamics driving the current power price spike. Rising electricity demand, volatile fuel prices, inflation, tariffs, a slowdown in transmission line construction, and long delays in adding new generators to the power grid are all conspiring to create more expensive utility bills. And these variables aren’t changing direction anytime soon, so unfortunately, your bills will likely rise further.

“All of those factors are combining to create a scenario in which there could be long-lived year-over-year increases in electricity prices,” said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

High electricity prices hit the poorest households the hardest since they spend a larger share of their money on their power bills. Power shutoffs due to nonpayment were already rising at the beginning of the year. Close to 80 million Americans have to trade off between paying their electricity bills and other expenses like health care and housing, and utilities are asking their regulators to raise rates further. “To a big segment of households — lower income-, even moderate-income households — it’s already a crisis,” Quigley said.

But there is some important context you have to consider, and some of the big picture trends are actually working to help us spend less on energy and reduce our impact on the environment. How quickly this happens, though, will depend on policy decisions in the near term.

One thing to keep in mind is that electricity is just one form of energy that you use. You may also have to pay for natural gas for heating and cooking, as well as gasoline for your sedan or pickup truck. But many American homes are electrifying, trading gas furnaces for more efficient heat pumps, gas burners for induction stoves, and V8 engines for electric motors. Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit think tank, dubbed this combined basket of household electricity and fuel spending the “energy wallet,” using it as a way to track how these trends are changing over time while accounting for fuel switching.

Last month, EPRI released a report calculating that in 2024, the average annual US energy wallet spending was $5,530 per household. Gasoline was the largest slice of that pie, at $2,930 per household, while electricity was $1,850. Adjusting for inflation, overall energy spending has actually held fairly steady since 2000. And prior to 2024, electricity spending was mostly level as well. Perhaps it’s more remarkable that overall energy spending was so stable for so long.

Now, electricity prices are surging in addition to all of the uncorked demand from the Covid-19 pandemic, when the global economic slowdown and pressure from policymakers kept a lid on utility bills.

“I think if we were to repeat this analysis for next year, there would probably be a little bit of an uptick this year, but the data that I’m looking at doesn’t suggest a really significant increase in the historical context,” said Geoffrey Blanford, the lead author of EPRI’s report.

But there isn’t just one story unfolding across the country.

The US has a particularly chaotic energy system. How much people pay to light their homes, stay warm, and get around varies a lot from state to state, and even among neighbors. For example, Texas households tend to spend a larger share of their budgets on keeping their pickup trucks running, while families in Massachusetts spend a greater portion on staying warm.

So, no — we’re not in an energy crisis, but it’s unlikely that your power bills will come down anytime soon. There is some good news though: In the years ahead, Americans are actually poised to spend a smaller share of their incomes on energy overall as technology makes it more cost-effective to shift away from fossil fuels.

“In our forward-looking scenarios, one of the key drivers for change is electrification, particularly light-duty vehicles,” Blanford said. “This tends to actually reduce the energy wallet in real terms per household over time even as you’re spending more on electricity.” Though electric car sales have slowed down in the US, they are still rolling into more driveways. And as homes and appliances become more efficient, that will help reduce energy bills as well. Based on current trends, the average US household energy wallet will shrink by 36 percent by 2050, with state-level declines anywhere from 10 to 50 percent, according to the report.

Looking ahead to the upcoming winter, there are also things that policymakers can do to soften the blow of higher electricity rates for the most vulnerable families. One is to bolster initiatives like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, an initiative Trump wanted to eliminate. Another is to impose generation requirements on major new power users like data centers to run AI models so they aren’t competing with households for existing electrons on the grid. “These data centers, which are kind of ground zero of all of the angst about increasing costs, they should be, without question, required to bring their own power,” Quicgley said.

And there needs to be a major push to deploy more generation and upgrades to the power grid, particularly energy storage. Grid-scale batteries have seen breathtaking growth in the past few years, but they’re still a small segment of the energy mix. “There needs to be a huge push to foster battery deployment,” Quigley said. “The quickest way to bring on new generation is to look at solar and storage.”

We’re still facing chaos in the energy industry, and the Trump administration isn’t making things easy for utilities, power providers, and even the fossil fuel industry. But we have many of the tools we need to manage higher utility prices, if we’re willing to invest in them. For us normal people, the US Department of Energy recommends tactics like conducting a home energy audit, using energy-efficient appliances, installing double-pane windows, and sealing gaps in doors.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/GettyImages-2203483581.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C12.005100727099%2C100%2C75.989798545802&w=1200,N,,2025-10-01 10:00:36.154515

While development-stage firms have gone public before, its unusual for a company under a year old with no revenue to pursue an IPO at a $10 billion-plus valuation.

“It (Fermi’s IPO) speaks to the gold rush happening in AI infrastructure right now. It’s a cash geyser,” said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs.

Amarillo, Texas-based Fermi sold 32.5 million shares at $21 each in an upsized IPO, after marketing them between $18 and $22.

Founded in January 2025, Fermi secured a $12.5 billion valuation in the IPO, just months after issuing convertible bonds at a valuation of $3 billion.

“Demand for AI-driven infrastructure — and Fermi’s plan to pair it with its own modern power sources — has investors intrigued,” said Troy Hooper, co-head of equity capital markets, Americas, at Mergermarket. “The company’s political ties are seen as another tailwind.”

Co-founded by former Texas Governor and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Fermi has bold ambitions. The company is aiming to build the world’s largest energy and data complex, powered by nuclear, natural gas and solar.

BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME

Project Matador, Fermi’s flagship project, is expected to deliver 1.1 gigawatt of power by 2026 end and up to 11 GW at scale. A gigawatt of power is roughly half the Hoover Dam’s full generating capacity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Last month, Fermi entered a non-binding letter of intent with its first tenant for a 20-year agreement. Still, it does not expect tenant revenue to commence until 2027.

“Any investor buying Fermi will need to have a mindset of “if you build it, they will come,” Kennedy said.

Analysts said execution will be key to sustain market enthusiasm, with investors expected to closely scrutinize signed contracts and progress on its ambitious buildout.

A successful listing could pave the way for other long-duration, capital-intensive AI infrastructure bets, according to Hooper.

Still, some caution persists.

“History offers a cautionary note: many pre-revenue IPOs during the Dot-com era and the recent SPAC boom failed to live up to the hype and ended poorly,” Hooper said.

That rationale led a Delaware state court to narrow that state’s lawsuit to in-state emissions and a Baltimore court to dismiss its case outright last year.
None of this is to say that climate change is not a real and urgent problem.","On Oct. 6, the Maryland Supreme Court will hear consolidated appeals in climate lawsuits filed by Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County against numerous American energy companies. At stake is whether Maryland law can be stretched to hold American energy producers liable for the global effects of climate change.

State court judges in Baltimore and Annapolis already dismissed these cases as preempted by federal law. The question now is whether Maryland’s highest court will affirm that ruling or allow identical litigation that has failed in Maryland and across the country to continue.

Since 2017, close to three dozen states, counties and municipalities have tried to use state consumer or nuisance laws to pin the costs of climate change on energy producers. Most have lost. Courts in New Jersey, South Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania have already dismissed such claims, finding them far beyond the scope of state laws.

Climate change is a global challenge. Emissions come from billions of decisions made over more than a century, across every state and country. Courts have consistently recognized that no single jurisdiction can regulate global emissions through local tort law. As one South Carolina judge warned, these suits risk creating a “chaotic web of conflicting legal obligations.” That is why the U.S. Supreme Court in American Electric Power v. Connecticut – in a decision handed down by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – unanimously held that federal law governs these claims, and why Maryland judges have already dismissed them.

Even the Biden-Harris administration acknowledged that these cases face constitutional hurdles. In the former solicitor general’s brief, the Justice Department admitted that climate lawsuits may falter when they attempt to penalize companies for out-of-state or international conduct. The brief noted defendants “may ultimately prevail on their contention that respondents’ claims are barred by the Constitution … to the extent the claims rely on conduct occurring outside” state borders. That rationale led a Delaware state court to narrow that state’s lawsuit to in-state emissions and a Baltimore court to dismiss its case outright last year. The legal foundation for climate litigation is shaky at best.

National security leaders have also urged caution. Retired Air Force Gen. Richard Myers and retired Navy Adm. Michael Mullen warned that undermining petroleum production through litigation could harm America’s fuel security and military readiness.

None of this is to say that climate change is not a real and urgent problem. Marylanders know firsthand the risks of rising seas, stronger storms and hotter summers. But the state’s path forward lies in practical solutions, not courtroom battles with little chance of success.

Maryland has already invested in resilience projects, renewable energy and emissions-reduction initiatives that make a measurable difference. Expanding those efforts, through innovation, infrastructure and collaboration will do far more for local communities than years of costly litigation likely to end in dismissal.

It is also worth noting that the Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County cases have been brought by San Francisco-based trial lawyers. Their interests do not align with Maryland’s. For them, the lawsuits are part of a broader campaign, regardless of whether they succeed. For Maryland, however, the risk is wasted time, taxpayer dollars and missed opportunities to implement real solutions.

Climate change is a challenge of governance and policy, not ambulance-chasing tort law. Disputes of such interstate and international nature belong with Congress and federal agencies, not local courts. Allowing state-level claims to proceed risks turning judges into policymakers, imposing regulations through litigation rather than democratic debate.

Maryland’s own circuit judges recognized this, finding that the Constitution’s federal structure does not allow state law to be applied to claims tied to global emissions. Upholding those rulings would not be a denial of climate action. It would be an affirmation that the courts must respect their proper role.

If Maryland truly wants to lead on climate solutions, it should build on the work already underway: Investing in coastal resilience, supporting technological innovation and fostering partnerships with federal agencies and the private sector. These initiatives can deliver real benefits for Maryland families, workers and communities. By contrast, pursuing lawsuits that have already failed in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina — and Maryland — itself is a distraction. It will not bring the progress Marylanders need.

The Maryland Supreme Court has an opportunity to bring clarity and finality. By affirming the dismissals, it can ensure that the state’s energy and resources are directed toward viable solutions, not prolonged legal battles. Doing what’s best for Maryland means moving beyond litigation and focusing on policies that actually work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1182600677-2048x1436.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 11:01:21.554159

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy's road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

""North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy's low energy rates continue to support this region's economic success,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.""

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan's future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company's recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan's projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

""We've also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,"" Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What's next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA's job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 33% before the opening bell Wednesday.",https://www.therepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/172d264722c14d59bd553f053c5ab79d.0-preview.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 12:08:25.549325

Legislation will also be brought forward to ban the fracking of shale gas.

He added: “Fracking will not take a penny off bills or create long-term sustainable jobs. It will trash our climate commitments, and it is dangerous and deeply harmful to our natural environment.”

Renewable UK deputy chief executive Jane Cooper said: “The energy secretary is right to focus on the economic benefits that clean energy industries bring to the UK, by highlighting the fact that they offer the biggest opportunity for job creation in decades.

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy’s road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

“North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy’s low energy rates continue to support this region’s economic success,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president. “By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.”

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan’s future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company’s recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan’s projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

“We’ve also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,” Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What’s next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 33% before the opening bell Wednesday.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

The permit represents the completion of construction for the C$5bn ($3.5bn) facility, paving the way for the commencement of cell manufacturing operations within the year.

NSE CEO Danies Lee said: “This achievement is the direct result of a shared vision, effective partnership, and incredible hard work of everyone involved.

“As we transition from construction to operations, I am deeply grateful for the collaboration between our partner companies LG Energy Solution and Stellantis, our construction partner Alberici-Barton Malow, the City of Windsor, the provincial and federal governments, and all who have supported our project to be completed safely and on schedule.”

In 2022, Stellantis partnered with LGES to create the inaugural EV battery manufacturing plant in Canada.

The JV is poised to produce lithium-ion battery cells and modules to support a substantial share of Stellantis’ vehicle production needs in North America.

The construction of the 4.23 million ft² plant started in the same year.

In 2023, the parties finalised an agreement with the Canadian federal and provincial governments regarding subsidies for the Ontario-based plant.

Last year, NSE began assembly of battery modules at the plant.

With an annual production capacity of up to 49.5 gigawatt hours, the NextStar Energy facility is said to be equipped for core operations including electrode production, cell formation and assembly, and module assembly.

The company said that it has employed over 950 full-time staff and is committed to generating 2,500 local jobs.

The site now hosts 11 buildings, encompassing two main manufacturing facilities for cells and modules, alongside nine support buildings such as a recycling centre and a safety testing laboratory.

While minor construction work is still underway in areas not yet operational, the facility is “fully approved for safe occupancy and ready for production.”

Windsor mayor Drew Dilkens said: “The C$5bn investment has placed us at the forefront of electrification, and our collective commitment to collaboration, land development, infrastructure, and job creation continues to drive new investments and build the foundation of future growth and development for Windsor and Essex County.”",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/10/DJI_20250903115654_0206_D.JPG-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 09:00:19.952254

(F) CEO Jim Farley reportedly stated on Wednesday that buyers in the U.S. prefer a $30,000 electric vehicle over utility vehicles, which cost $75,000 but offer a larger battery.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Farley added that Ford does not want to live under the shadow of Tesla Inc. (TSLA), after having played the “No. 2” role to the latter for three years.

“We've learned ... people are not willing to pay [a] $30,000 premium for that big battery on a [$50,000], $60,000 utility. But they're willing to buy a $30,000 EV if they save $2,000 a year compared to gas costs,” said Farley in the interview.

Ford’s shares were down 0.05% in Wednesday’s premarket trade. Retail sentiment on Stocktwits around the company trended in the ‘bullish’ territory.

Farley added that while Ford is trying to learn its lessons from trailing behind Tesla to better augment its portfolio for what customers are demanding, the company is now benchmarking itself against Chinese giant BYD Co. (BYDDY). “[BYD has] full support from the Chinese government ... they've been at this for 20 years. Ford has to innovate, to catch up with BYD because we're a global company. We're going to compete with them around the world,” he added in the interview.

Ford’s CEO reiterated that the company’s aim is to roll out affordable EVs, pointing to the “Universal EV Platform” announced in August. Ford had announced plans to launch a midsize four-door electric pickup with a targeted starting price of about $30,000, scheduled to reach customers by 2027.

Ford stated that its “Universal EV Platform” reduces parts by 20% compared to a typical vehicle, the assembly line is 15% faster, and the cost of ownership for buyers over five years is less than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.

F stock is up 21% year-to-date and over 13% in the past 12 months.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America’s health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump’s boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it’s natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA’s furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet’s air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,” Ruckelshaus said. “Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA’s job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. “Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump’s new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,” followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America’s health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency’s shutdown plan

The EPA’s shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren’t funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won’t say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it’s 25% — but the Trump administration’s budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan’s presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency’s shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,” he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,” said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children’s health protection division.

DETROIT — ""A lot of surprises."" That's how Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley described his past five years leading the Detroit automaker, which he believes now has a solid foundation.

For Farley, who marks his fifth anniversary as CEO on Wednesday, there have been industry-wide problems to deal with, as well as Ford-specific issues that the company is still in the process of navigating.

The 63-year-old CEO has been working to make Ford more capital efficient, improve quality to reduce recall and warranty costs, and grow profit margins. That's on top of industry-wide concerns about changing regulations, including tariffs, and shifting dynamics in electric and autonomous vehicle strategies.

""I think there were certainly a lot of surprises,"" Farley told CNBC on the sidelines of a Ford event Wednesday in Detroit. ""I would say what I'm most proud of is the team I built, together with [Ford Chair Bill Ford], as well as the foundation.""

Farley said it's still going to ""take more work,"" but the company has a good base after years of restructuring to perform better than it has under his tenure thus far. He's optimistic about Ford continuing to improve the company's overall performance and grow shareholder value.

""We need to get more capital efficient. We need to have higher margins than 4% or 5%, and we we need to be more resilient to economic cycle,"" Farley said, adding some recent changes in regulations from the Trump administration may be more beneficial than Wall Street expects for Ford.

Investor 'surprise'

Despite the company's ongoing challenges, Ford stock has been a surprising return for investors that have stuck with the automaker, which remains a ""hold"" based on average ratings of Wall Street analysts compiled by FactSet.

While Ford's stock price hasn't increased as much as General Motors , Tesla or the overall S&P 500 index over the past five years, its total shareholder return — including a historically strong dividend — has made it a better investment than many of its peers.

Stock Chart IconStock chart icon

Ford's total shareholder return over the past five years is roughly 134%, according to FactSet. That tops its largest global competitors other than Tesla – at 211% – over that time period.

GM, Ford's closest rival, has a total return of about 113% over that time period — in line with the S&P 500, according to Factset. U.S.-listed shares of Toyota Motor , meanwhile, had a cumulative total return of 61%, while Honda Motor shares had a total return of 51%.

On a per share basis, Ford stock closed Tuesday at $11.96 per share, up roughly 80% since Farley became CEO on Oct. 1, 2020. That compares with Tesla, up 211% to nearly $445; GM increasing 106% to roughly $61; and the overall S&P 500 index with a 99% increase since then.

Farley has managed to woo Wall Street more than his two most recent predecessors — both of whom departed the company after double-digit losses in Ford's stock price.

Farley became the head of Ford amid more than decade lows in the company's stock price following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. He took over from CEO Jim Hackett, who was recruited by Chair Bill Ford to replace longtime executive Mark Fields.

Ford's stock under Hackett, ex-CEO of furniture maker Steelcase, declined roughly 40% during his tenure from May 2017 through September 2020. It was slightly better under Fields' roughly three-year tenure, when the stock declined around 35%.

The stock's best performance in the past 25 years occurred under CEO Alan Mulally, from September 2006 through July 2014, when shares jumped roughly 178%.

Ford's stock saw its lowest point under Farley when he took over the company in 2020. Its high during the past five years was $25.87 per share in January 2022, which occurred during the automaker's push into electric vehicles such as the F-150 Lightning and notable upgrades.

At that time, Ford's market value topped $100 billion for the first time ever. It's now less than half that around $48 billion, with the stock off 54% from that high. That compares to GM's market cap of about $58 billion.

Road ahead

To achieve further upside, the company will need to address several factors, including quality and recall issues as well as costs — areas Farley has tried to combat for years.

Ford has spent billions of dollars on warranty and recall problems in recent years, setting industry-wide records for the number of recalls in 2025.

""To justify further upside for Ford it would require a multiple re-rating, which we believe may be a challenge,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a Sept. 12 investor note, citing overhangs of structural costs, quality and recalls. ""The ongoing cycle of recalls remains a challenge, and it's unclear when this cycle might end.""

While there have been improvements, the company remains at a disadvantage to its peers when it comes to costs.

In 2023, Ford said it faced an overall cost disadvantage of between $7 billion and $8 billion, including $3 billion to $4 billion in material costs and $3 billion in structural costs, in addition to ongoing recall costs that the company considers ""special items.""

Since then, Ford has been working to trim that figure and improve its product and quality, including closing roughly $1.5 billion in its material cost gap last year. The company, executives said in July, is on track for another $1 billion reduction in costs this year, excluding tariff impacts — increasing that figure to $2.5 billion.

""GM's still better than us on cost, but we made a lot of progress this year,"" Farley said Tuesday. ""First time, without restructuring, we got a billion year-over-year cost down, which is a big deal.""

Rebecca Cook | Reuters

Amid Ford's pullback in costs, the company under Farley has altered its plans for all-electric vehicles, including taking a nearly $2 billion hit last year for delaying and canceling EVs.

Farley on Tuesday said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% in September — which is expected to be a record — to 5% this month after a federal incentive program for electric vehicles ended.

Along with its self-inflicted cost issues, Ford has been managing tariffs, electrification and a volatile regulatory landscape. There have been a slew of federal changes but some, such as the elimination of national emissions penalties, are assisting the automaker in offsetting expected tariff impacts of $3 billion this year.

""We've got to work through a couple of these policy issues that could be a big tailwind for the company,"" Farley said Tuesday, adding its commercial Pro business remains another highlight. ""I don't think the market has understood the benefit of the EPA rule change. It's going to be big for our industry, for companies like Ford.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108205855-1759251237159-gettyimages-2237912740-FORD_PRO.jpeg?v=1759251260&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-01 08:00:39.645767

Summary

Regulated utilities are some of our favorite picks for rising dividend income.

American Electric Power benefits from economic development and favorable legislation, has a BBB S&P credit rating, and can keep growing its payout.

NextEra Energy's service territory enjoys favorable demographics, the utility has an A-rated balance sheet, and can build on its track record as a Dividend Aristocrat.

H2O America can cash in on massive investment needs for U.S. water infrastructure, possesses an A- S&P credit rating, and has the fundamentals to extend its lengthy dividend growth streak.

Recurring dividend income. In the personal finance realm, this is almost as good as it gets (more on that in a moment).

That's because this is commonly used to reach financial independence (passive income > expenses).

Gov. Josh Stein has tasked a group of experts and working professionals with finding solutions that don’t break the bank.

State regulators, elected officials, researchers, private business leaders and nonprofits held the first meeting of the North Carolina Energy Task Force on Tuesday. They discussed how the state will meet rising energy demand while preserving reliability and low rates.

“There are new users in the state that are consuming energy at previously, frankly, unimaginable rates, whether it’s the large-scale manufacturing [...], or it’s the data centers,” Stein said.

Data centers, in particular, drew attention from several experts who presented during the day’s proceedings. Todd Olinsky-Paul, of the Clean Energy State Alliance, emphasized that these projects are difficult to pin down since companies may place bids in multiple states.

Speakers proposed possible solutions to rising demand, such as large load tariffs and shifting energy demand away from peak hours. A recent study from Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment found that utilities can already handle the demand growth from data centers for most of the year without adding new energy generation.

“If you’re thinking about peak shifting, energy storage is going to be a key technology,” Olinsky-Paul said.

Several members emphasized the value of improving grid efficiency. Sen. Julie Mayfield from Buncombe County said this energy challenge might provide an economic development opportunity in a state with a growing clean energy economy.

“Clean energy, renewable technologies [are going to] be the fastest way to meet the short-term load growth that we’re seeing,” Mayfield said.

Matt Abele, CEO of the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association, emphasized the importance of keeping rates low when considering new energy infrastructure. He said the group should be “thinking about how we can maintain affordability for the individuals who can least afford to manage large rate increases over the next three or four years.”

EV sales in the U.S. could drop from 10–12% to 5% market share after the $7,500 federal tax credit expires.

Q3 EV sales are forecast to hit a record 410,000 units, with many buyers purchasing ahead of the incentive cutoff.

Ford and other automakers face new stress on battery plant and EV capacity planning due to abrupt policy changes.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said he expects demand for electric vehicles in the United States to be slashed in half next month as federal tax incentives expire.

Speaking Tuesday at the company’s Ford Pro Accelerate event in Detroit, Farley said EV sales could fall from a record 10% to 12% market share this month to about 5% in October, following the end of the $7,500 federal credit under the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation removed the old EV purchase incentives but added some perks for U.S.-assembled vehicles regardless of powertrain.

While Cox Automotive has forecast third-quarter EV sales to reach 410,000 units, a 21% increase from last year and the highest quarterly total ever recorded in the U.S., analysts expect several buyers to move up their purchases before the incentives expire.

Farley noted the abrupt policy change will require automakers to adjust battery plant investments and production capacity. He emphasized that while the EV industry will remain active, the market is expected to be smaller than previously anticipated in the near term.

The Ford chief added that hybrids are proving to be an easier entry point for consumers, while expensive all-electric models, such as the F-150 Lightning, which can cost up to $90,000, and the Mustang Mach-E, remain a tougher sell. Customers view EVs as fast and efficient, but they are often seen as too costly, particularly at higher price points.

Additionally, Farley pointed to tariffs as a $2 billion headwind limiting Ford’s future investment flexibility. Despite the challenges, he maintained that the EV industry will remain “vibrant” but smaller than previously expected in the near term.

The comments come as automakers across the industry reassess electrification strategies under the new policy environment and shifting consumer demand.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Expired-EV-incentives--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 08:00:13.897947

The German luxury automaker has partnered with Norwegian producer Norsk Hydro to supply the material for its new electric CLA model, which the companies say is manufactured with 40 percent less CO2 emissions than its non-electric predecessor.

""There are, of course, extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium,"" said Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of procurement and supplier quality at Mercedes. ""But sustainability and desirable products, such as the ones we produce, simply go hand in hand.""

Norsk Hydro CEO Eivind Kallevik said partnerships like this allow producers and manufacturers to share the costs of decarbonisation rather than passing them entirely to consumers.

""The metal's price premium is not deterring buyers, even in a tougher aluminium market in recent years,"" Kallevik said. ""We are seeing a growing demand for low-carbon products.""

Hydro's Aardal smelter on Norway's coast, which supplied the aluminium for Mercedes, produces the metal with just 3 kg of CO2 emissions per kilogram of aluminium, compared to the global average of 16.7 kg.

Roughly one quarter of the alloy is made from scrap, further reducing reliance on energy-intensive primary production.

Mercedes' sustainability claims have previously drawn scrutiny. The company faced criticism for a 2022 advertising campaign touting green credentials while defending itself against a lawsuit from a German climate group over its environmental impact. A court later dismissed the case.

(Reuters) -Tesla is set to report its strongest quarter of the year on Thursday thanks to a U.S. rush to secure a $7,500 EV tax credit that expired earlier this week, but analysts expect the boost to be short-lived and European weakness to persist.

The quarterly tally will help gauge how far U.S. subsidies lifted sales, as China leans on Tesla’s expanded six-seater Model Y L launched in September while Europe slumped after the electric-vehicle maker’s aging lineup struggled to compete and CEO Elon Musk’s politics dampened buyer sentiment.

That has set the stage for weaker third-quarter global deliveries than last year and a potential drop in the December quarter.

The expiry of U.S. tax credits likely accelerated purchases that normally would have been made later in the year, rather than attracting new buyers to the brand, analysts said.

Musk had also cautioned in July that Tesla faces “a few rough quarters”, as EV subsidies disappear, before revenue from self-driving software and services accelerate late next year.

The billionaire, who has negotiated a trillion-dollar pay contract that shareholders will vote on in November, has said the future of Tesla is based on self-driving cars and robots, but at the moment, most of its revenue comes from vehicle sales.

Wall Street pegs Tesla’s third‑quarter deliveries at about 441,500 vehicles, with full-year 2025 at roughly 1.6 million, about 10% below last year, according to Visible Alpha estimates. Despite the September quarter set to be the strongest this year, it would still be about 6% lower than the 462,900 delivered in the same quarter last year.

EV makers across the board pulled out the stops with marketing in the United States ahead of the federal tax credit ended on Tuesday.

“The $7,500 credit definitely should have some effect that pulled forward demand this quarter,” said Ken Mahoney, CEO at Tesla shareholder Mahoney Asset Management. Mahoney said the credit’s expiry could leave a U.S. demand gap in the fourth quarter, while price cuts and promotions, especially in China, may keep margins under pressure.

Deutsche Bank analysts, however, expect China could soften the blow in the fourth quarter, especially considering the launch of the Model Y L in September. Musk has said the Y L is unlikely to make a U.S. entry until the end of next year.

The fourth quarter also hinges on whether Tesla will keep to its goal of rolling out a cheaper version of the Model Y before year-end.

Europe is likely to remain a sore point.

In August, Tesla sales in Europe and the UK fell 22.5% from a year ago, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, as rivals leaned into plug-in hybrids and Chinese brands gained ground.

As U.S. incentives lapse, a broader pullback by other automakers on EV output could also reduce competitive pressure.

“Since Tesla has such strong margins per vehicle, they have more room to play with the pricing dynamic if they needed to,” said Brian Mulberry, senior client portfolio manager at Tesla investor Zacks Investment Management.

U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, is the chair of SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project.","By Kathy Castor, U.S. representative

Families and business owners across America deserve the opportunity to grow and thrive. Yet, I keep hearing the same concern: Rising energy costs are squeezing budgets and forcing impossible choices. In Tampa just this summer, residents saw a $50 jump in their monthly electric bill due to rising temperatures and other extreme weather. They’re not alone. According to recent data, three in four Americans are concerned about utility bills rising this year, with most saying they feel powerless to do anything about it.

The facts back up the concerns. Across the country, families are watching their electricity bills rise and wondering how they can skimp on groceries and other necessities to scrape by. Small manufacturers are struggling to stay competitive as energy costs eat into their margins. Farmers watch as economic tools that would have allowed them to keep operations in their family are ripped out of their hands.

On top of all this, new federal policies are pulling us in the wrong direction. Just look at North Carolina, where the administration has ripped away federal funds from organizations that would have lowered household bills through low-cost solar. Earlier this month, uncertainty and misguided federal policies on clean energy led to the abrupt termination of a $1.4 billion investment to manufacture next-generation batteries in a rural community — stripping away more than 1,000 good-paying jobs. Along the East Coast, interference and cancellations of clean energy projects have cost jobs and hurt efforts to keep electricity affordable.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can build a thriving and sustainable economy that empowers working people — not high-dollar political donors. And to do so, we need only look to states and communities that are already building these solutions. While we need to think big, we also have the tools we need to build a better future right in front of us.

That’s why I’m proud that we are coming together to launch SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project, a comprehensive initiative to develop real solutions for the economic challenges facing American families and businesses due to rising energy costs, increasing global economic competition and growing climate disasters. I am proud of this project because it is focused on listening to the people who are already finding ways to thrive, whether with clean energy solutions, creative farming practices or building more resilient neighborhoods. It’s our goal to help them scale their successes.

Right here in the Sunshine State, I see proof that clean energy is key to our next economic boom. Clean investments made possible by expiring federal tax credits have attracted more than $12 billion in investment, leading to more than 12,000 new jobs. Despite headwinds, over 90% of capacity added to our nation’s grid in the past year has been clean energy that can help families save money, create jobs and meet growing demand. This is proof that when we invest in clean, reliable energy infrastructure, we create economic opportunity.

The Thriving Economy Project will focus on four key areas where we can make real progress: helping communities and rural economies flourish, securing America’s affordable energy future, developing innovative financing solutions and building government systems that actually deliver results for the American people. This isn’t about imposing solutions from the top down. It’s about finding what’s already working in communities across America — and finding ways to scale it.

As someone who has spent her career working to solve problems — from my early days as an environmental lawyer in Florida, to my work as chair of the U.S. House Committee on the Climate Crisis — I know that the best policies come from the ground up, not the top down. That’s why this project will spend the next year listening to communities nationwide to see what’s working and what’s not.

We’ll bring together farmers and manufacturers, small business owners and labor leaders, mayors and governors, CEOs and policy experts, researchers and community activists. We’ll look at successful models from red states and blue states, rural areas and urban centers, because good ideas don’t have a party label. The goal is to develop a practical roadmap that Congress, states and local communities can use to create more jobs, lower energy costs, foster American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, and build stronger, more resilient local economies.

This project is about building an economy where a small business owner in Tampa doesn’t have to choose between paying her electric bill and giving her employees a raise, where a manufacturing worker in Michigan can be confident that his job will still exist in 10 years, where a farmer in Iowa can invest in new technology knowing it will pay off for his operations and his community.

American communities already are writing the playbook for 21st-century prosperity. With the Thriving Economy Project, our job is to make sure everyone has access to those tools and opportunities. The communities leading this charge have shown us what’s possible. Now it’s time to make it inevitable.

Jane Gaston, Net Zero North West CEO said: ‘We are delighted to see the launch of the North West Clean Power Report.
“Here in the North West, we are leaders in the UK’s clean energy transition.","The North West Clean Power Report sets out how the transition to clean energy will create a transformative opportunity for the region’s seven million residents. It predicts a rapid expansion in the clean energy workforce, with 35,000 new roles by 2028, and also forecasts billions of pounds of investment flowing into the region in the next few years as a result of national energy policy.

This investment is expected to position the North West as a global leader in clean energy innovation and industrial decarbonisation, attracting new businesses and developments to supercharge the region’s economic growth.

The report anticipates Great British Energy’s forthcoming Local Power Plan and an expanded role for local government and communities to own and operate local power schemes, unlocking new opportunities for community wealth building and energy resilience. It recommends that local government can enable 1 GW of locally-owned renewables by 2030 – enough energy to power around 750,000 homes.

The report goes on to say that, by working together to realise this opportunity, the North West can deliver economic security, increased business growth, and enhanced health outcomes for everyone in the region.

The Liverpool City Region is already demonstrating national leadership in clean energy and retrofit delivery. Key highlights identified in the Clean Power report include:

The Mersey Tidal Power Scheme – the UK’s most advanced tidal range project, now in the formal planning process, promising jobs, growth, clean energy and flood protection for 120 years, .

Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is leading a subregional consortium to deliver a public building investment programme, combining £35.8 million of national grant funding for heat decarbonisation, matched with local funds and loans, alongside a multi-million-pound rooftop solar programme

Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has earmarked £119 million to invest in new electric buses, depots and infrastructure upgrades as it rolls out bus franchising

Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said:

“For generations, our region has helped power the UK – and today we’re leading the charge again, this time in the race to net zero. The North West Clean Power Report shows just how big the opportunity is for our people: tens of thousands of well-paid jobs, billions in investment, and cheaper, cleaner energy for our communities.

“We’re already proving what’s possible with ambitious projects like Mersey Tidal Power, but this is only the start. By working together as one North West, we can put our region at the heart of the UK’s clean energy future – creating a fairer, greener, and more prosperous place to live and work for generations to come.”

Juergen Maier, Chair of Great British Energy said:

“The move to renewable power in the UK represents the biggest economic opportunity in a generation. This report highlights the significance of what is underway right now. Regions like the North West are seizing this opportunity and demonstrating the very real benefits. Great British Energy fully supports this report in helping multiple regions to create new jobs, stimulate British innovation and manufacturing, and above all deliver secure, cheap, renewable energy for millions of homes and businesses.”

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors representing more than 4.5 trillion euros ($5.3 trillion) of assets have urged the EU not to water-down its methane emissions law amid concerns the rules may be weakened to ease U.S. LNG imports, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Money managers including Ninety One, Pictet Group, Railpen and Royal London Asset Management urged the EU to stay the course on rules requiring importers of oil and gas to monitor and report the methane emissions of their suppliers.

Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and scientists say it is responsible for about one-third of the warming experienced to date since pre-industrial times.

Investors are concerned the European Union’s methane rules will be brought into the scope of the bloc’s simplification agenda after U.S. energy secretary Chris Wright said recently the current legislation would prevent the United States from exporting liquefied natural gas to Europe.

“The goals are admirable, and we all want to reduce methane emissions, and we will reduce methane emissions. But having laws that will prevent American gas coming here would be completely unproductive from a social cost and environmental perspective. So yes, those laws absolutely need to be fixed,” Wright said in September.

The first phase of the EU methane law is in force and does not appear to have affected U.S. gas exports to Europe – with importers of gas into Europe having to report details of their suppliers’ efforts to reduce methane emissions from May 2025.

A European Commission spokesperson said it was confident EU methane regulation would not pose any barriers to trade.

The EU has pledged to hike its purchases of U.S. energy – including LNG, as well as oil and nuclear fuel – to $250 billion per year, as part of a trade deal struck earlier this year.

The investor group warned that reopening the regulation would introduce unpredictability and undermine companies and investors working towards complying with the rules, as well as slow down efforts to reduce the volume of highly damaging methane gas released into the atmosphere.

“Watering down regulation that companies have already based investment decisions on is counterproductive and risks undermining globally agreed methane reduction efforts,” said Eric Pederson, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.

Europe has massively increased its imports of U.S. LNG, as it seeks to replace Russian energy after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The U.S. supplied 57% of the EU’s LNG, or 49.2 billion cubic metres, in January-August this year, Commission data show. The U.S. supplied 28% of the EU’s LNG – or 18.9 bcm – in 2021, the year before Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine.

Industries say they are more concerned by a tougher phase of the EU methane law, which will apply from 2027.

Starting Wednesday, U.S. consumers can no longer use a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government to help buy an electric vehicle. The Biden-era incentive is now gone — swept away in the Trump administration’s purge of climate and clean energy programs.

While it lasted, the tax credit juiced domestic EV sales. Before the incentive took effect at the end of 2022, EVs accounted for 6 percent of new U.S. car sales. Now the figure is closer to 10 percent, aided in part by a last-minute rush of buyers trying to take advantage of the funding before it disappeared.

Analysts expect EV sales to decline dramatically in October now that the tax credit and other pro-EV policies are gone. How far sales drop — both this month and in the years ahead — will speak volumes about whether former President Joe Biden did enough to prime the U.S. electric vehicle industry to stand on its own.

“We are going to get, in this Trump administration, a test of whether this technology — EVs and the infrastructure to go with it — really has a momentum of its own,” said Barry Rabe, a professor of environmental policy at the University of Michigan.

The tax credit had been around in one form or another for more than a decade when Biden took office. Congress extended it to $7,500 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, and also restricted it to U.S.-made vehicles assembled from U.S.-made batteries.

But it was only one piece of Biden’s broader push to grow America’s EV industry.

The Inflation Reduction Act also created tax credits for leasing EVs and buying used models. Those tax credits essentially became a discount on each vehicle’s sticker price, since the customers and dealers could apply them at the point of sale.

Other tax credits, loans and direct financial support funneled billions of dollars to help carmakers build mines and factories for the new industry.

Separately, Biden set a goal of building 500,000 EV chargers nationwide. To aid that effort, Congress established a $5 billion federal program to create a national network of high-speed EV chargers.

EPA and the Transportation Department also passed strict regulations on tailpipe pollution during the Biden years that were intended to push carmakers to build EVs. And the administration supported even stricter rules in California and other states that would have phased out most gas-powered cars by the mid-2030s.

It was an across-the-board strategy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and give America’s EV industry a chance to compete internationally.

Yet despite the efforts, many analysts say the country never got to see the law’s full impact.

Many aspects of the law took months or longer to put into place, and the overarching goal of Biden’s EV efforts — to get more U.S. drivers into electric cars — requires more than one presidential term to execute, as carmakers need years to design new cars, build new factories and convince consumers to buy EVs, observers said.

“You saw a lot of manufacturers announce that they were building EV facilities and battery manufacturing sites in the US., and those only really started to get finalized over the last year,” said Corey Cantor, research director at the Zero Emissions Transportation Association.

Consumers concerned with price, ‘range anxiety’

After Biden signed the IRA in 2022, it took the Treasury Department eight months to publish its first list of vehicles that qualified for the program. And the law’s rules on Chinese-made batteries and materials were so complicated that the list continued to change every few months.

The law also prompted furious pushback from Republicans, backed by the oil industry and then-candidate Donald Trump. A year after the IRA took effect, Ford CEO Jim Farley lamented the “politicization” of EVs.

Electric vehicles “have become a political football and that’s a shame,” he said in 2023.

The opposition took a toll — both politically and with car buyers.

Working with a Republican-led Congress this year, President Donald Trump was able to disassemble most of what he called the “EV mandate” in a matter of months.

And among consumers, the number of drivers considering an electric car or truck dropped to 16 percent this year, down from 25 percent in 2022, according to AAA. Drivers remained concerned about the high up-front cost of the new vehicles as well as the lack of available chargers, the poll showed.

Biden spoke to the “range anxiety” of prospective EV drivers by vowing during the 2020 presidential campaign to build a half-million new charging stations by the end of 2030. He reiterated that goal while in office.

But his administration only got partway to that mark. As of this week, about 228,000 charging ports have been installed at 76,000 locations in the United States — most of them by the private sector, according to the Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, the $5 billion federal program to help with the problem has done little. Though it continues to operate under the Trump administration, it’s helped states open only about 90 charging sites with 402 individual ports.

At the same time, carmakers have yet to solve one of the industry’s biggest challenges — the yawning gap between the sticker price of EVs and conventional cars.

In July, the average cost of an EV was $57,245 while the average cost of an internal-combustion vehicles was $48,179, according to Cox Automotive. The gap is smaller than it was in 2021, but that’s still a significant $9,000 difference.

Some of the price difference is unavoidable, given the cost of batteries. But auto companies also focused on building luxury-model EVs to boost their bottom lines, analysts said.

EV advocates have argued that the cars are cheaper over the long run because of their lower fuel and maintenance cost.

But “the sticker price is still higher,” Cantor said. “So unless you can explain that nuance up front, people may not necessarily … understand why it might make more economic sense in the long run to get an EV.”

One bright spot for the EV market has been an increase in the choices available.

There’s now a wide variety of EV and hybrid models for U.S. consumers to choose from — a trend driven by a mix of market forces, Biden administration policies and the rightward shift of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which has turned off many prospective Tesla buyers.

At the end of 2022, Tesla sold 58 percent of the EVs in the United States; that number fell to 46 percent in the middle of 2025.

Hybrid sales have grown even faster than fully electric vehicles, making up 13 percent of new-vehicle sales as of mid-year.

While they still burn gasoline, hybrids are far more fuel-efficient than conventional cars and trucks. Experts have said they could help reduce pollution in the interim as the industry continues to electrify.

There are now more than 100 electric and plug-in hybrid models on the market, and many of them sell for $29,000 to $35,000, putting them closer to matching the price of gas-powered cars.

The cost of batteries is dropping too, as carmakers started building them in bulk and researchers are finding new ways to pack more energy into smaller, lighter batteries.

Those trends will help drive electric vehicle sales even after the government support ends, said Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association. And despite all the negative publicity about EVs, drivers tend to like them once they try them, and they’re attracted by the lower cost of fuel and maintenance.

“People saying words is not the same as people getting in the car and saying, ‘This works,’ ” she said.

America vs. the world

Whether the industry can maintain momentum is unclear.

Since the IRA was enacted, carmakers have invested $67.5 billion in battery plants and $14.2 billion in EV factories, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

But the end of the tax credits will put a damper on that industrial growth. The nonprofit group Energy Innovation estimates EVs will make up about 30 percent of car sales by 2030 — instead of 40 percent.

Other forecasts are even lower.

If slower growth comes to pass, as much as 100 percent of the planned expansion of assembly plants would become unnecessary, along with half of the existing plants, according to research from Princeton University. And between 29 percent and 72 percent of battery factories would be in the same predicament.

Already, some U.S. carmakers have announced plans to ramp up production of gas-powered cars and trucks, which are more profitable, and slow down their shift to electric vehicles.

Carmakers still expect the transition will happen, but they say they can’t build electric vehicles faster than consumers will buy them.

Farley, the Ford CEO, said he expects the reversal of federal EV policy will cut in half sales of electric vehicles, Bloomberg reported.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5 percent,” he said Tuesday in a speech in Detroit. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

With fewer EVs on the road, American drivers will be stuck driving gasoline-powered cars for longer, which will lead to more air pollution and could also lead to higher prices for drivers, said Shannon Baker-Branstetter at the Center for American Progress.

Gasoline prices have been relatively low, but “if gas goes up again, it’ll leave U.S. consumers in a tight spot,” Baker-Branstetter said.

The tide could turn eventually.

California and other states likely will look for other ways to cut air pollution and promote electric transportation — although they may not be able to do it until Trump leaves office, said Robbie Orvis, an analyst Energy Innovation.

And American car companies are watching closely as the rest of the world goes electric. EVs are projected to make up a fourth of car sales worldwide in 2025, according to the International Energy Agency, and Chinese makers now dominate the industry.

American automakers find themselves in a bind. They want to sell cars in China, Europe and other regions that are rapidly converting to electric vehicles, but their home market is tepid. They’ll need to figure out how to make Americans fall for EVs without a government sweetener.

“They can’t really take their foot off the pedal when it comes to building out new models,” Orvis said, “because they will increasingly be pushed out of the international market.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/f6/34/8ec9b34b4a49be5c5b26bbafd721/ap-poll-electric-vehicles-53524.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 07:00:54.775485

The report published in September from E2 — which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization advocating for “smart policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment” — analyzed federal data from 2024 finding that clean energy jobs across the country grew by 2.8%, outpacing the growth of the U.S. economy and adding nearly 100,000 jobs.

The annual report found Kentucky’s clean energy jobs grew by 2.4% in 2024, a significantly slower pace than recent years when Kentucky was among the fastest in growth in clean energy jobs. The pace of clean energy job growth nationally was the slowest since 2020, the report said.

E2’s definition of clean energy jobs is broad, including employment connected to renewable energy generation, electricity storage and transmission upgrades, electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades.

E2 stated that policy moves by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress this year are not reflected in federal employment data from 2024, but that the moves threaten “future growth and, increasingly, the health of the U.S. economy at-large.”

The E2 report found Kentucky was among the top 10 states last year for growth in jobs connected to renewable energy generation, energy storage and modernizing the electricity grid.

Renewable energy generation jobs in Kentucky grew by 6.1% with more than 2,200 of the state’s jobs in that category coming from solar energy. Jobs related to energy storage including utility-scale batteries and modernizing the electric grid in Kentucky grew by 11.1%.

Congress accelerated the phase down of tax credits benefiting clean energy production and electric vehicles through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July, despite warnings from the renewable energy industry that hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost nationwide.

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year, Republican Kentucky U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie said as the OBBBA was moving through Congress the legislation would end spending on “Green New Deal-style waste” and “reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”

The federal $7,500 tax credit encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles ended at the end of September due to the passage of the OBBBA.

The need for urgent and meaningful action grows every day and we know the path to a cleaner, more sustainable, more affordable energy future begins with one thing – people.

The foundation of the energy transition

The knowledge and capabilities that empower people to create and sustain the clean energy transformation are at the very heart of the energy transition. But why do we, as one of the UK’s leading providers of energy and sustainable solutions for homes, businesses and entire communities, care so deeply about nurturing these green skills?

The UK’s ambitious goal to become a clean energy superpower isn’t just about reaching zero emissions – it’s about creating purposeful jobs that revitalise communities nationwide. Clean energy already supports around 450,000 jobs across Britain with hundreds of thousands more projected by 2030. And as the sector grows, so does the urgent need for a skilled and adaptable green workforce.

Pride, purpose and progress

We recently asked more than 2,000 UK school leavers aged 16 to 18 about their future aspirations1.

One in three (34%) young people told us they’re choosing to forgo the traditional university path, opting instead for apprenticeships or direct entry into the workforce. And nearly half (47%) of these respondents are considering alternative routes specifically because they want to work in a green job today, not tomorrow.

Our research reveals something profound: for many young people, pride and purpose eclipse even earning potential when it comes to choosing a career. The number one reason school leavers are drawn to green jobs is the desire to be proud of their work (44%), closely followed by wanting to help the environment (39%). A significant number (16%) would even accept a lower salary if it meant working in a role that supports the planet.

Another major driver for young people choosing apprenticeships over university is the desire to avoid student debt with almost two-thirds (64%) of our respondents citing this as a key motivator. A similar proportion (67%) believe they’ll pick up workplace skills faster through apprenticeships or jobs than through a university degree.

For us, these stats are a clear signal that the education-to-employment pipeline is evolving, and green careers are at the forefront of that change.

Investing in talent and unlocking opportunity

Investing in green skills is not just good business – it’s a matter of social responsibility. We’re incredibly proud to be recognised by The Sunday Times as the ‘Best Place to Work for Young People’ and to be one of the UK’s leading apprenticeship employers.

Through our partnerships with schools, colleges and local governments, such as our initiatives with Coventry City Council and Dudley College’s Net Zero Solutions Hub, we’re helping communities reduce their carbon footprints, learn new skills and unlock opportunities for generations to come.

In addition, our Net Zero Training Academy educates 800 people every year, and since 2018, we’ve welcomed over 1,000 apprentices across 100 training programmes, from smart meter installation to heat pump engineering.

We view green jobs in the widest possible context – we’d even go so far as to say that every job at E.ON is a green job. That’s why our commitment to green skills extends beyond technical roles, encompassing degree apprenticeships in finance, project management, quantity surveying and digital marketing. We’re building a diverse talent pipeline to ensure that everyone, from data scientists to supply chain experts, can play their part in the energy transition.

And we’re supporting other organisations in the drive for green skills too. Through levy gifting, we’ve invested close to £1.2 million over the last four years to support the creation of roles within small and medium-sized enterprises across the country, helping to remove barriers and address skills gaps.

This is just the beginning. Our ambition is to see that green skills are accessible and attainable for all, irrespective of background.

Green skills build a better Britain

The journey to a new energy world is about more than technology. It’s about people who are willing to learn, adapt, and lead. We’re not just watching this transformation unfold; we’re actively shaping it and proving that skilled, motivated individuals are the engine of progress.

The energy transition can, and must, work for everyone. By nurturing green skills, we create fair, rewarding jobs, help families and communities thrive, and drive meaningful action on climate.

As Britain builds a greener future, E.ON stands ready to empower the next generation.

Notably, that recent sale by Independent Director David Hardie was not the only time they sold Hallador Energy shares this year. They previously made an even bigger sale of -US$579k worth of shares at a price of US$19.05 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$19.57. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 18% of David Hardie's holding.

Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 39.00k shares worth US$532k. On the other hand they divested 79.95k shares, for US$1.5m.

Kentucky ranked 28th in the country for clean energy employment with more than 40,000 jobs; it ranked 11th for “clean vehicle” jobs with more than 9,000.

The report published in September from E2 — which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization advocating for “smart policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment” — analyzed federal data from 2024 finding that clean energy jobs across the country grew by 2.8%, outpacing the growth of the U.S. economy and adding nearly 100,000 jobs.

The annual report found Kentucky’s clean energy jobs grew by 2.4% in 2024, a significantly slower pace than recent years when Kentucky was among the fastest in growth in clean energy jobs. The pace of clean energy job growth nationally was the slowest since 2020, the report said.

E2’s definition of clean energy jobs is broad, including employment connected to renewable energy generation, electricity storage and transmission upgrades, electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades.

E2 stated that policy moves by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress this year are not reflected in federal employment data from 2024, but that the moves threaten “future growth and, increasingly, the health of the U.S. economy at-large.”

The E2 report found Kentucky was among the top 10 states last year for growth in jobs connected to renewable energy generation, energy storage and modernizing the electricity grid.

Renewable energy generation jobs in Kentucky grew by 6.1% with more than 2,200 of the state’s jobs in that category coming from solar energy. Jobs related to energy storage including utility-scale batteries and modernizing the electric grid in Kentucky grew by 11.1%.

Congress accelerated the phase down of tax credits benefiting clean energy production and electric vehicles through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July, despite warnings from the renewable energy industry that hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost nationwide.

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year, Republican Kentucky U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie said as the OBBBA was moving through Congress the legislation would end spending on “Green New Deal-style waste” and “reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”

The federal $7,500 tax credit encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles ended at the end of September due to the passage of the OBBBA.

The same day that Pennsylvania received the news about its funding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cuts on X.
“That means that that funding is official,” said Elowyn Corby, Mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy group.
But, even if Pennsylvania were to succeed and retain its solar funding, the state Legislature remains a stumbling block.","This story was originally published by Capital & Main.

It was a Thursday when Pennsylvania energy regulators received a pair of letters. The first let them know that $156 million in solar grant money they’d received in 2024 had been revoked; the second ordered them to stop any work related to that money.

The Aug. 7 correspondence was sent to the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, an independent financing authority for clean energy projects in the Keystone State. The agency was far from alone.

The Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority was one of 60 recipients, including state agencies, nonprofits and Native American tribes, to receive termination letters from the Environmental Protection Agency alerting them that funds they’d received under Solar for All, a Joe Biden-era initiative to help low-income households access solar energy, would be rescinded. The recipients’ accounts containing the funds won in 2024 were frozen and the money removed, environmental advocates say. Most large fossil fuel-producing states, including California, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, had their funds pulled.

The same day that Pennsylvania received the news about its funding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cuts on X. “What a grift,” he said of the $7 billion program established under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s signature legislation. .

But advocates and many Democrats say that Zeldin and the EPA are acting illegally. The Solar for All program, and the $27 billion funding bucket that underlies it, called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, was “Trump-proofed”before President Joe Biden left office, a move designed to ensure that an incoming Republican administration couldn’t legally claw back that money. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was established with the requirement that the money be “obligated” by Sept. 30, 2024 — before the end of Biden’s term — after which point it could not be revoked.

“That means that that funding is official,” said Elowyn Corby, Mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy group. “It is real. It has gone to the states. Many of the grantees are already pulling down funds.”

Now, congressional Democrats are waging a war against the Trump administration to defend that stance, one supported by numerous environmental groups and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which sent a letter to the EPA on Aug. 28 asserting that the federal agency “does not have the authority to unilaterally terminate the [award] agreement.”

Zeldin defended the EPA’s right to withdraw the Solar for All funds by invoking language in HR 1, President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was adopted July 4. That bill stipulates that the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will be “repealed” and “the unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out” the program “rescinded.”

Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, Democrats from Virginia, urged Zeldin to walk back the move. On Aug. 14, the two senators joined Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and 29 other colleagues, in arguing that freezing or pulling back the money is illegal, and that the line in the “Big Beautiful Bill” is predicated on a falsehood.

“It is not legally possible to claw back funding that has already been obligated,” Whitehouse and his colleagues wrote.

After Solar for All funds were rescinded, Vote Solar organizers launched a letter-writing campaign to 21 state attorneys general urging them to “take swift action” against the EPA to protect the money. “EPA’s attempt to terminate Pennsylvania’s Solar for All program is misguided and unjustified,” says a letter the group, along with 30 other clean energy and conservation groups, sent to Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday.

Olivia Nedd, senior policy director of the group’s access and equity program, said their call was met with promising responses by Colorado and California, both which have substantial investments in solar and other renewable sources of energy. But, she said, she’s not heard back from Sunday, a Republican, or his office.

It’s unclear how far, for his part, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will go to defend the Solar for All funds. But environmental advocates in the state told Capital & Main that the letter it sent to the federal government on Aug. 28 is a required first step to litigation.

“It does not reflect a commitment on the Shapiro administration’s part to pursue a legal challenge,” said Robert Routh, Pennsylvania policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “But it is a necessary step procedurally in order to allow them to be able to do that in the future.”

A spokesperson for Shapiro did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment. Shapiro sued the Trump administration in February after a Jan. 20 executive orderfroze all Inflation Reduction Act funds, including Solar for All. The funds were later unfrozen, but then thrown into limbo with Zeldin’s announcement. Whether Shapiro will again take action to wrestle back the money is an open question.

But, even if Pennsylvania were to succeed and retain its solar funding, the state Legislature remains a stumbling block. Embroiled in a bitter impasse, the state’s budget has yet to reach Shapiro’s desk nearly three months after the June 30 annual deadline. Though rescinded for now by the EPA, Pennsylvania’s award of Solar for All funds, like many public programs in the state, including Medicaid and education, are also caught in the crossfire of the budget debate.

Three months after Pennsylvania was awarded its Solar for All grant funding, a line was inserted into an omnibus fiscal code bill requiring that the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, the agency responsible for doling out the dollars, secure approval from the state Legislature in order to spend the funds.

Pennsylvania’s Solar for All funds were earmarked for low-income residents and those who live in environmental justice communities — ones that are disproportionately exposed to pollution. The program promised to provide solar installations to 12,500 households that were guaranteed at least 20% savings on their electricity bills. It promised to thwart climate change-inducing fossil fuel emissions, create green jobs and help build out the state’s solar economy, which is a fraction of that of other fossil fuel-producing states. Pennsylvania currently ranks 49th in the nation for its growth in solar, wind and geothermal generation over the last decade, according to the nonprofit advocacy group PennEnvironment.

“This is taxpayer money that’s out there. It was competitive. It was given to pretty much all the states. We got a share, and we’re turning our back on it,” said Jen Quinn, legislative and political director at the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club. “It’s just deeply confusing.”

State Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, a progressive Democrat from Philadelphia, introduced a bill in January attempting to secure that legislative approval. But, after advancing out of committee, it was quickly halted by an amendment that critics said amounted to a poison pill, forcing Fiedler to look for other ways to free up the grant money.

“Solar and wind are the cheapest and quickest to build and can offer households savings,” Fiedler told Capital & Main in a statement. “It’s ridiculous to block these new projects at a time when Pennsylvanians are struggling more and more to keep up with rising electricity bills.”

As negotiations over the state budget creep on, it is unclear whether language that would release the state’s allocation of Solar for All funding will make it into a final deal, regardless of whether it is restored by the Trump administration. In June, the Democratic-controlled state House passed a bill that included a line doing just that, but when it reached the Republican-controlled Senate, the line was abruptly removed from the legislation.

“Negotiations are ongoing,” said Elizabeth Rementer, press secretary for House Democratic Majority Leader Matt Bradford, of Montgomery County, in a statement on the status of the Solar for All funding. “Despite the fact that Solar for All remains an important priority for House Democrats, it’s clear Senate Republicans are unwilling to release these funds to help cut utility costs for Pennsylvanians and grow the economy.”

This battle mirrors the one playing out at the federal level — both stemming from arcane language tucked into the pages of mega-bills, both viciously partisan and both with no clear end in sight. Those who are hurt the most by it, advocates say, are low-income homeowners faced with rising energy costs.

“It is hard to find a clear rationale for the politicization of these funds,” said Corby, the Vote Solar regional director. “Especially in a world where legislators on either side of the aisle are hearing from their constituents practically every day about how hard it is to keep up with rising energy costs.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1747382682-2048x1409.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 09:00:56.451161

As President Trump has continuously threatened to deploy troops to Chicago, Durbin requested a hearing to examine the harms of military deployment to cities. While today’s hearing was politically reframed to blame “blue cities” for Republican refusals to support effective solutions to gun violence and to glamourize the Trump Administration’s illegal and unconstitutional deployment of the military to American cities, Durbin underscored that the President continues to engage in political theater rather than prioritize serious policymaking that would address violent crime.

In his opening statement, Durbin discredited the Trump Administration’s narrative that violent crime is rampant in blue cities. Durbin emphasized that, as crime rates have dropped in cities like Chicago, Republican-led cities like Shreveport, Louisiana, see a higher violent crime rate than Washington, D.C.

After delivering his opening remarks, Durbin introduced the two minority witness – Gregory Jackson, Jr., and Major General William L. Enyart. Mr. Jackson is the President of the Rocket Foundation, an organization founded in 2022 that centers on ending the gun violence epidemic. A gun violence survivor himself, Mr. Jackson previously served as Deputy Director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention under the Biden Administration.

Major General William L. Enyart is a retired member of the U.S. Air Force and Army National Guard. His nearly 36-year military career included active-duty service in the Air Force and nearly 30 years in the Army National Guard. His service culminated as Adjutant General of the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012. He previously served as a Brigadier General and Deputy Commanding General of the Illinois Army National Guard.

So, we should be working together on a bipartisan basis, which we have done over and over again in this Committee, to continue reducing crime and making our communities safer for all Americans.”

“Let’s look at the reality. For the last two decades, the murder rate in my home state of Illinois has been lower than the murder rates in Missouri, Louisiana, and Alabama—all states represented by Republicans on this Committee.”

“In 2023, Illinois spent $516 per capita on policing – more than the states of Iowa, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Missouri, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Alabama.”

“In Chicago, over the first six months of the year, homicide rates are down 32 percent, [and] shootings have dropped 37 percent. We need to build on this success, not ignore it.”

“During my time as Chair, I held more than a dozen hearings on reducing violent crime. We focused on legislation, not lamentation. I reported numerous bills supporting law enforcement that were signed into law by President Biden, including the Protecting America’s First Responders Act and the Recruit and Retain Act. And we passed the historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to crack down on gun violence.”

“Instead of political theater and partisan attacks, we should focus on proven efforts like the Heal Initiative, a project I launched in 2018 with ten of Chicago’s largest hospitals to address the root causes of violence in 18 Chicago’s neighborhoods with the highest rates of violence, poverty, and health disparities.”

“Unfortunately, President Trump has done everything he can to undermine efforts like this. He cut $169 million from community safety funding authorized by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. He cut $72 million in funding for state and local law enforcement. The 2026 Trump Budget would slash the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program – better known as HIDTA – by more than a third, from about $300 million to $196 million.”

“While President Trump claims to be tough on crime, he granted full and unconditional pardons to nearly 1,600 January 6 rioters, including more than 600 charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.”

“Here’s the reality. President Trump isn’t interested in reducing crime. He is interested in political posturing. 100 troops into the city of Chicago. Did you hear the announcement this morning by the Secretary of Defense? One of the characteristics he insists on when it comes to building a strong military is that it be apolitical. His word – apolitical.”

“The President has deployed thousands of American troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and made disturbing threats to wage war against Chicago, Portland, and other American cities.”

“Let’s be clear: these are illegal, unconstitutional, and un-American power grabs by the President that actually endanger Americans. President Trump is looking for any excuse to send soldiers into American communities so he can play the role of strongman on TV.”

“In Illinois, his misguided mass deportation [scheme] is targeting communities, but it’s not making them safer. Remember the litany that we heard, over and over again, about immigrants to this country? [The President claimed immigrants are] rapists, murderers, terrorists, the criminally insane. Did you know that 70 percent of the immigrants detained so far by the President have no criminal convictions?”

“The Administration’s main focus seems to be photo ops for social media, like these pictures from downtown Chicago of armed masked men, which just happen to feature the Trump Tower in the background. Just yesterday, we learned the Department of Homeland Security requested the deployment of 100 military personnel to Illinois over the objections of the governor. Simply put, despite what the Secretary of Defense said at Quantico this morning, the President’s use of the military to police American streets is political theater staged for his MAGA supporters, not effective law enforcement aimed at making communities safer.”

“Meanwhile, thousands of FBI, DEA, and ATF agents, as well as thousands of service members across this country, have been diverted from critical missions to carry out the President’s immigration agenda. Not surprisingly, federal drug prosecutions this year have dropped to the lowest [level] in decades.”

“We need to support law enforcement and policies that improve—not erode—trust between them and our communities.”

“As Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will not sit idly by while this President tramples the Constitution. And I will use every tool at my disposal to reduce crime and protect our communities—in a lawful way that promotes lasting change.”

Shutdown Leaves Energy Markets on Edge Take away the data, slow the permits, raise the cost of capital, and it goes beyond simply inconveniencing traders.","The U.S. government has now officially shut down after Republicans and Democrats failed to come to an agreement on a stopgap bill to fund operations.

The impact of this shutdown will not stop at furloughed staff or shuttered museums. In energy, a shutdown lands with real force. It deprives markets of the official data that guide trading, erodes confidence in demand signals, lifts financing costs, and slows permits for the projects that underpin future supply. Oil, gas, and power don’t stop moving, but they move in murkier conditions, and that’s when small shocks hit harder.

Energy Statistics Under Pressure

The first casualty is visibility. The U.S. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) sets the weekly rhythm with its petroleum and gas reports. They’ve gone dark before during a government shutdown, but not since 2013. Today, however, the agency’s staffing is already stretched thin after recent departures. As oil trader John Kilduff told Reuters, “The EIA data contributed greatly to price discovery and it leveled the playing field. It would be very damaging to not have that data.” Without it, traders lean harder on private surveys and ship-tracking, which are less reliable and more fragmented. Prices swing wider because a common reference point is missing.

Every Wednesday, the EIA’s petroleum report delivers inventory balances for crude, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Traders position ahead of it, algorithms react to it, and refiners hedge around it. The report is not perfect, but it is universal. With its disappearance, markets will rely more heavily on the American Petroleum Institute’s (API) private survey, or on data vendors that piece together customs and terminal flows. Those sources are narrower and often contradictory. A small refinery outage in the Midwest or a fog delay on the Gulf Coast can suddenly drive outsized moves because no national dataset arrives to balance it out.

Beyond Energy Statistics

The Bureau of Labor Statistics and BEA have both said they will suspend key reports during this shutdown. That leaves the Fed and markets without employment or inflation numbers. RBC Economics warned in a recent note that “if we have a government shutdown on October 1st, the employment report will not be published.” Without jobs and inflation reports, oil markets cannot calibrate demand growth expectations, and natural gas traders cannot benchmark industrial burn against broader economic momentum.

The economic drag is more than symbolic. Bank of America estimates that each week of shutdown could trim U.S. GDP by 0.1 percentage point. Run that through the International Energy Agency’s elasticity for OECD oil demand, and it works out to 6,000-12,000 barrels per day of lost consumption each week. On a base of 20 million barrels per day, that may sound trivial, but in markets already tight on diesel and leaning on thin gasoline inventories, the psychological effect is magnified. Traders are quick to mark down refinery margins or bid up cracks if they believe consumers are pulling back.

Natural gas markets feel the impact even faster. The EIA’s Thursday storage report is the single number traders lean on to judge whether supply is keeping pace ahead of winter. This spring, a run of 100+ Bcf injections kept volatility in check because the market could see storage was filling. Take that report away, and traders are guessing. Options get repriced, spark spreads start driving the trade, and utilities hedge more cautiously. With U.S. LNG exports running flat out, that storage figure is not only vital for domestic balance sheets but also for European buyers who depend on U.S. cargoes through the cold months.

Financing Feels the Strain

Shutdowns often push Treasury yields higher, which in turn raises borrowing costs for energy producers. For shale independents already under pressure, that can mean tighter credit just as they need it most. With the SEC and CFTC set to furlough staff, capital raises will slow, and Commitments of Traders reports will be delayed, removing another guidepost for futures positioning. Energy debt spreads could widen quickly when investors fear both weaker demand and delayed oversight.

Regulatory Slowdown

Agencies such as FERC and BOEM cannot process environmental reviews or lease sales if their staff are off the clock. That leaves LNG terminals, pipelines, and offshore projects waiting. Developers build their calendars around Washington’s, and every week of delay has a cost. For investors, it is one more reminder that U.S. energy infrastructure cannot move forward without federal signatures. The Biden administration’s efforts to accelerate permitting for clean hydrogen, CCS, and transmission lines could also stall, leaving renewables and low-carbon projects with longer timelines.

International Influence

OPEC+ relies heavily on U.S. stock data to gauge balances. A blackout in Washington forces them to lean more on proprietary flows, which makes quota debates even murkier. Asian refiners, which follow EIA reports closely to track U.S. export flows, would also be left guessing. When the world’s largest consumer of oil and gas cannot publish timely data, it leaves the global system less stable.

Brace for Oil Price Volatility

A shutdown doesn’t change how much oil is in Gulf Coast tanks or how cold Minnesota gets in January. What it changes is the market’s confidence in those numbers. When traders can’t trust the data, they build in extra risk. That usually means crude prices hold firmer at the front of the curve, gasoline and diesel move harder when local supplies tighten, and gas options get more expensive because no one knows where storage really stands.

Timing makes it worse. If jobs and inflation reports are delayed until the Fed’s late October meeting, policymakers are flying blind. They can either cut on the limited evidence in front of them or wait it out. Traders already expect rate cuts by year-end, and the lack of fresh data becomes its own kind of signal that markets have to price in.

Shutdown Leaves Energy Markets on Edge

Take away the data, slow the permits, raise the cost of capital, and it goes beyond simply inconveniencing traders. It changes the way the system functions. Kilduff, RBC, and Bank of America are looking at different pieces of the puzzle, but they all point to the same reality: Politics aside, markets are worried about this shutdown because they can’t trade what they can’t see.

A judicial consensus is forming against climate lawfare, but the U.S. Supreme Court must still end environmental extortion of American energy. In two landmark cases, the court will soon have the opportunity to reassert the federal government’s authority over questions of national energy and environmental policy.

Environmental groups believe that energy use increases global temperatures, causes sea levels to rise and creates more destructive weather. Their campaign to curtail energy has taken many forms — including asking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to block pipelines and the Interior Department to deny oil and gas leases — but it met a roadblock with the 2024 election and the Trump administration’s subsequent blizzard of executive orders lifting overregulation.

Rather than pursue their interests in Congress or before the electorate, environmental extremists have now allied with bankrupt cities and trial lawyers to use the courts to shake down the energy industry. Blue cities and states have filed tort suits in state courts to extract money for allegedly causing weather-related costs in their jurisdictions.

TRUMP ADMIN SCORES LEGAL WIN IN $16B CLIMATE FIGHT AS FEDERAL APPEALS COURT LIFTS BLOCK ON GRANT TERMINATIONS

The Supreme Court will soon decide whether to take up one of those cases, Boulder County v. Suncor Energy, following a ruling this year from the Colorado Supreme Court that allowed the county’s case to move forward in state court. Borrowing theories of liability from tobacco and opioid litigation, Boulder alleges that energy companies sold their products without disclosing climate risks. Such claims plainly intrude on federal authority over interstate pollution.

Other climate cases are still progressing in lower state courts. In Hawaii, summary judgment motions are pending in a case seeking damages for rising sea levels. Hawaii’s highest court allowed this litigation to move forward in 2023 with Justice Todd Eddins issuing a remarkable concurrence, declaring that litigation would proceed under the ""Aloha Spirit,"" regardless of federal precedent.

In Rhode Island, the state judge presiding over a similar lawsuit against the energy industry compared it to developing nations devastated by natural disasters, citing Kenya, Tanzania and the Seychelles. The suggestion that Rhode Island has suffered comparable ""severe destruction"" is telling: judges are inflating rhetoric to justify climate claims, not grounding them in law.

Meanwhile, other states are effectively trying to replace federal authority over environmental policy. In Louisiana, plaintiffs obtained a $750 million judgment (potentially over $1 billion with interest) against Chevron for coastal erosion that they claimed was caused by oil extraction during World War II. Those companies had been under federal contracts to supply aviation fuel for the war effort. Yet eight decades later, Louisiana claims it can punish those practices retroactively.

The energy firms sought to move the case to federal court because of its genesis in work for the federal government. But a divided 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel refused to allow it. As Judge Andrew Oldham rightly noted in dissent, crude oil extraction plainly ""relates to"" war production. If states can sue private businesses for their wartime work generations later, future cooperation with the federal government will be chilled, raising the costs of national defense. This coming term, the Supreme Court will review the Fifth Circuit's decision.

Despite some disappointing rulings from activist judges, a growing number of state courts are beginning to resist such frivolous claims. A Maryland judge rejected Baltimore’s lawsuit that alleged fossil fuels caused sea rises that have harmed the city; the Maryland Supreme Court will hear the appeal later in October. A South Carolina court dismissed Charleston’s similar claims, which blue city officials will almost certainly appeal as well. Likewise, nearly identical state and municipal lawsuits have been similarly dismissed in Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and New Jersey.

Notwithstanding some recent wins, climate lawfare is like Hydra — new cases are constantly being brought. Even if higher courts ultimately overturn them, simply forcing the industry to defend against these suits imposes enormous litigation costs. That alone is a victory for environmental radicals. At this stage, the Supreme Court must act to reaffirm federal authority over national energy and environmental policy.

HUGHES: National Clean Energy Week highlighted a variety of energy sources and technologies ranging from hydropower to nuclear power.","Given the deep partisan divides on America’s energy future, heralding the potential of bipartisan action on clean power might seem to some like a fool’s errand.

Since the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump has launched an assault on renewable energy while taking significant steps to boost the fossil fuel industry. The president has made clear his disdain for wind and solar, describing them in one Truth Social post as “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY” while pushing a slew of regulatory actions to curtail their development.

Many congressional Republicans appeared to back that stance in the party’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly accelerating the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects that had been promised federal support under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Some Democrats, in response, have cast doubt on whether they can work in good faith with their Republican colleagues on even technology-neutral legislative priorities for the energy sector amid the administration’s “bad faith” attacks on renewables.

But to one conservative climate advocate, forging a coalition of Republicans and Democrats to support clean power isn’t just possible—it’s the industry’s best chance at averting even worse outcomes.

Heather Reams is the president and CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center organization promoting conservative solutions to reduce emissions and advance clean energy policy.

She has also served as the chair of National Clean Energy Week since its inception in 2017. The event brings together industry voices and lawmakers from across the political spectrum for rounds of speeches and panel discussions on the industry’s top priorities.

This year’s speakers ranged from one of the leaders of the conservative climate movement, U.S. Sen. John Curtis of Utah, to Democratic U.S. Rep. Scott Peters from California and executives from across the clean energy sector.

From hydropower to permitting reform, the two-day policymakers symposium in mid-September highlighted ways in which industry stakeholders and lawmakers across the political divide could cooperate to advance shared energy goals.

The event wasn’t without controversy. Climate protestors interrupted remarks from the first guest, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, targeting her for voting in favor of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—with one protester holding a sign deriding the entire gathering as “Climate Colonialism Week.”

Michael Greenberg, the leader of activist group Climate Defiance, later told Inside Climate News that the sign was “a reference to the displacement and natural disasters that high-emission/high-impact countries are causing in the Global South.”

“The main reason we were there is to confront Murkowski, and point out the hypocrisy of her being celebrated at a clean energy conference just months after she cast the tie-breaking vote for the ‘Big Evil Bill,’” Greenberg said.

The event’s sponsors also notably included fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil and BP, and many of the symposium’s speakers spotlighted natural gas as a “clean” energy source, despite significant controversy over its true impact on the climate. Although natural gas produces less carbon dioxide when burned than coal, critics say that leaks of the climate super-pollutant methane during extraction and transportation make it just as harmful for the climate as other fossil fuels.

Following this year’s gathering, Reams spoke to Inside Climate News about why she believes her “big tent” approach—both within the energy sector and on Capitol Hill—is still the best path forward for America’s clean energy future.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

AIDAN HUGHES: This has obviously been a challenging year for renewable energy development in the United States, particularly for wind and solar.

Those two technologies have seen significant cuts and efforts to claw back tax credits, permits, approvals, etc., at the federal level. How did those actions affect the planning and tone for this year’s National Clean Energy Week?

HEATHER REAMS: We were talking to our different stakeholders and partners and those that were speaking or sponsoring [National Clean Energy Week], talking to them about their priorities and how they wanted to present them, and making sure it was more in a bipartisan fashion.

And I think everyone we talked to was like, “We really want bipartisanship. We’re not after partisanship.”

And then talking to members of Congress as they were coming to make their comments, I think they were also looking at a “We need every electron,” more of an abundance type of argument—whether they were Republicans or Democrats, talking about the demand for energy.

So I think there was more of a “Let’s reset where we’ve been, post-reconciliation tax credits, and focus on what our country needs to be competitive.” …

I’ll flag, also, that the week before clean energy week, I was at [renewable energy conference] RE+ in Las Vegas. I found that same tone there. … We’re beyond tax credits now, and we’re ready to solve big problems. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that the renewable energy industry, while they have some bumps and bruises, were ready to move forward, are looking towards permitting reform that will help create more business certainty and reduce costs, and we’re prepared to be part of the conversation.

HUGHES: On that note, despite the challenges that the industry has faced this year, there was a significant amount of optimism during the policymakers symposium from both industry voices and lawmakers about the future of clean energy.

So what do you see as the path forward for clean energy to make the case to policymakers at the federal level and at the state level, that it’s a necessary investment for both the environment and the economy?

REAMS: By removing renewable energy, you’re not only reducing choices, but you’re increasing—potentially increasing—prices. So I think that’s one piece.

I think another piece is that it’s the jobs, right? The innovations that renewable energies have brought, have [also] brought good-paying jobs in all parts of the country. … These are jobs that are going to keep our country economically competitive with other nations.

And there’s a lot of talk about competition with China, and how China is producing so much more, but the innovation is on our side. … We are the innovators even though China does manufacture a lot of what we end up inventing.

So I think there’s [an] “all of the above”/abundance piece, and depending which side of the aisle you’re sitting on, it is actually the Venn diagram bringing Republicans and Democrats together to acknowledge that to move forward as a country, we need to be able to keep prices low, and we need all the energy we can get.

HUGHES: You’ve mentioned a couple of times now that emphasis on bipartisanship.

That emphasis was clear through the diverse range of lawmakers that were invited to speak at the event, from [Republican] Congressman Bruce Westerman to [Democratic] Rep. Scott Peters.

The symposium started, though, with a pushback against that. … The group Climate Defiance interrupted Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s speech, in protest against her role in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which made significant cuts to wind and solar.

So what would you say to those who would argue that lawmakers who voted for measures that have had a negative impact on the development of clean energy shouldn’t be getting a platform at National Clean Energy Week?

REAMS: I would consider this group to be a more extreme group, a left group. And then there are extreme groups on the right as well. And they have their role and purpose. We didn’t love having the protesting, but we recognize it can happen.

A couple things on the bill. Lisa Murkowski—first, she was instrumental in helping the reconciliation bill that came out of the Senate not be as bad, and she deserves a lot of credit for that. There are a handful of members in the Senate that were working to remove provisions like an excise tax on renewable energy that would have been detrimental to the industry.

A protest like that doesn’t give her that credit. It only looks at the outcome of the vote versus the process that goes on in developing these bills.

Second, the bill is huge. That bill did a lot for energy, but it also was focused a lot on nutrition, SNAP benefits, defense, immigration. It wasn’t a vote on one singular issue. It was a mega-bill with a lot of GOP priorities and the political pressure was really significant.

We, [a] number of organizations, really, were working just to make the bill better for renewable energy. And we knew that was probably the best we can get based on the political makeup of Congress, and of course the president being Republican.

And then three, there are plenty of members of Congress who have never supported renewable energy on the right—have not been a champion for renewable energy, [haven’t] talked about it, [haven’t] tried to protect it.

And if you’re really going to protest somebody, I think there are just better members to protest than Lisa Murkowski. She’s one of the most productive Republican members on “all the above,” both for renewables and fossil fuels.

So I know it’s convenient to protest an event that’s open to the public and open to the press and speak like that, but in the end, I think she was able to message and show “people can be upset with the outcomes. I’m not entirely happy with the outcome, but this is what we’re going to do moving forward.”

I think she acknowledged the frustration of others, including herself, and is ready to move on.

HUGHES: We’ve seen a significantly shifting landscape for renewable energy across recent administrations.

Just in the past few years, for example, you had this massive boost to the development of new renewable projects through the tax credits and promises made in the Inflation Reduction Act from former President Biden and a Democrat-controlled Congress, only for many of those commitments to be scaled back by the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress.

What would you say to businesses who might be worried that clean energy simply isn’t a safe or reliable investment given the pendulum swing of U.S. policy with each change in administration?

REAMS: I’d say—I wouldn’t actually put this towards clean energy. I would say that any business that wants to invest in the United States is concerned about investing in the United States now.

There’s no research on the amount of capital that’s not being deployed right now because of the uncertainty. But I can imagine it’s a pretty big number, and a frightening number because of the regulatory uncertainty that we see, and that’s a problem for the competitiveness of our country.

It’s not just clean energy. I talked to a lot of energy companies on the fossil fuel side that are concerned. I talked to a lot of multinational companies that do lots of manufacturing that are concerned. And so I think American policy makers, regardless of what letter is next to their name, should be concerned and should be taking measures to create more stability in our regulatory framework.

I think a place to start would be in permitting to create some more certainty. But certainly the volatility in the U.S. is not putting out the welcome mat for companies to come and invest and build. So it’s unfortunately not just clean energy companies that are experiencing this volatility.

HUGHES: National Clean Energy Week highlighted a variety of energy sources and technologies ranging from hydropower to nuclear power.

One of the sources that received a significant amount of attention, though, was natural gas.

There’s obviously some controversy surrounding natural gas as a clean energy source. According to the co-director of the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium, if methane emissions from natural gas are on the high end of current estimates, natural gas may be no cleaner of an energy source than coal.

National Clean Energy Week’s sponsors also included fossil fuel interests, including ExxonMobil, BP and the American Gas Association.

So how would you respond to critics who might argue that these technologies and industries shouldn’t be part of the conversation when it comes to promoting clean energy?

REAMS: I think that’s been one of the problems with talking about the transition from fossil fuels to lowering emissions, right? Whether it’s just transition and getting to a more “all the above,” a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy.

There’s a lot of talk about eventually going to solar and wind, plus peaker plants for gas as a longer-term solution, until we can come up with the next technology that’s going to help lower emissions. So that includes peaker plants with natural gas, right?

I think credit should be given where credit’s due. Displacing coal with natural gas has reduced emissions by 40 percent in the United States. So is that cleaner? Yes. Is it the cleanest? No—but it’s cleaner.

Every technology has its drawbacks, and what we’re seeing is that carbon capture and methane capture, plus natural gas, is going to help reduce emissions.

Normally, energy in our country has been additive. I don’t really see that changing. But what we do see a lot of changes is with the innovations that can help improve this technology. So that’s why we’re looking at natural gas plus carbon capture plus methane capture, and giving those policies a voice at the table. So we did have people talking about carbon capture, for instance, as part of a solution—innovative technologies.

So right now, we believe in a bigger tent—a tent that is going to allow entities to be able to share their perspectives and their solutions.

Another piece that often goes unnoticed is that fossil fuel companies are funding a lot of R&D on lower-carbon technologies. Hydrogen, for instance, or like [carbon capture and storage] and [carbon capture utilization and storage]. So they’re putting a lot of money into this, and they deserve to have a seat at the table, because they are trying to reduce emissions.

I think a bigger tent is going to help us not create the “who can and who shouldn’t be at the table,” but really be a more inclusive place for us to solve big problems together.

That’s one of the problems that I’ve seen with one side of the aisle, the Democratic party, trying to solve climate change. It isn’t working. The policies aren’t durable.

We need left and the right, Republicans and Democrats, trying to solve big problems. And climate change is a very big problem that we need to solve, and we’re not going to do it with just a slice or sliver of the population or the industry trying to solve it.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NCEW-Policymaker-Symposium-2024TTAS5150.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 05:59:36.633696

Officials with the new Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, formerly the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources, say the changes will place it on a more modern and transparent footing to balance ""economic growth and environmental stewardship.""

The changes are also expected, the department's secretary has said, to enhance enforcement of the state's oil and gas sector. It will also streamline permitting, a change welcomed by the industry.

""In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago. Technology, industry and environmental best practices have changed a great deal over those decades, and it’s time this agency caught up,"" Dustin Davidson, secretary of the renamed department, said in a statement earlier this month.

Often at the center of complex disputes in a state rich with energy resources, the department has a large and expanding footprint. It has a hand in regulating oil and gas, pipelines, wind and solar energy, underground injection, carbon capture and sequestration, groundwater use, and development in the coastal zone.

Department officials warned that, though the reorganization would be in effect Wednesday, the full integration from operating under the old structure to the new one could take time.

Among the changes instituted this spring and summer by the Legislature, the reorganization has also done away with a district dating from the mid-1970s that oversaw groundwater use to prevent saltwater intrusion into the Baton Rouge-area's aquifer. Groundwater regulation in Baton Rouge is now fully under the control of the newly reorganized state agency.

Oil and gas groups welcomed the broader reorganization, while one environmental group said it expected to see little difference from what they claimed is an agency that has been an industry ""rubber stamp.""

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, pointed out that the former department secretary who led the reorganization, Tyler Gray, previously led an industry trade group, the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association.

""This agency is designed by the oil industry for its own benefit, and that should scare everyone in this state,"" Rolfes said.

Tommy Faucheux, the current president of LMOGA, countered that his trade group is optimistic the changes will clear up red tape and uncertainty, a shift that is ""essential for the state to prosper.""

""It’s important that our state’s regulatory structure can challenge industry to improve while working productively to foster the economic opportunities in oil and gas that will keep our kids here in Louisiana,"" he said.

Six new offices

Faucheux and Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, also welcomed the arrival of Davidson as the new secretary. Faucheux highlighted his experience with energy policy, while Moncla cited his past work with Davidson, who was previously DENR deputy secretary and a former congressional staffer in Washington.

Gray, Landry's first appointment to the department, led the reorganization until he stepped down last month. The effort followed an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry early in his term.

The new department will go by the acronym ""C&E,"" which had been the Department of Natural Resources for decades before an earlier name change in January 2024 to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

Implemented through two regular sessions and one special legislative session, the changes did away with the historical Office of Conservation and shuffled offices within the new department while boosting their number from four to six.

The Office of Conservation was Louisiana's chief oil-and-gas regulator since the early days of the state's petroleum industry. The office's gubernatorially appointed commissioners retained independent regulatory powers through the years even after the office was folded inside DNR.

The Legislature, at department officials' urging, first removed the administrative division between the department and the office. It then did away with the conservation commissioner and vested the commissioner's powers in the secretary of the new department.

In the most recent session, Act 458, sponsored by state Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, was the primary vehicle for the reorganization. Many of its more than 225 pages removed responsibilities from the state commissioner of conservation and handed them to the new C&E secretary.

Among the six new offices, the reorganization consolidated oil, gas and coastal management permitting and compliance, the latter of which affects wetlands development, under one Office of Permitting and Compliance.

A separate division, the Office of Enforcement, will handle inspection and enforcement of permitted oil and gas wells and other activities for which the state has regulatory primacy, such as underground injection and carbon capture.

'Win over the public trust'

In a recent speech to carbon capture executives at LSU, Davidson emphasized the significance of separating permitting from enforcement.

""We saw that as something that needed to change significantly because a lot of times you had folks that were having those relationships with the applicants that then had to turn around and enforce actions against those applicants. Sometimes that can be difficult,"" Davidson said in the Sept. 5 speech.

He added that the department has a ""robust enforcement system that, I would say, in the past has not been used to our advantage the way it should have been.""

Davidson said enforcement is the department's ""biggest tool to win over the public trust.""

Other new offices include the offices of the secretary, administration, state resources and energy.

Other changes took effect last year, including a bill that created the Natural Resources Trust Authority to handle the financial security of state oil and gas wells.

The authority is designed to ensure enough money has been set aside to plug a well if an operator goes out of business, so the well isn't orphaned and becomes the state's responsibility. Louisiana has more than 4,900 orphan wells.

The high bidder on both leases in today’s sale is Warrior Met Coal Mining, LLC, with a submitted total bid in the amount of $46,816,000.

“This lease sale is another example of how the Department of the Interior is delivering on President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy, strengthen rural economies and secure fair returns for the American people,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By expanding access to America’s world-class metallurgical coal reserves, we are creating good-paying jobs, supporting domestic steel production, and reinforcing our nation’s Energy Dominance.”

The lease sale advances the Trump administration’s priorities under Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy, which directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers and encourage responsible energy development on public lands. It also fulfills key provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which established regular coal lease sales, reduced royalty rates, and streamlined leasing reviews to revitalize American energy production.

Yet despite its growth, solar still faces efficiency limits and performance bottlenecks. Two emerging technologies, quantum dots and gallium nitride (GaN) promise to redefine the future of photovoltaics, from utility-scale fields to futuristic solar windows.

Nanotechnology Meets Sunlight with Quantum Dots

In a recent interview with Hunter McDaniel, CEO of UbiQD, a detailed explantion of the technology was presented. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanoparticles so small that one dot compared to a golf ball is like a golf ball compared to planet Earth. Their power lies in their ability to manipulate light with extraordinary precision. With the adjustment of their size and composition, QDs can shift light from cooler blue tones to warmer red tones, with photoluminescence efficiencies exceeding 90%.

In solar energy, this means optimizing the sun’s spectrum so panels capture more usable light. UbiQD, working with partners like First Solar, is integrating quantum dots into utility-scale modules to improve spectral response. In other words, improving the spectral response means solar panels can convert a wider range of sunlight colors into usable electricity, raising overall performance. This has the ability to revolutionize the renewable energy sector and by extension, tackle climate change.

The technology requires no disruptive redesign, as it would be acting as a “drop-in” material that leverages existing manufacturing capacity. QDs are also enabling architectural innovations. According to the UbiQD CEO, through WENDOW® technology, solar windows embed QD-doped glass that absorbs sunlight, emits a faint glow, and channels it to the pane’s edges where solar cells convert it into electricity. This allows buildings to generate energy without compromising aesthetics, unlocking entirely new surfaces for renewable generation.

A New Era of Power Electronics With Gallium Nitride

While quantum dots optimize how sunlight is captured, gallium nitride is reshaping how that energy is converted into usable power. Silicon has long been the standard material for inverters, the devices that turn the direct current from solar panels into alternating current for buildings and the grid. However, silicon switches electricity more slowly and generates more heat.

GaN overcomes these barriers by switching much faster and wasting less energy as heat. This allows inverters to be smaller, cooler-running, and more efficient. Enphase’s IQ9N-3P Microinverter pairs one inverter with each solar panel on three-phase systems, the type of electrical setup common in larger commercial sites. This design improves reliability because if one panel has a problem, like shading, dirt, or a fault, it only affects that single panel instead of reducing the output of the entire system.

The system also integrates built-in safety and compliance features. For example the rapid shutdown lets operators cut power instantly in emergencies. Secondly, phase balancing keeps voltage stable across circuits, and fault detection identifies issues before they spread. Remote monitoring reduces the need for on-site visits, lowering operating costs while improving oversight.

In short, GaN enables power electronics that are more compact, reliable, and efficient, an innovation that directly complements quantum dots. Together, these renewable energy technology show how material science is not only making solar panels better at capturing light but also more effective at delivering it to the grid.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68dca36b09e131bcc717063b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-01 09:00:46.264058
,Detroit and Evs,2025-10-01 08:47:04+00:00,Grist,"E-Bikes could cut carbon, congestion, and costs — if cities take them seriously - Grist.org","Matt Simon, Sophie Hurwitz",,,,,https://grist.org/transportation/e-bikes-could-cut-carbon-congestion-and-costs-if-cities-take-them-seriously/,"Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing — and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars — providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option.
Even in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed.
“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said.
None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes.
“So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”","Last year, San Francisco voters did something exceedingly rare in car-crazy America: They closed two miles of a coastal highway to vehicles, creating a sprawling park for pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists. Of course, furious residents in the neighborhood bordering the erstwhile highway voted last month to recall their representative at City Hall for championing the transformation and, to their minds, creating a traffic nightmare on side streets — even though commute times in the area have grown by just a few minutes since the closure.

The battle in the City by the Bay is emblematic of the inflection point facing cities nationally. As more electric vehicles hit the road, the temptation is to invest heavily in the infrastructure — roads, highways, parking lots — that will preserve the status quo of prioritizing cars over people. Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing — and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars — providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option. The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?

Cities and states throughout the country are taking steps to make existing infrastructure more accommodating to those who prefer to pedal. They are lowering vehicle speed limits, building designated bike lanes, providing charging, and ensuring underserved neighborhoods don’t get left behind. All of this has been a big change in just the past few years, given that some locales didn’t regulate e-bikes at all until the late 2010s, said Leigh Ann Von Hagen, director of the Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. “All states have seen the writing on the wall,” she said.

The promise of the e-bike is that it can help people of every age. Parents are carting children around on beefy models with built-in bins. Workers can use them to get to and from their jobs. Shoppers can slap saddle bags over the rear fender to haul groceries. And elderly folks, who may not be confident in their ability to operate a conventional pedaller, can use them in lieu of driving. “I have an uncle in Tennessee who started riding an e-bike when he retired because he just didn’t want to drive to the store anymore,” Von Hagen said.

In addition to that lowering of carbon emissions — how much exactly will depend on the city and the rate of e-bike adoption, but the drop may be somewhere around 12 percent — there’s also the harder-to-quantify health benefits of people exercising more. Plus, fewer cars spewing pollution improves air quality and public health. EVs, too, release their own form of pollution: Because they’re heavier than combustion cars, their tires and brakes produce more microplastics that sully the air and wash out to sea.

Drivers may experience range anxiety about their electric vehicle not having the juice to reach their destination, but the opposite is true for e-bikers. Older people or those with medical conditions might avoid conventional cycling because they worry about having the energy to make it somewhere, especially if there are hills in their way. With e-bike ranges far exceeding the average distance that riders are traveling (around 6 miles), range anxiety can be higher for those providing their own pedalling power. “When we do interviews with people, they will use the e-bike on eco, or even off, when they’re on flat terrain, and as soon as they get to that hill, they consistently report putting it up to the maximum,” said Jessica Bourne, an active travel researcher at the University of Bristol in the UK. “As one participant described it: It’s just flattening their journey.”

You can see the potential for e-bikes to replace cars in how their riders compare to those on conventional bikes. Given that e-bike users have the option to let the motor do all the work, you might assume that they’re burning fewer calories. But research has shown that riders tend to travel significantly farther on e-bikes, meaning they’re getting about as much physical activity as those taking shorter trips on conventional bikes.

Put another way: It’s less exertion, but more time spent exercising and running errands. “Once you account for increased frequency and increased duration and distance traveled, they spend longer on the bike overall, so they’re actually expending more energy on a weekly basis,” Bourne said. “That’s why they have more potential to substitute for motorized vehicles.”

Indeed, several studies have shown that people are already replacing car trips with e-bike rides on a wide scale. And the more bike-friendly cities make themselves, the more people opt for two wheels: Between 2009 and 2014, commuting by conventional bikes and electric versions doubled in New York City and Washington D.C thanks in part to better bicycle infrastructure. E-bike sales in North America doubled between 2018 and 2021. (So too have e-bike and e-scooter related injuries increased, due largely to insufficient and unsafe infrastructure for riders.)

Established cycling havens like the Netherlands — where the average person rides 680 miles a year, despite the chill of winter — show just how much the built environment can influence travel choices. “In the Netherlands, we say there’s no bad weather — there’s only bad clothing,” said Joost de Kruijf, a travel behavior researcher at Dutch Cycling Intelligence. “Once you reach a kind of threshold where you do all your trips by bicycle, then it just becomes a habit.”

The challenge, though, is that e-bikes remain expensive — anywhere from around $1,000 to over ten times that amount — putting them out of reach of the people who could benefit the most. Low-income folks without cars would get access to more employment opportunities if they had e-bikes, Bourne said, because they can travel farther, and often more conveniently. Similarly, young people would have greater access to education opportunities at colleges beyond walking distance or transit routes. That’s especially true if they’re living car-free somewhere with poor public transportation, a problem known to researchers as transport poverty.

The solution, Bourne said, is to subsidize e-bikes. California, for instance, has provided up to $2,000 for low-income residents to buy them, though the program is no longer accepting applications. Denver has offered similar support. “If it’s going to benefit the planet and it’s going to reduce the cars on the road, then why don’t we provide the subsidies for e-bikes, as we do for electric cars?” Bourne asks. “It just seems bananas to me.”

In fact, studies have shown that rebates incentivizing EV purchases and rebates that incentivize e-bikes can be equally effective, both costing about a dollar per ton of avoided carbon dioxide emissions, at least in British Columbia. “The big difference is electric bike incentives come with a whole range of other co-benefits,” said Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering and planning at the University of British Columbia. “Whereas electric car incentives actually have some downsides, because we know it incentivizes even more driving, which makes congestion worse, and leads to more sedentary lifestyles, and leads to higher infrastructure costs.” (Some research has shown what’s called a rebound effect: Because electric vehicles are cheaper to operate, there can be a modest increase in total vehicle miles traveled.)

Indeed, in a report published last week, Bigazzi found that an e-bike rebate program in British Columbia helped recipients increase their cycling by 25 miles per week and reduce their car use by almost 11 miles. That, in turn, reduced emissions from travel by 17 percent per year, and increased physical activity during travel by 13 percent. Denver has said its popular e-bike voucher program has helped eliminate 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.

Experts say cities could also start to think about bike share programs as an extension of their public transportation system. “It really is a public benefit to get people from point A to point B without needing to park or drive a car,” said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. “There is an argument that having some sort of public subsidy, like public transit does, could greatly increase the number of folks that are able to use those systems.”

Cities where those programs already exist have seen success. Citi Bike in New York, run by the rideshare company Lyft, can be a model. With over a million riders every year, the program, which provides e-bikes and conventional bikes, is an accessible part of the city’s infrastructure.

Beyond making the bikes accessible, though, lies the challenge of making cities accessible for bikes. “I think the infrastructure needs to be somehow retrofitted for these faster mobility devices,” said Greg Rybarczyk, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint, who studies e-mobility in the Detroit metro area. Making sure bikers know the rules of the road — and drivers know how to handle bikers — is critical, too. “I think there’s a long way to go in terms of driver education and marketing campaigns,” Rybarczyk said.

Even in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed. But respondents to an e-bike user survey Rybarczyk conducted say that Detroit’s bike lanes aren’t well-maintained, putting them in unsafe situations. “The street sweepers don’t sweep the bike lanes. They don’t sweep the curbs as much. There’s a lot of debris on a lot of the routes in and around Detroit.” Maintaining – and, potentially, widening – bike lanes could do a great deal for e-bike users outside of the coastal megacities. So, too, could providing accessible charging and storage facilities, according to Amelia Neptune, who coordinates the League of American Bicyclist’s infrastructure evaluation program, Bike Friendly America.

“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said. Some “bike pod” companies are offering a potential solution for those who don’t have garages at home to store their bikes. And some of the colleges and universities that work with Bike Friendly America are beginning to offer e-bike parking options in their dormitories.

None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes. The gold standard, Bigazzi said, is protected infrastructure for bikes, in which a lane is physically separated from vehicles. Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times.

Now cities face a choice: Invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists. “Cities can build out almost their whole bike network for the cost of rebuilding one or two freeway interchanges,” Bigazzi said. “So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/e-bikes-urban-design-cities-cars-health-benefits-emissions-climate.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-01 05:01:56.576146

Failure to pass the REPAIR Act will be too much of a cost for Indiana drivers.","By RUSS MILLER

Guest Columnist

Cars are an undeniable part of Indiana’s identity – from hosting the Indianapolis 500 to employing one of the nation’s largest automotive care and manufacturing workforces.

As Hoosiers, we drive more miles per year than nearly every other U.S. state. Having been in the auto industry for more than 40 years, cars are an important part of my story, too – along with the rest of my Christian Brothers Automotive team in Westfield, Ind.

I’ve always believed in doing right by my customers: fair prices, honest work, and treating people like neighbors. But in recent years, it’s become harder to live up to that promise – not because our technicians lack the skills or know-how, but because car manufacturers are locking us out of the information we need to do our jobs.

Thanks to technology, computers, and data are now just as much a part of auto repairs as a jack or a wrench. Fixing any advanced feature (backup cameras, automatic wipers, automatic braking, blind spot warnings, etc.) or even more basic parts (headlights, bumpers, fenders, etc.) can require access to a car’s repair and maintenance data. Without it, independent shops are out of luck – with more than half of us already sending up to five customer vehicles per month to more expensive, less convenient dealerships because of these repair restrictions.

For example, some models have very limited programming and require a global diagnostic system that manufacturers have ​not made available to the public. Other manufacturer systems prohibit outside users on their servers outright – meaning independent shops cannot program radios, GPS systems, or power windows on affected vehicles. We have to send these types of repairs to the dealer regularly.

These restrictions need to end. Unless Congress requires automakers to share necessary repair information, these issues will continue, and independent shops across the country could disappear from the market in years to come – including more than 112,000 automotive care industry jobs and nearly $42 billion in associated economic output here in Indiana.

In today’s political environment, it’s rare to find an issue that cuts across the aisle. But the growing movement to restore free and fair auto repair access has united lawmakers on both sides who understand what’s at stake for small businesses and working families. The REPAIR Act (H.R. 1566/S. 1379) would require automakers to share the tools and information necessary for modern repairs – leveling the playing field for independent repairers and protecting car owners’ ability to choose where they service their vehicles.

Currently, 29 percent of Hoosiers live in rural areas, which is 42 percent more than the national average. For them, independent repair access isn’t just about preference; it’s about access to critical infrastructure. Many of these families lack nearby dealerships to turn to if their local shop hits a manufacturer’s block or ceases to exist altogether. Restricting auto repairs doesn’t just inconvenience folks; it isolates them.

Passing the REPAIR Act will ensure Hoosiers, not car companies, are in control of how their vehicles are repaired. Building on Sen. Jim Banks’ co-sponsorship of the REPAIR Act last session as a member of the House of Representatives, we urge Sen. Banks, Sen. Todd Young, and the rest of our state’s congressional delegation: put Hoosiers first and support this important legislation.

When small shops are blocked from repairs, the impact is felt in paychecks, apprenticeship pipelines, and on Main Street businesses statewide. Failure to pass the REPAIR Act will be too much of a cost for Indiana drivers.

We encourage Congress to stand up for market competition, consumer choice, and the right to fix what’s ours.

The sources of air pollution are varied and geographically diverse.
According to the World Health Organization, household air pollution alone was responsible for 3.8 million deaths, or 7.7% of the global mortality in 2018.
Dirty Cleaning Products Another source of indoor air pollution are cleaning products.
“Reducing these sources of indoor and outdoor air pollution are part of what is considered mitigation to climate change,” she said.","AMSTERDAM — That air pollution is a primary antagonist to pulmonary health has been known for a long time, but the true extent of its detrimental effects may reach far beyond the lungs. Air pollutants infiltrate the bloodstream, damage multiple organ systems, and contribute significantly to global mortality.

Pulmonary experts and epidemiologists at European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress 2025 discussed the well-documented dangers of outdoor air pollution and the often-overlooked hazards lurking within our own homes, from traditional cooking fuels to everyday cleaning products.

Air pollution is a multi-faceted global health crisis that demands immediate and comprehensive action, Kristie Ebi, PhD, an environmental epidemiologist and professor of global health and environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, said at the Congress. “The literature has expanded significantly over the last several years, moving beyond impacts directly on the pulmonary system,” she said.

She explained that fine particulate matter, specifically PM2.5, is capable of crossing the lung-blood barrier, therefore entering the bloodstream and affecting a wide array of organ systems. This systemic invasion transforms what was once considered a purely respiratory issue into a cardiovascular, neurological, and systemic threat, she said.

According to data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, air pollution is the second leading risk factor for illness and death, and the most vulnerable to it are children and older adults. Low-income countries, such as South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, also bear the biggest burden.

The sources of air pollution are varied and geographically diverse. In regions like East and South Asia, coal combustion remains a significant contributor. In other parts of the world, oil, gas, and biofuels are the primary culprits.

In addition, a growing body of research, triggered by the increase of climate-driven wildfires, has shown that fire-related particulate matter is especially concerning. “Fire-related particulate matter is much more toxic than regular PM2.5,” Ebi said. For instance, in one study, researchers found that underestimating this specific risk could be off by as much as 93%.

The Hidden Dangers in Indian Kitchens

While outdoor pollution sources, such as traffic and industry often dominate public discourse, a significant portion of the global population is exposed to dangerously high levels of pollution within their own homes. Naresh Chandra Gupta, PhD, a professor at the University School of Environment Management in Delhi, India, presented a study on the effects of biomass fuel use in India, where around 41% of the population relies on biomass for cooking and heating, particularly in rural and marginalized communities, according to the India’s Centre for Science and Environment.

The traditional cookstoves, or chulhas, used in these homes are notoriously inefficient, converting a large portion of the fuel into smoke rather than heat, Gupta explained. This smoke contains a toxic cocktail of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1), black carbon (soot), hydrocarbons, and harmful gases like carbon monoxide, which have been associated with a wide range of disease, including respiratory infections and cancers. According to the World Health Organization, household air pollution alone was responsible for 3.8 million deaths, or 7.7% of the global mortality in 2018.

Gupta’s research documented the indoor air quality in homes using biomass vs those using cleaner liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). He found that homes using biomass had PM2.5 levels averaging over 700 μg/m3, with peaks exceeding 1900 during cooking hours, while in the household that used LPG levels were lower.

The health implications are especially severe on women because they are generally the ones who spend hours cooking in these conditions. Gupta’s study found a significantly higher prevalence of chronic cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath among women using biomass fuels. Pulmonary function tests revealed a much higher incidence of obstructive and restrictive patterns, with a pooled odds ratio indicating that biomass exposure increased the risk of developing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by 2.65 times. “The specific contribution of biomass fuel to declining lung function and respiratory diseases in women still remains under-investigated,” Gupta said, hinting that the true burden of disease is likely even higher.

The study also highlighted the important role of ventilation. Homes with poorly ventilated kitchens had exponentially higher pollutant concentrations and their inhabitants suffered from more severe respiratory symptoms.

Dirty Cleaning Products

Another source of indoor air pollution are cleaning products. Sara De Matteis, MD, MPH, PhD, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, said typical household products are a heavily underestimated hazard. “Cleaning products are in every house, in every building, and there has been a striking increase in their use in the last decades, particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. This surge in use means a surge in exposure to a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds, acids, bases, solvents, disinfectants, and even ultrafine particles. And similarly to the Indian case, cleaning products too disproportionately affect women and children, she said.

These chemicals can easily become airborne, especially when used as sprays in poorly ventilated areas. De Matteis explained that these products can be potent respiratory irritants and sensitizers, capable of triggering asthma-like symptoms. A meta-analysis she presented revealed a 50% increased risk for such symptoms associated with exposure to cleaning products. The risk is not limited to professional cleaners but extends to the general population.

Presenting data from a large-scale UK Biobank study revealed that domestic cleaners have a 40% increased risk of developing COPD. “We were confident that this result was true because the huge sample size of UK Biobank allowed me to stratify the analysis among never-asthmatics and never-smokers,” she said. This stratification allowed her to rule out common confounders. Other studies have found that cleaning products are also associated with asthma, chronic cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction, and chronic bronchitis.

The danger not only is direct but also can be generational. A multi-center study found that maternal exposure to cleaning products around the time of conception and during pregnancy was linked to an increased risk for asthma in their children.

One big challenge De Matteis identified is the lack of transparency and regulation around product labeling. Product formulations are constantly changing, and manufacturers are often not required to disclose all ingredients, especially those present at concentrations < 1%, she explained. This makes it difficult for consumers and researchers to assess the real risks.

A Call for Integrated Solutions

The experts called for comprehensive strategies that simultaneously address various pollution sources and acknowledge their deep connections to public health and the global climate.

For household air pollution in developing nations such as India, the answer lies in a transition to cleaner fuels and more efficient, properly ventilated cooking technologies, said Gupta. Government initiatives, like India’s Ujjala Yojana program providing free LPG connections, are ongoing.

While for the hazards posed by cleaning products, De Matteis advocates for greater consumer awareness, improved product labeling, and the use of safer, greener alternatives, such as vinegar and biocarb.

To address outdoor air pollution, Ebi said, any action we take to mitigate climate change — reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, changing our consumption patterns — will have immediate and significant co-benefits for public health. “Reducing these sources of indoor and outdoor air pollution are part of what is considered mitigation to climate change,” she said. “The benefits for health of reducing these emissions will move forward on important agendas to help protect people throughout the world from exposure to air pollution.”

Ebi, Gupta, and De Matteis reported no relevant financial relationships.

But Nebraska’s energy future faces a critical threat: Washington’s broken interconnection process.
In other words: More than 90 percent of proposed energy projects never come online, largely because of delays, compliance costs and regulatory uncertainty, according to the 2024 Advanced Energy Interconnection Scorecard.
But those advantages mean nothing if federal red tape prevents us from connecting new power to the grid.
Christian Mapes is an energy pro, Army veteran, and Nebraska native.","Five years ago, as I prepared to leave my Army uniform behind, I faced two life-defining decisions. First: where to raise my young family. My wife and I knew we wanted our girls to grow up where we had, surrounded by family and Nebraska’s “Good Life.”

The second proved harder: What career would let me serve? In energy work, something clicked. As a soldier who’d served in places where reliable power wasn’t guaranteed, I understood the fundamental link between energy and prosperity.

But Nebraska’s energy future faces a critical threat: Washington’s broken interconnection process. If we want to power our homes and family farms and next-generation AI data centers, we need to drag this decades-old system into the 21st century.

News focuses too much on the sources of our power — natural gas, nuclear and renewables like wind and solar — and not nearly enough on how those power sources actually connect to the grid to send power to the places where it’s needed.

That process is called interconnection. And, as you would expect from something dominated by nearly century-old federal rules and regulations, it’s slow, difficult and expensive — and in need of serious reform.

Consider that the average wait time for new generation projects to connect to the grid has grown from less than 2 years in 2008 to nearly 5 years for projects completed in 2023. As of late 2023, roughly 2.6 terawatts of proposed generation and storage — more than twice the entire current U.S. installed capacity — sits trapped in interconnection queues nationwide.

In our part of the country, the problem is acute. For projects submitted between 2018-2020 across the Southwest Power Pool, completion rates fell below 10 percent. In other words: More than 90 percent of proposed energy projects never come online, largely because of delays, compliance costs and regulatory uncertainty, according to the 2024 Advanced Energy Interconnection Scorecard.

This bottleneck threatens to become catastrophic as demand for electricity climbs faster than it has in decades. Data centers, AI, electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing are reshaping America’s grid.

Here in Nebraska, the Omaha Public Power District is planning for roughly 100 megawatts in additional demand each year — an enormous jump from the handful of megawatts we previously added annually.

When we can’t connect new, cheaper power sources quickly enough to meet growing demand, we’re forced to rely on more expensive alternatives, especially during peak times. That’s a key reason why Nebraska families have watched their utility bills tick upwards over the past few years.

While federal regulators have attempted some piecemeal reforms, the backlog remains massive, and the process still moves too slowly for the growth we expect.

Solutions aren’t complicated. First, FERC must ensure its new cluster-study deadlines are met and enforceable. Projects that meet technical requirements deserve timely decisions, not indefinite delays.

Second, American interconnection should transition to a “connect and manage” approach, similar to those used in Europe – where ready projects can connect to the grid while system upgrades proceed in parallel, with clear operating constraints to maintain reliability.

Third, Nebraska should lead a coalition of states to demand prioritization of shovel-ready projects. If a project has secured financing, ensured site control and received local support, it should move forward.

Nebraska enjoys abundant access to diverse energy resources. We have a skilled workforce, and we’re grateful to have something no other state can claim: A 100 percent public power system that puts ratepayers first instead of shareholders.

But those advantages mean nothing if federal red tape prevents us from connecting new power to the grid. It’s time to push back against broken processes and embrace a streamlined, practical approach that ensures lower rates and greater reliability.

My daughters, and every other member of Nebraska’s next generation, deserve nothing less.

Its investment in its own solar and also in exporting solar panels has helped global installation soar.
Solar panels help create affordable energy that helps save money on energy bills, increasing home value, working year-round, and reducing the need for dirty fuels.
Solar energy can also keep the price of energy down in the face of changing utility prices.","New analysis from Ember shows that solar panel installation has grown by 64% in 2025, Yale Environment 360 reported.

Ember Energy's report looked at the first six months of 2025, determining that, across the globe, 380 gigawatts of new solar energy was installed. That is up from 232 gigawatts in the same period in 2024.

""These latest numbers on solar deployment in 2025 defy gravity,"" said Ember's senior analyst, Nicolas Fulghum, ""with annual solar installations continuing their sharp rise.""

In 2024, solar set a six-year high for growth rate in energy generation. According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, solar power was the fastest-growing electricity source in the U.S. from 2010 to 2020. And it doesn't appear to have slowed down. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, solar accounted for 69% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid in the first quarter of 2025.

However, the U.S. only accounted for a portion, in part due to federal rollbacks on commercial solar projects. China accounted for much of the global growth of solar.

As of 2024, China accounted for over 80% of the world's solar manufacturing capacity, according to Yale Environment 360. Its investment in its own solar and also in exporting solar panels has helped global installation soar. In 12 months, China's exports of solar panels to Africa rose by 60%, according to Ember.

Solar panels help create affordable energy that helps save money on energy bills, increasing home value, working year-round, and reducing the need for dirty fuels. Dirty fuels, such as oil and natural gas, contribute to warming global temperatures and an increase in climate-driven weather disasters.

Investment in solar also contributes greatly to global economies. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, renewable energy tech, such as solar, employs three times as many employees as traditional energy sources do. It is also a leading job creator in the U.S. Solar energy can also keep the price of energy down in the face of changing utility prices.

""In a world of volatile energy markets, solar offers domestically produced power that can be rolled out at record speed to meet growing demand, independent of global fossil fuel supply chains,"" said Fulghum, per Ember.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QlBGxTTnZTdeJjNBv4VPzA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Nzk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/d858c22e86000eae248d90f9098fc034,N,,2025-10-01 13:03:23.416313

Now, though, one major utility’s especially slow process for reviewing applications could jeopardize further progress. Developers stuck in the interconnection queue may not be able to access key federal tax credits that were sent to an early grave by the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The beauty of community solar is that it allows anyone, even those who can’t put photovoltaic panels on their own properties, to access solar energy via subscriptions to a larger array sited elsewhere. Until congressional Republicans passed their budget law this summer, the companies building community solar could tap federal tax credits into the 2030s; now, projects must begin construction by July 2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify.

Before any power-generating project can connect to the grid, it needs to undergo a lengthy review. Utilities must determine the project’s viability and the cost of grid upgrades that it might require, which the developer usually pays for and needs to know ahead of time to secure financing. Though the process is notorious for taking too long, the actual length of time a proposal spends in this interconnection queue can vary greatly depending on the utility.

Advocates are calling out Ameren, which serves central and southern Illinois, for taking longer than the norm. One major reason is that the utility only studies community solar applications one at a time. At that rate, it takes years or even decades for proposals to be reviewed and ready for construction.

By contrast, ComEd, the utility that serves northern Illinois, reviews multiple project proposals concurrently and ​“typically performs hundreds of studies every month,” according to the ComEd team that specializes in interconnection and distributed energy resources.

Ameren currently has over 1,700 projects pending review in its interconnection queue, the vast majority of which are community solar, according to Ameren spokesperson Marcelyn Love.

The utility is moving toward studying proposals concurrently, like ComEd does, but the policy won’t be fully in place until January 2027, said Love. That’s too late for projects depending on the federal tax credit to make their finances work.

“I think we’ll see a lot of projects that can’t meet these deadlines and just fall off,” said Jessica Collingsworth, central policy director for Nexamp, a community solar developer with headquarters in Chicago and Boston. ​“Every developer is trying to start construction on as much as possible.”

How can utilities speed up the interconnection queue?

Illinois currently ranks among the top five states for community solar capacity. Illinois lawmakers kick-started this development in 2016, when they created a state program now called Illinois Shines to incentivize development of the shared arrays.

About 768 megawatts of community solar are already operating statewide, according to a report by consultancy Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. But far more proposals are pending, meaning Ameren and ComEd have needed to quickly figure out how to add increasing amounts of community solar to their grids.

ComEd now has about 200 community solar projects totaling more than 430 MW of generation in its territory, according to utility spokesperson David O’Dowd. In 2025 so far, the utility has received 442 requests for new community solar projects. It is dealing with about 750 pending applications in all, including around 80 that have interconnection agreements but are awaiting a customer signature, O’Dowd said.

Even with the glut of applications, ComEd said it has managed to complete interconnection studies and agreements in a timely fashion, in part because it studies projects concurrently.

Developers agree with that assessment. Nexamp, for example, ​“has experience in over a dozen markets and finds concurrent studies to be the fastest way to get local solar to the grid,” Collingsworth said. The firm has 31 community solar projects operating in ComEd territory and a number of proposals pending in Ameren territory.

“We need certainty around interconnection costs before we can feel confident beginning construction on projects,” said Collingsworth. ​“Anything that delays getting that certainty is a problem we need to solve quickly.”

Love said that Ameren is increasing its ​“internal and contractor resources” to be able to do multiple studies at the same time — in other words, the utility is bringing on more experts to review proposals.

“These improvements have already helped us advance 20 applications that were second in line, allowing us to both test out the concurrent study process and get more applicants information about their projects,” she said.

But the utility must balance the benefits of hiring more people to do the studies with the costs for those hires, which customers will ultimately pay for in their bills, she added.

Ameren is also working to address other reasons for interconnection delays.

For example, sometimes the utility spends a lot of time reviewing a project, only to ultimately decide it cannot be approved at all. To avoid this unnecessary use of resources, Love said Ameren is ​“studying the limits of what different circuits and substations on the grid can handle, to be able to more quickly predict when an application for connecting community solar in that area will be denied because the grid has reached its maximum capacity.”

The utility is ​“redesigning our approach to identify projects that have a high propensity for approval,” Love added, so that agreements can be signed more quickly, leaving detailed cost analyses until later in the process.

This means that Ameren ​“can get more projects through the pipeline and avoid spending time and resources on applications that are unlikely to move forward, due to high costs or other factors,” Love said.

Collingsworth said that more information and transparency from the utility make developers’ jobs easier, since they know which proposals to prioritize.

Love said Ameren has made maps and queue reports more user-friendly, so that developers will have a better idea of which projects are worth pursuing. The utility is also offering companies ​“a one-time opportunity to reduce the size of their project to help manage anticipated interconnection costs,” Love said, meaning that developers can change their proposal without having to resubmit it and lose their place in line.

While delays have not been a major problem in ComEd territory, according to developers, the utility has also taken steps to reduce interconnection wait times. It is allowing the use of a letter of credit or escrow account instead of cash as the deposit needed before construction can begin, and it is connecting developers seeking to do projects on the same part of the grid, so they can potentially collaborate to reduce costs.

State lawmakers look to ease interconnection

A clean-energy bill that state legislators may consider during an October veto session aims to hasten the interconnection process across Illinois. The legislation would create a working group composed of utilities, developers, and other stakeholders that would report to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the body that regulates energy.

The state’s 2021 clean-energy law called for an interconnection working group, but ​“it hasn’t been a very productive space,” Collingsworth said. The newly proposed committee would be required to study and report to the Commerce Commission on certain issues, including interconnection timelines, cost-sharing between developers, and ways to create more transparency around the process. The Commerce Commission could then codify such concepts as binding rules and policies.

While the bill’s passage likely wouldn’t help projects meet the July 2026 construction-start deadline for federal tax credits, Collingsworth said it is important for the future of community solar in Illinois. Along with establishing the interconnection committee, the legislation would create a virtual power plant program, providing extra revenue to battery-equipped community solar projects that send power to the grid at times of peak demand.

“The tax credit is a key economic driver in Illinois, and without it, there is a much larger need for the incentives in the Illinois Shines program to fill the gaps,” said Nick Theisen, director of business development for TurningPoint Energy, which has more than 40 community solar projects built or in the works in Illinois, all in ComEd territory.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Nexamp-community-solar_2025-09-30-212937_mobc.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=98fdd3612c3c17840dcd5fbf001b6009,N,,2025-10-01 05:59:26.204337

Hindelang said Monday there’s no proof that public health impacts can be traced to EES Coke Battery emissions.","When faced with testimony that Zug Island’s EES Coke Battery is one of Michigan’s worst sulfur dioxide polluters, an attorney for the facility said Monday: “So what?” The DTE Energy-owned facility was “permitted to do so,” said Michael Hindelang, attorney for the utility and its subsidiaries that are defendants in the EPA’s Clean Air Act lawsuit over the emissions.

Hindelang and a U.S. attorney representing the EPA made their closing arguments Monday in a federal bench trial. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain said each party has until Oct. 9 to submit its findings of fact in the case.

The EPA requested that EES Coke Battery pay a $140 million civil penalty and begin operating with full desulfurization technology within three years.

Hindelang said a $5 million penalty should be assessed against EES Coke Battery, and the facility should continue reasonable environmental reporting requirements until otherwise directed by the state.

The court should decide whether it’s a civil fine or environmental mitigation funding, and the facility is willing to install pollution controls that would reduce at least 33% of sulfur dioxide emissions, he said.

The EPA is asking Drain to order the installation of full desulfurization, including the best available control technology with the lowest achievable emissions rate. EES Coke Battery produces coke, a raw material in the steelmaking process. The facility has contracts of one to five years in length to sell its product to Cleveland-Cliffs and ArcelorMittal, a DTE Vantage executive testified last week.

Drain ruled Aug. 25 that EES Coke Battery violated the Clean Air Act by making a major modification to its operations, instead of a minor modification as its 2014 permit allowed.

U.S. attorney Tom Benson said Monday that EES Coke Battery discovered that blast furnace gas was harming the battery, and chose to switch fuels and apply for a new Clean Air Act permit in 2014.

EPA lawyer on Zug Island pollution: ‘They buried their heads in the sand’

The U.S. government seeks to bring EES Coke Battery back into compliance and secure a penalty, Benson said Monday.

To follow the law, EES Coke Battery needs to obtain New Source Review permits from the state within 90 days, pay $140 million, and begin operating full desulfurization within three years, he said.

New Source Review is a Clean Air Act permitting program that requires facilities to install modern pollution controls when they build new plants or make major modifications.

“This is not a shutdown order. Defendants can afford to comply with the law and keep running the battery,” Benson said.

Hindelang said the government’s proposal amounts to a shutdown order — “a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” he said. The government is asking for an order EES Coke Battery cannot afford or physically accommodate, and it’s on an unfeasible timeline, Hindelang said.

“Benson is saying the quiet part loud: ‘clean up or shut down,’” he said.

EES Coke Battery can either clean up, by installing pollution controls that would cut at least 33% of sulfur dioxide emissions, or shut down, Hindelang said. The desulfurization technology the EPA proposes is “massively expensive” and would not fit on Zug Island, he said.

EES Coke Battery can afford a Claus reactor, a type of desulfurization technology, that could prevent future violations on the island, Hindelang said.

The Claus reactor is “good,” Hindelang said, but the government wants “great,” and “great is a shutdown order,” he said.

Benson said a 33% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions is “not a solution at all.” Referring to New Source Review permitting, the U.S. attorney said: “You can’t uncrack an egg.

“Once a major modification is done, the law steps in,” Benson said. “The Clean Air Act has spoken, and they have to install the best available control technology and lowest achievable emissions rate.”

Hindelang said EES Coke Battery made good faith efforts to comply with its permits, while Benson said the state never approved emissions increases that it did not know were occurring.

“Closing your eyes is a choice that brought us here today,” he said.

Clean Air Act penalties factor in the duration of a violation, which is seven years in this case, Benson said; prior payments, of which he said there are none; and the seriousness of the violation based on health impacts.

“They buried their heads in the sand and hoped the court wouldn’t notice. They already harmed thousands of people downwind,” Benson said.

“The community didn’t choose to roll the dice, but they lost nonetheless. Some had heart attacks, some died earlier than they should have.”

Hindelang said installing desulfurization technology takes six years, not the three the government is requesting, “if everything goes smoothly.”

Permitting would take two years, installation of desulfurization technology would take three, and engineering design would take more than a year, he said.

The waterfall effect of a shutdown order would include a loss of $450 million in economic output from EES Coke Battery, a $900 million overall loss to Michigan, and 2,700 job losses across the state, Hindelang said.

A shutdown order would eliminate the coke that supports the production of 2.5 million tons of steel a year, he said.

EPA, DTE on Zug Island facility’s public health impact

Twenty-six premature deaths, 3.8 nonfatal heart attacks, 8,000 acute respiratory symptom days, 14.5 new asthma cases, and additional Alzheimer’s cases are modeled to have occurred in 2019 due to sulfur dioxide and particulate matter pollution from the coke battery, an epidemiologist testified in federal court earlier in the trial.

Joel Schwartz, professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the social cost of pollution from EES Coke Battery from 2019-2022 totals $1 billion.

An air quality expert with 40 years of experience testified Sept. 17 that EES Coke Battery’s excess particulate matter emissions are “one of the largest sources I’ve ever seen.”

Pollution from the coke battery reached Maine, Missouri, and North Carolina’s coast, according to Lyle Chinkin, an air quality expert and CEO and chief scientist of Sonoma Technology.

Hindelang said Monday there’s no proof that public health impacts can be traced to EES Coke Battery emissions.

“We understand the concerns of the Sierra Club witnesses,” Hindelang said. Some of the witnesses called to testify were lifelong residents of 48217, the highly polluted zip code near Zug Island. Their stories of red-orange skies are from long before the coke battery opened, Hindelang said. The Sierra Club intervened in the lawsuit, which was filed by the EPA in 2022.

The biggest harm to public health occurs at EES Coke Battery’s fenceline and is from fugitive sources like door leaks — when a worker opens the oven door to shovel coal in — and there’s no technology to fix that, Hindelang said.

With the conclusion of construction, the facility is now positioned to accelerate North American battery supply.

The plant was built on schedule and without major incidents, according to company leadership. Moreover, the joint venture emphasized safety and thorough execution in each phase. With this milestone, the project now transitions into the commissioning and operational stages.

Project Factsheet: NextStar / ANC Battery Plant

Developer / Partners NextStar Energy (Stellantis + LG Energy Solution)

Project Type Large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing

Capacity approximately 49.5 GWh annually

Size approx. 4.23 million sq ft of facility footprint

Location Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Construction Duration Began August 2022, Completed September 2025

Workforce 3,200 trades & installation staff

Economic Impact Thousands of jobs; major boost to local EV supply chain

Strategic Significance & Market Context

With this plant complete, Canada secures its first large-scale domestic EV battery manufacturing facility. Indeed, NextStar’s facility will supply around 40 % of Stellantis’s electric vehicle needs in North America.

Furthermore, the project supports the auto industry’s shift toward electrification. As more automakers plan EV lineups, stable local battery supply reduces reliance on distant overseas sources. Hence, NextStar’s plant strengthens resilience in North American supply chains, much like the Louisiana EV battery plant that recently broke ground as a first-of-its-kind facility in the United States.

Teams, Timing & Execution

Construction of this facility began in August 2022 with site clearing and foundation work. Over succeeding years, the project advanced steadily, marked by topping-out ceremonies and structural milestones.

Project leadership reports that work proceeded with adherence to safety protocols and schedule benchmarks. As a result, the building envelope, mechanical systems, and installation phases were completed on time. Now, the transition is toward testing and startup.

The plant’s workforce included up to 3,200 trades and installers. Of these, a large share were local and Canadian, reinforcing regional industrial capacity.

Challenges & Mitigations

Although the project achieved completion, it faced typical risks: supply chain constraints, labor availability, and cost inflation. To mitigate these, the joint venture applied rigorous procurement protocols and phased staging. In addition, close coordination among Stellantis, LG, and contractors helped streamline operations.

Moreover, contingency planning allowed flexibility in schedule buffers. The project’s success underscores the value of proactive risk management in big-ticket EV infrastructure builds.

Next Steps & Outlook

With construction now done, the plant enters the commissioning and start-up phase. Over coming months, equipment will be tested, systems calibrated, and production ramped. Once operational, the plant will begin delivering modules and cells to EV assembly lines.

The broader implication is clear: this facility positions Windsor, and Canada, as a strategic hub for EV battery manufacturing.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA's job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

The company is developing similar 10-MW blocks for other potential Riley locations while operating a 5-MW facility for natural gas compression in West Texas.","Like its Gunsmoke namesake, Miss Kitty—a Plains, Texas behind-the-meter microgrid project—is tough, pragmatic, and distinctly Western. Faced with a hard ceiling on utility power and years-long waits in the interconnection queue, developers Conduit Power and Riley Exploration Permian turned stranded Permian gas into 24/7 electricity, bypassing the Texas grid’s bottlenecks and giving the project the reliability Riley needed to keep drilling and growing.

The Permian Basin’s paradox is that energy abundance often collides with infrastructure scarcity. Natural gas production exceeds pipeline and processing capacity, forcing producers to flare what they can’t move, while interconnection queues, which can stretch for years, bottleneck new loads and limit growth. But for independent oil and gas producer Riley Exploration Permian, that challenge became an opportunity through a collaboration with Conduit Power, a Houston-based commercial and industrial power firm. The companies transformed low-value, stranded gas into reliable onsite generation, creating an island microgrid that empowers drilling expansion. The approach exemplifies how infrastructure limitations can catalyze industry-leading sustainable solutions.

Conduit, founded in 2022 with backing from Grey Rock Investment Partners’ decarbonization fund, was built to resolve a fundamental problem: oil and gas operators often sit on low-value natural gas while transmission bottlenecks and diesel dependence limit their growth. “The fund that we’re tied into is a decarbonization fund, so [we focus on] legacy places where diesel is heavily utilized and convert that into more of a lower emissions type profile of the natural gas engines and work through ways that we can add value operationally,” explained Monet Maxwell, Conduit’s senior director of Asset Management. That mission has more recently taken into account speed-to-market imperatives, she noted. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)’s 2024 Permian Basin Reliability Plan, peak demand in the region is projected to rise from 3.4 GW in 2022 to 26.4 GW by 2038, mainly driven by oil and gas electrification and data center development.

For Riley, the dilemma has held high stakes. While its oilfield operations in Plains, Texas, required nearly 23,000 horsepower of load, only half to two-thirds of that capacity was consistently available. A utility contract capped expansion, leaving Riley unable to bring on new wells or pumps without breaching its limit. “They’ve got to plan their production around the power that they have in that area,” Maxwell said. Given the congested interconnected queues and hurdles constraining transmission expansion and land acquisition, “Being able to self-generate gave them fewer limitations on what that looks like for their growth profile,” she said.

In 2023, Riley established a 50-50 joint venture with Conduit Power to form RPC Power, an entity designed to own and operate dedicated generation assets. The partnership crystallized around Riley’s existing private-use network, a 25-kV overhead line system originally strung to individual wells, which became a backbone for a new model of behind-the-meter power. RPC’s first project, Miss Kitty, leveraged an ideal site adjacent to Stakeholder Midstream’s 30-30 Gas Treating and Processing Plant in Yoakum County. The completely islanded 20.8-MWe microgrid, completed in October 2024, has since become a flagship project for RPC Power.

Miss Kitty: Inside the Saloon

Miss Kitty comprises eight MTU 20V4000L64FNER reciprocating engines, each delivering 2.6 MW of nameplate output. The engines’ configuration optimizes reliability over maximum throughput, consuming approximately 1,500 to 1,600 thousand cubic feet (MCF) per day of natural gas to generate consistent industrial power for Riley’s operations, Maxwell said. The project’s fuel pathway also illustrates sophisticated integration with existing infrastructure. Natural gas from Riley’s wells flows to the nearby Stakeholder 30-30 processing plant, where it undergoes treatment to meet MTU’s stringent composition requirements. These include heating values between 8-11 kWh/m³, methane number stability within±5 MN/min, and heating value deviation of±5%. After processing, the gas returns at approximately 100 PSI through a dedicated pipeline equipped with emergency shutoffs, gas chromatography, knockout drums, and filtration systems. At the generation site, pressure drops to 3 PSI before combustion (Figure 1)

The electrical design evolved in two phases: Gen Site 1, brought online in April 2024, operates at 600 V with 600-V auxiliaries, and Gen Site 2, commissioned in October 2024, operates at 13.8 kV with 480-V auxiliaries. Both tie into Riley’s 24.9 kV private-use network, stepping up power via transformers and enabling seamless integration with field operations. Load sharing across eight units ensures dynamic response to pump and compressor demands, albeit with some frequency and rpm variability as engines adjust to real-time loads.

Conduit Power managed engineering and oversaw Summit Industrial as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. Although supply chain constraints delayed the planned 4.5-month site prep-to-commissioning, construction began in April 2023 and concluded in late 2024. Equipment shortages prompted a temporary turbine solution—initially an SMT 60, then a Taurus 60—running alongside two commissioned reciprocating engines. Mixed-generation load sharing, however, proved complex. “Because of their different sizes and different OEMs they were not able to load share together making the power plant control complicated,” Maxwell explained. However, the experience informed future deployment strategies and reinforced the value of standardized equipment selection for operational simplicity.

The project’s modular design also eased maintenance at the remote site. When a generator bearing failed, the entire skid-mounted unit was wheeled to the factory for repair. Maxwell noted that local workforce integration bolstered community impact. Contractors from Hobbs, New Mexico, two Plains-based operators, and an operations manager joined the project team. Permitting followed a swift Texas Commission on Environmental Quality standard pathway—3–4 weeks for air permits and concurrent Title V applications—far faster than ERCOT and SPP’s multi-year interconnection queues.

A Test of Grit: Reliability in the Field

Today, Miss Kitty’s operational performance demonstrates the viability of behind-the-meter natural gas generation for critical industrial applications. The facility has achieved 99.5% site availability and 98.5% power delivery reliability. The difference reflects gas composition issues and field-related interruptions—challenges inherent to operating in proximity to active gas processing facilities, Maxwell noted. “That is honestly one of the largest challenges we have right now, because we’re so close to the natural gas facility,” she explained. “If the natural gas plant has an issue, they’ll switch to the pipeline gas that’s in the area, and that can have a 10% deviation and composition, which is outside of the threshold of the engines.” Manual gas composition adjustments—five to seven per month—are required when fuel quality shifts mid-stream, she noted.

Still, the project operates with meaningful environmental benefits. Its 2024 operations generated a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, which stems from converting previously stranded gas into useful energy. The economic model, meanwhile, reflects the project’s dual value proposition of fixed cost leverage and operational flexibility. “Most of the costs are fixed, so as more load comes on, there is a reduction in the kWh cost,” Maxwell said. “This allows for operational flexibility as more load growth can be brought online.” In addition, the project has shown resilience during severe weather events, which has validated the concept of island operation.

RPC is now looking to further bolster these benefits with battery system integration designed to enable higher capacity utilization while maintaining reliability standards. Engineering is underway to add BYD Cube Pro battery storage—two 1,089-kW containers per phase, totaling 4,356 kilowatt-hours of storage capacity—across both sites. “Right now, we’re maintaining it by having a lower load,” Maxwell said. The next step is to increase the amount of load in the area while maintaining the same sort of reliability and resiliency that we have in place. By adding the battery system, we’ll be able to run each individual engine at a higher rate, and if we have a single component failure, that load would be taken instantly by the battery and then distributed out across the engines that are running.”

Maxwell added that the project’s underlying electrical backbone has been equally important in enabling growth. “The private use network has given us so much flexibility,” she said. “As we’re bringing on more load, the switching that they’re able to do with the way that the network is set up has been really great in being able to grow this organically.”

For now, the project’s replicability extends across multiple market configurations and geographic regions. Built in two 10-MW phases, Miss Kitty established the modular block design that Conduit is now deploying elsewhere. The company is developing similar 10-MW blocks for other potential Riley locations while operating a 5-MW facility for natural gas compression in West Texas. Maxwell noted that these standardized units can be configured as behind-the-meter installations or merchant plants connected to ERCOT, demonstrating design flexibility across market structures. Current expansion includes three merchant sites under construction using the same engineering design, plus pre-engineering and permitting for a potential island-mode site for Riley in New Mexico.

But Miss Kitty’s legacy—like its iconic Gunsmoke namesake Miss Kitty Russell—will perhaps more prominently remain a model of pragmatism and resilience, distinguishing itself through the successful convergence of multiple industry trends into a single operational reality. The project’s name, derived from a nearby well, captures the frontier pragmatism driving distributed energy innovation across the Permian Basin: reliability without compromise and growth without waiting for the grid.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig1-saskpower-great-plains-power-station-moose-jaw-cmyk.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 03:58:55.851971

As a result, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain demand, which could lead to lower EV prices.

And the EV tax credit doesn't apply to all models.","Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1. But where prices go is less certain.

The tax credit, passed by the Biden administration in 2022 to support EVs, is going away Wednesday as part of President Donald Trump's broad spending and tax bill. The loss will cut into demand for EVs, which means prices in real terms will immediately rise - a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September.

That surge could result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year. As a result, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain demand, which could lead to lower EV prices. But it's not clear how much total savings the changes will provide, and likely won't make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn't respond to CNN's request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), more than three times as fast as the 2% for non-electric passenger vehicles.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% during the first six months, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

""If you already can't sell the vehicles at current prices, there's no way you are going to sell them at today's prices with this credit going by the wayside,"" he said.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms and cash-back offers for buyers.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

""I think we'll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,"" Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won't kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they'll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey reports that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment were all more important factors to buyers than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn't apply to all models. It's not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won't necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a ""moving target,"" said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

""I think there's going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,"" Green said.

The credits, which have been in place in various forms for more than a decade and were expanded in the Democrat-passed 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, were set to expire Tuesday under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed on July 4 and slashed hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits.

Until Tuesday, consumers received up to $7,500 for purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for a used one as a means of encouraging consumers to buy battery-powered vehicles rather than gas-powered cars.

“A key contributor to sales in recent months has been an increase in EV sales, as buyers rush to market before the $7,500 tax credits expire at the end of September,” Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, said in a statement.

Since taking office, Trump has moved to roll back policies and incentives that promote the electric vehicle industry, arguing they are costly and coercive. Trump has vowed to end the national “EV mandate,” which includes measures like emissions limits or requirements for automakers to produce a certain number of EVs.

“We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers,” Trump said in his inauguration speech. “In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.”

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in a statement that the tax credit was a “powerful demand signal” that helped move battery and mineral supply chains out of China and encouraged investment in U.S. battery production.

“The end of this credit removes one of the most effective levers we have seen in onshoring jobs, creating new economic opportunities for Americans, and making the United States more globally competitive,” he added.

Still, McDonald said, affordable EVs like the updated Nissan LEAF and Chevrolet Bolt will continue to be available at dealerships in the coming years.

“Between the end of the federal tax credit and shifting strategies from many automakers, 2026 in the U.S. is clearly going to be a down and transitional year for EV sales, but with dozens of compelling new EV coming to market in the next two years, 2027 should start the next growth phase for the rest of the decade,” McDonald said.

And buyers who purchased an EV before Tuesday have received some flexibility from the Internal Revenue Service.

In August, the IRS modified the phase-out of the electric vehicle tax credits, stating that if a consumer has a written binding contract in place and payment has been made on or before the expiration date, then the buyer may still claim the credit. That means buyers will be able to receive the tax credit even if the car is delivered after the Sept. 30 deadline.

The change could benefit automakers who cannot increase production quickly to meet demand. Under the new rules, they can continue building and selling qualifying vehicles after the deadline, as long as the contract was in place before the cutoff. The IRS has not set a specific deadline for when these vehicles must be delivered.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25217714107949.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-01 07:01:16.775852

Maryland opened the door Tuesday to a program that could fast-track energy projects through the state’s regulatory process in hopes of boosting the amount of power generated in the state.

For the next 30 days, the Public Service Commission will accept applications for large-scale power projects or “dispatchable” generation, which can provide energy quickly during periods of peak demand.

Selected applicants will get an expedited PSC review that could lead to a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity — a green light for construction — in 295 days, or nine to 10 months.

Lawmakers, utilities and energy companies are expected to watch the 30-day application window closely, with Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) at an event last week calling it a litmus test for the future of energy generation in Maryland.

“That will be very indicative as to what the market may look like for domestic generation here in Maryland,” Ferguson said. “We will learn a lot from that open auction to see what merchant generators will put forward.”

But few, if any, said they are expecting major new projects to enter the fray, such as a gas-fired power plant, in part because the new law does little to change the challenging economic conditions for the industry.

“It doesn’t change the fundamental economics of building a power plant, right?” said Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp. “And those economics are probably not good in Maryland, because we’re not near big sources of gas, like in Pennsylvania.”

Trump administration asks court to revoke Ocean City wind project approval

The expedited review is one part of the energy legislation, called the Next Generation Energy Act, developed by Democratic leadership and pushed through the General Assembly this year in response to high gas and electric bills, amid intense concern from consumers.

Leading lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) have said they believe that Maryland must generate more energy in-state in hopes of reducing consumers’ bills, as power demand is projected to soar in the 13-state electric grid that includes Maryland — chiefly because of artificial intelligence and data centers.

PSC Chairman Frederick H. Hoover said in a news release Tuesday that the fast-track procedure “provides a pathway to encourage new generation development and improve resource adequacy in Maryland without the State or ratepayers making a financial commitment.”

Moore said in June that he felt the Next Generation Energy Act “didn’t go far enough” to attract new power generation, calling on lawmakers to further incentivize nuclear power in particular. More recently, he has softened his tone.

“I do think the Next Generation [Act] that the General Assembly worked on and passed was an important piece of legislation,” Moore said. “And I do know that we are going to be working together, not just in this next upcoming session, but in this session going forward, to ensure greater relief for our ratepayers.”

Only certain types of power generators are eligible for the expedited review, under the Next Generation Energy Act.

One criterion is Effective Load Carrying Capacity, which measures a resource’s ability to contribute energy to the grid during peak demand periods. Projects seeking fast-track approval must have an ELCC rating at or above 65%, according to the most recent ratings developed by PJM Interconnection, the power grid operator for Maryland and 12 other states. And they also must have greenhouse gas emissions lower than coal or oil.

That list includes nuclear, various types of natural gas-fired power plants, offshore wind, steam and certain types of battery energy storage. The list excludes solar and onshore wind, among other power projects.

But all large-capacity projects — at least 20 megawatts — are eligible, so long as they have also applied to connect to the PJM grid.

Lapp, who represents utility ratepayers, has expressed skepticism that more in-state generation is needed, adding that planned transmission upgrades will ease some of the burden. He argues that most of the projected demand increase from data centers comes from outside Maryland, calling into question the need to impact Marylanders with power plant development.

Eligible projects currently in PJM’s queue include a large amount of solar projects coupled with battery storage, in addition to a gas plant upgrade, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, a coalition of utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage developers in the mid-Atlantic.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if there isn’t a lot of response to this procurement, because we know which projects would be reasonably positioned to respond to it, and I can say on behalf of my members that, generally speaking, the CPCN process has been relatively time-efficient,” Vaughan said. “Utility-scale solar developers are not seeing the CPCN process as the primary barrier to deployment in Maryland.”

Vaughan said some of his members may prefer to apply to a separate solicitation created by the General Assembly, for front-of-the-meter transmission energy storage devices, to be issued by January 2026.

And since state lawmakers gave final approval to the energy package in April, Ferguson noted, the market for renewable energy generators has changed, with passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminated substantial Biden-era tax credits for clean-energy projects.

“The evisceration of credits for renewable energy projects has changed the landscape dramatically,” Ferguson said.

Ferguson said that large renewable energy projects are in a “near-halt” position because of the new law, which may force the General Assembly to adjust its strategy.

“That’s something we’re going to have to take into consideration as we approach next session,” Ferguson said. “Now we’re working in a different financial landscape, where half of the energy projects that are the cheapest to build have been taken off the table.”

There could be a short-term increase in the pace of development, Vaughan said, as companies race to begin construction before July 4, 2026, when the tax credits lapse. It’s possible that some developers could try to use the fast-track before the PSC to try and meet that deadline, he said.

“This accelerated CPCN fast-track really could provide a make or break opportunity for those projects to get their CPCN if they feel that they’re at risk,” Vaughan said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/maryland_matters_articles_501/dd7ea51a92748f8e897002286e761df8,N,,2025-10-01 02:00:57.913522

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has the authority to set legal limits on contaminants in drinking water.
In April 2024, under the Biden administration, the EPA finalized national drinking water standards—known as Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)—for six PFAS.

Oxford Utilities anticipates that the second round of UCMR 5 testing will also reveal PFAS levels above MCLs.","For more than 100 years, the city of Oxford and Oxford Utilities have provided safe drinking water and that mission continues.

That is accomplished by being in compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Mississippi Department of Health, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of man-made chemicals that have been widely used in industrial and consumer products for decades due to their resistance to water, stains, and heat. They are commonly found in non-stick cookware; stain- and water-resistant fabrics, furniture, and carpeting; firefighting foam and gear; and even in personal items such as dental floss, deodorant, and toilet paper.

Because PFAS break down very slowly over time, they are found in air, dust, water, fish and soil both nationally and globally. Research suggests that they may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals. Approximately 80% or more of a person’s PFAS exposure comes from consumer products, while about 20% comes from drinking water.

Oxford Utilities does not produce or use PFAS in its water treatment processes.

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has the authority to set legal limits on contaminants in drinking water. In April 2024, under the Biden administration, the EPA finalized national drinking water standards—known as Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)—for six PFAS. The agency also introduced a Hazard Index for a mixture of five PFAS and gave water utilities until mid-2029 to comply with the new standards.

In May 2025, under the Trump administration, the EPA, announced major changes to those standards. While the MCLs for two PFAS —PFOA and PFOS — were maintained, the compliance deadline was extended to mid-2031. The agency also rescinded the MCLs for the other four PFAS and eliminated the Hazard Index.

What does this mean?

The original 2024 rule was stricter (six PFAS + hazard index, compliance by 2029). The 2025 changes scaled it back to just two PFAS, removed the hazard index and gave utilities two extra years (until 2031) to comply.

Debate continues over whether these changes can be made without a new rulemaking process. Regardless, Oxford Utilities is continuing preparations to ensure regulatory compliance.

More information about the EPA’s drinking water standards for PFAS can be found at: https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas.

Although the PFAS standards will not take effect until 2031, Oxford Utilities is proactively sharing information with customers about the EPA’s actions and the levels detected during required testing.

The EPA’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule requires most water utilities nationwide to test for suspected contaminants that do not yet have health-based standards under the SDWA. Data from these efforts helps the EPA determine which contaminants may require regulation in the future.

Under the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 5), utilities are required to test for 29 PFAS, as well as lithium, between 2023 and 2025.

In March 2025, Oxford Utilities was notified by the EPA to begin its first of two testing rounds. Results from the first round showed concentrations of PFOA and PFOS higher than the MCLs outlined in the EPA’s new 2031 standards.

Following these results, Oxford Utilities conducted independent testing of individual wells at the Anderson and Bramlett water plants. Elevated PFAS levels were confirmed at the Anderson plant, while levels near the MCLs were found at the Bramlett plant. The well at the Anderson plant with PFAS concentrations above MCLs was shut down immediately after confirmation.

Oxford Utilities anticipates that the second round of UCMR 5 testing will also reveal PFAS levels above MCLs. In preparation, the utility is consulting experts to replace water production from the Anderson plant and is evaluating the installation of a temporary well near the Bramlett facility to measure PFAS concentrations in a planned supply well.

Oxford Utilities is exploring the development of a new water source near mTrade Park. Testing will be conducted before investing in new wells and a treatment facility, and the utility is evaluating whether the timeline for this project can be accelerated.",https://oxfordeagle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2024/02/2.21-high-bills.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 02:00:50.002224

The initiative, unveiled by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the Global Citizen Festival alongside the United Nations General Assembly, forms part of the EU’s Global Gateway investment plan.

The investment targets regional power infrastructure and rural access to renewable electricity, with a view to strengthening Africa’s energy sovereignty and contributing to global climate goals. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewables investment could generate up to 38 million green jobs across the continent by 2030, reflecting both the scale of Africa’s demographic growth and the continent’s abundant natural resources.

The allocation of funds spans diverse contexts. Côte d’Ivoire will receive €359.4 million to finance a high-voltage power project aimed at bolstering regional energy distribution, while Cameroon has been allocated €59.1 million to expand rural electrification. In Somalia, €45.5 million will support efforts to increase access to affordable renewable energy, and the Republic of Congo is set to receive €3.5 million to diversify electricity generation from solar, wind and hydropower sources.

Further allocations include €25.9 million for Lesotho under its Renewable Lesotho programme, designed to unlock potential in wind and hydro power, and €2 million for Ghana to establish groundwork for a solar park and facilitate regional energy trade. Madagascar has been assigned €33.2 million to extend rural electrification through mini-grids, while Mozambique will benefit from €13 million in support of a low-emission energy transition and greater private sector involvement.

Despite Africa’s vast renewable energy potential, challenges persist. More than 600 million people on the continent remain without access to electricity, particularly in rural areas. Experts note that financing models, infrastructure gaps, and the geopolitics of global energy partnerships influence how transitions are shaped. Scholars argue that narratives of Africa’s energy future must remain attuned to the continent’s diverse needs rather than projecting singular pathways rooted in external priorities.

Von der Leyen emphasised the significance of Africa’s choices for the global energy landscape, stating that the continent’s clean energy transition has implications for employment, growth, and climate stability worldwide. While the EU’s commitment reflects broader efforts to expand renewable deployment, African policymakers continue to stress the importance of ensuring that such partnerships align with regional development strategies, including the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

As Africa navigates the complexities of a just energy transition, the EU’s financial package represents both an opportunity and a test of how international collaboration can be mobilised without reinforcing dependency. The coming decade will determine how effectively such investments translate into tangible improvements in electrification, economic resilience, and climate adaptation across the continent.",https://southernafricantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0066.jpeg,N,,2025-10-01 02:57:49.586670

They're becoming an increasingly practical option for small and midsize businesses in Michigan. From delivery vans to fleet vehicles, EV adoption offers benefits like reduced fuel costs, lower maintenance needs, and a smaller environmental footprint. On top of that, state and federal tax incentives can help offset the up-front investment.

But taking advantage of these credits can be complex. If you're starting a business in Michigan and considering an electric vehicle for company use, here are six ways to ensure you're maximizing your benefits and staying compliant with Michigan and federal guidelines.

1. Understand the Federal EV Tax Credit for Commercial Use

The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a commercial clean vehicle credit that applies to businesses purchasing qualified EVs. For small business owners, this can mean up to $7,500 in federal tax credits per eligible vehicle, or more for heavy-duty models. Unlike consumer credit, the commercial credit is not subject to income caps or manufacturer restrictions.

To qualify, your business must use the vehicle primarily within the United States and must not purchase it for resale. The credit can be applied to either leased or purchased EVs, offering flexibility based on your financial strategy. It's also worth noting that leasing may allow you to benefit from the credit indirectly if the lessor passes the savings along. A strategic review of your transportation needs—paired with expert tax guidance—can help determine if the commercial EV credit makes financial sense for your business.

2. Take Advantage of Michigan-Specific Incentives

Michigan is one of the country's leaders in clean vehicle technology, and the state offers several programs designed to encourage EV adoption. While Michigan doesn't currently offer a state-level EV tax credit, businesses may be eligible for utility-based incentives, such as rebates for charging equipment or discounted electricity rates during off-peak hours.

It's a good idea to explore local initiatives available through your utility provider or regional economic development offices. These programs may provide financial support for the infrastructure needed to operate EVs efficiently, such as installing commercial charging stations.

Staying informed on Michigan-specific programs ensures you're stacking every possible benefit on top of the federal credit. As policies continue to evolve, a regular review of these opportunities can lead to substantial savings over time.

3. Work with a Michigan-Based Tax Adviser

Navigating both state and federal incentives can be challenging, especially when programs change or overlap. That's why it's essential to work with a local professional who understands Michigan's business landscape and tax environment. A Michigan EIN accountant can help you track eligibility, file the correct forms, and make sure your records support your claims.

Filing for EV-related credits often involves more than submitting a standard deduction. There may be manufacturer documentation, business use certifications, and timing requirements that must be followed precisely. Missing a single detail could delay or disqualify your credit.

To get reliable help, consider reaching out through this accountant directory and finding someone with experience supporting Michigan-based small businesses. The right advisor can make the difference between a missed opportunity and a strategic win.

4. Integrate EV Costs into Long-Term Financial Planning

Even with tax credits, EVs represent a significant up-front investment. To make the most of the switch, it's important to integrate EV-related costs—like vehicle purchases, charging stations, and maintenance savings—into your long-term business budget. Doing so helps you project ROI more accurately and identify funding needs before they become urgent.

For many businesses, transitioning to EVs is a multi-year process. Planning ahead allows you to align vehicle purchases with funding cycles or growth milestones, ensuring the move supports your larger business goals.

Having a solid financial model in place also helps justify the investment to partners or stakeholders. Showing how EV adoption fits into your business plan—complete with tax incentives and cost savings—can strengthen your case for expansion or financing.

5. Maintain Proper Documentation for IRS Compliance

To claim federal EV tax credits, you must maintain thorough documentation on each qualifying vehicle. This includes purchase receipts, manufacturer certificates, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and records showing how the vehicle is used in your business operations. The IRS may request these documents during a routine audit or if a credit is flagged for review.

Beyond federal requirements, keeping organized records helps support state or utility incentive claims as well. Some rebates or discounts require pre-approval, post-installation inspections, or follow-up documentation that must be submitted on time.

Maintaining strong documentation not only protects your business, but it also makes the filing process more efficient. If you're managing this alone or want help staying organized, a quick search for a ""reliable accountant near me"" can streamline everything from recordkeeping to credit application.

6. Explore Leasing Options and Secondary Market Benefits

Not every Michigan SMB needs to buy EVs outright to benefit from incentives. Leasing is a smart alternative, especially since the federal commercial clean vehicle credit can be claimed by the lessor. Some leasing companies pass these savings on to lessees in the form of lower monthly payments, reducing your initial investment.

Additionally, as more EVs enter the secondary market, there are growing opportunities to purchase used electric vehicles at lower prices. While used commercial EVs aren't currently eligible for federal credits, they may still offer cost savings on fuel, maintenance, and state-level benefits.

Leasing or buying a used EV also helps smaller businesses stay flexible. If you're still testing the viability of EVs for your fleet, starting small through these channels can provide value without locking you into long-term ownership costs.

Charging Toward a Smarter Future

Adopting electric vehicles is more than an environmental decision—it's a financial opportunity when done strategically. By leveraging federal and state incentives, working with a local adviser, and planning ahead, Michigan SMBs can navigate EV tax credits with confidence. With the right approach, you'll not only reduce your tax burden but also position your business at the forefront of a cleaner, more efficient future.",https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4624775/6-ways-michigan-smbs-can-navigate-ev-tax-credits.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 00:58:07.572041

Drivers have been rushing to snag electric vehicles this month. That's because a hefty tax credit for buying clean vehicles expires today. As NPR's Camila Domonoske reports, EV sales have been supercharged.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: The federal tax credit for electric vehicles is worth up to $7,500 or up to four grand on a used car, and it's available as a rebate at the time of purchase. The Republican tax and spend law this summer ended that credit on September 30. Anyone planning to buy an EV suddenly had a four-figure reason to hurry. Matt Jones is with the car buying site, TrueCar.

MATT JONES: Yeah. The past couple of weeks, even, like, in the past several days, EV sales have just exploded. It's been bonkers.

DOMONOSKE: The deadline is today. And to be more precise, buyers need to have a binding contract by midnight. It's OK if the actual car doesn't get delivered until later. The Tesla website has a countdown clock ticking away the seconds until the end of the day. Jeff Aiosa says his Mercedes dealership in Connecticut has been cleaned out of EVs as the deadline approaches.

JEFF AIOSA: I don't have any vehicles left that I could lease to someone that's interested in taking advantage of this incentive.

DOMONOSKE: The tax credit comes with strict eligibility requirements for purchased vehicles - things like where the car is built or making sure the buyer's income is not over a certain limit. But on leases, anything goes. Every leased EV can get it. That loophole outraged critics of this credit because rich people could benefit. And it also created huge demand for EV leases. Aiosa's got some cars he could sell without the tax credit, but everybody wants that discount. And after the tax credit goes away, EV sales, well, here's Aiosa's prediction.

AIOSA: It's kind of going off a cliff, right?

DOMONOSKE: All those people who raced to buy an EV early won't be buying one in, say, October. So just like the deadline inflated sales recently, it's going to deflate them in the weeks ahead. EV sales are still expected to grow long term. Tax credit or no, there's a market for a car that's fun to drive and never needs a fill-up. But that growth is projected to be slower than it would have been if the subsidy stuck around. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

That’s why we must cut red tape, foster a pro-energy economy, and pass commonsense legislation that strengthens our energy future.
The most tangible way we have done this was by passing the Working Families Tax Cut package.
It implements President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, serving as yet another example of “promises-made, promises-kept” from this administration and congressional Republicans.","WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, penned an op-ed in The Washington Times, blasting the Biden-Harris Administration for their egregious energy policies and outlining the energy wins included in the Working Families Tax Cuts bill that Republicans passed and President Trump signed into law earlier this year.

Read the op-ed, in part, from Rep. Pfluger below:

Energy fuels every aspect of modern life. It powers our homes, fuels our vehicles, and drives our innovation. From the most routine parts of our daily lives to the backbone of our economy, affordable and abundant energy is essential.

As the representative for America’s most prolific oil and gas producing region, I’ve seen firsthand the importance of policies that bolster American energy independence and dominance. Our region’s success is built on the hard work of energy workers, our unique resources, and the companies powering it all. Without these, American energy dominance is not possible. That’s why we must cut red tape, foster a pro-energy economy, and pass commonsense legislation that strengthens our energy future.

In stark contrast to these goals, the Biden-Harris Administration spent four years implementing disastrous energy policies that pandered to woke environmental extremists over the needs of everyday American families and workers. These policies drove up energy prices and led to a weakened electric grid that has jeopardized Americans’ safety and security. Thankfully, with President Donald Trump back in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, we’ve hit the ground running to reverse these catastrophic energy policies.

The most tangible way we have done this was by passing the Working Families Tax Cut package. This transformational legislation is a massive win for hardworking Texans back home in my state and all across the country.It supports a pro-growth, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-business, and pro-energy economy. It implements President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, serving as yet another example of “promises-made, promises-kept” from this administration and congressional Republicans.

“Partnering with Emerald Lake marks an important milestone for CORE,” said Randall Maddox, a co-founder and president of CORE. “We have found a partner that shares our vision and culture, exhibits complementary skills, and has vast contacts across vendors, customers, and top level staff that have already opened growth opportunities.”

The North American transformer market is set for steady growth as the grid adapts to new demands. According to the US Department of Energy, more than 70% of U.S. transformers are over 25 years old, which creates a clear replacement cycle. At the same time, the International Energy Agency expects electricity demand to climb nearly 20% by 2030, fueled by EV adoption, building electrification, and industrial load growth.

BloombergNEF and Wood Mackenzie both point to grid modernization and renewable integration as major drivers, with utilities expected to spend billions annually on upgrades. Together, these factors suggest the market will grow at roughly 4–5% CAGR through 2030.

“We are excited to partner with some of the most respected executives in the transformer industry,” said Dan Lukas, a managing partner of Emerald Lake. “CORE has built an impressive reputation as a mission-critical partner and product specialist for value added resellers, contractors, distributors, and renewable power developers.

A government shutdown can have wide-ranging impacts on our communities—from delays in federal services to uncertainty for federal workers, small businesses, and military families.

As your representative in Congress, my top priority is making sure you and your family have the resources and information you need to navigate this moment.

While many federal operations may pause, my Sacramento and Washington, D.C. offices will remain open and ready to assist you. If you need help with time-sensitive issues such as Social Security, Medicare, the IRS, veterans' benefits, immigration, or passports, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

I also encourage you to contact my office to share how the shutdown is affecting you or your family. Below, you’ll find answers to frequently asked questions about a potential government shutdown and what it could mean for you.

Why does the government shut down?

A government shutdown occurs when Congress is unable to pass the funding bills—known as appropriations—that keep federal agencies running into the next fiscal year, which begins on October 1. If no agreement is reached by 11:59 PM on September 30, 2025, a partial shutdown will begin at 12:01 AM ET on October 1. While some essential services continue during a shutdown, others may be disrupted or delayed.

What does a government shutdown mean for Sacramento County?

It’s difficult to fully quantify the immediate effects of a government shutdown on Sacramento County. Our Congressional District is home to nearly 5,000 federal employees. At this time, it remains unclear how many of these employees would be temporarily furloughed, required to work without pay, or subject to layoffs as part of Reduction in Force (RIF) initiatives by the Trump Administration.

What government services and programs are impacted during a government shutdown and what effect does this have on the public?

A government shutdown, whether partial or full, impacts a variety of services and programs. During the 2018-2019 partial shutdown, the Food and Drug Administration suspended routine inspections, increasing public health risks. The National Park Service stopped trash collection and road repairs, creating unsanitary conditions and unsafe roads, while some national parks and museums closed entirely. Additionally, over 86,000 immigration court hearings were canceled, exacerbating existing backlogs. The shutdown also threatened the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program in some states, putting low-income families and children at risk. These disruptions illustrate how shutdowns can detrimentally affect public services and society's most vulnerable members.

What government services and programs remain uninterrupted during a shutdown?

During a government shutdown, essential services related to national security and public safety, like inpatient and emergency medical care, air traffic control, law enforcement, border security, disaster aid, and power grid maintenance, continue, though they may face disruptions. For instance, during the 2018-2019 shutdown, air traffic controllers worked without pay, causing widespread delays and even a temporary halt(link is external) of incoming flights at LaGuardia airport. Services independent of annual appropriations bills, such as the U.S. Postal Service and programs like Social Security and Medicare, also continue, but may experience interruptions. For example, during the Fiscal Year 1996 shutdown, most Social Security Administration staff were initially furloughed, leading to delays in services like public inquiries and benefit claims processing, even though Social Security benefits remained funded.

What happens to federal employees during a shutdown?

Federal employees from shut-down agencies are either furloughed—prohibited from work and unpaid—or required to work without pay if their roles are deemed essential to public safety. While Congress has traditionally approved retroactive payment for these employees once the government reopens, this does not prevent the immediate financial difficulties they face.

Following the 2019 Shutdown, Congress passed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which provides immediate retroactive back pay to federal employees after a shutdown ends. During the 2018-2019 partial government shutdown, around 2 million people were employed by the federal government; 380,000 of them were furloughed and 420,000 worked without pay. Many delayed mortgage or credit card payments, risking late fees or loan defaults. In 2013, there were over 2 million federal employees, with about 850,000 furloughed during the shutdown. Government contractors, unlike direct federal employees, typically do not receive back pay after shutdowns. In the 2018-2019 shutdown, it's estimated that 4.1 million people worked under government contracts, though the exact number of those furloughed is unclear.

At this time, it remains unclear how many of federal employees would be temporarily furloughed, required to work without pay, or subject to layoffs as part of Reduction in Force (RIF) initiatives by the Trump Administration.

What is the process to end a government shutdown, and can the President unilaterally end it?

To end a government shutdown, Congress needs to pass, and the President must sign appropriations bills to fund the departments and agencies that have been shut down. The President does not have the power to end a shutdown unilaterally. The funding bills follow the same legislative process as any other bill, requiring approval from both the House and Senate before the President can sign them into law.

What is the impact of a government shutdown on the public and the U.S. economy?

Shutdowns are detrimental to both the public, who face service and program disruptions, and federal employees, who are either furloughed or required to work without pay. Moreover, they pose a significant strain on government resources. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies need to develop and implement shutdown plans, a process that requires substantial staff time and resources, potentially detracting from public services. Shutdowns also cause revenue losses, such as those from visitor fees or gift store sales when national parks close. Additionally, shutdowns negatively impact the economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimated(link is external) that the 2018-2019 shutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, mainly due to federal workers reducing their spending in response to lost pay. Notably, this decrease in spending may not rebound even after workers receive their back pay.

Which federal facilities will be impacted by this government shutdown?

Among others, the following federal facilities may be affected in the event of a government shutdown:

Military bases, arsenals, depots, and federal armories

Veterans’ Affairs medical facilities

Federal prisons and courthouses

National laboratories

National Park System facilities, National Forests, and other federally owned or managed lands

Ports including seaports, airports, and intermodal terminals that may host federal customs processing facilities or law enforcement

IRS facilities

Law enforcement agencies like the FBI, ATF, DEA, or CBP

General federal office buildings

What happens if I have an issue with a federal agency during the shutdown?

My office will remain open and continue processing federal agency casework. Please note that some agencies may be slower to respond due to furloughs and staffing shortages.

If you need assistance with a federal agency, please call my office at (916) 635-0505 or send us an email. My staff and I are here to help open a case on your behalf. See here for more details.

I have a trip planned to DC, will tours still operate?

During a government shutdown, all tours of federal sites will be suspended. This includes the Smithsonian Museums, the U.S. Capitol, the White House, FBI Headquarters, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and the U.S. Botanic Garden.

If you previously booked a tour through our office, a member of my team will reach out to reschedule your tour once normal operations resume.

Will my travel plans be impacted?

Many TSA and FAA employees are classified as essential workers and will continue typical operations. However, due to staffing shortages caused by furloughs, air travelers should anticipate longer wait times, delays, and possible cancellations. We encourage everyone to exercise patience and kindness with these employees, many of whom are continuing to serve the public without pay.

Visa and passport services are not expected to be directly affected by a government shutdown, as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs are primarily funded through processing fees. However, if a funding shortfall were to occur, these agencies could experience disruptions in operations.

Will I still receive my SNAP or WIC benefits?

SNAP benefits are considered mandatory spending by the federal government, which means they continue even if the government shuts down. You should expect to keep receiving your benefits during a shutdown. However, if a shutdown exceeds 30 days, there could be potential disruption to the program. At this time of writing, it is unclear how the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would address extended funding needs.

Unfortunately, during a government shutdown, funding for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program will quickly run out, leaving many families and children who rely on this vital support without access to federal assistance.

How will my Medicare & Medicaid benefits be affected?

Medicare and Medicaid payments will continue as normal. However, routine interactions with the agencies may take longer if staffing levels are reduced.

I’m a veteran, will I still be receiving my benefits?

The Department of Veterans Affairs will continue to provide health care services, and benefits will still be processed and delivered. This includes compensation, pension, education, housing, suicide prevention programs, homelessness services, caregiver support, and primary call center operations.

Student Loan Payments

Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans should continue to be obligated and disbursed during a federal shutdown, but only as long as carryover and mandatory appropriations last. The department staff needed to carry out these functions are significantly reduced during a shutdown. Free Applications for Student Aid (FAFSA), Pell Grant, and Federal Direct Student Loans, and servicing of federal student loans should continue for a “very limited time” under a shutdown. If a shutdown continues for an extended period of time, school districts, colleges, and universities may begin to experience funding shortages due to lapsed federal funding.",https://bera.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 02:00:45.660341

Data from the Solar Energy Industries Association shows the country generated over 750,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity from solar and wind last year. That's enough to power more than 70 million homes.

The industry is facing changes, however, from President Donald Trump's new federal tax and spending policies. Some for the better, some for the worse.

Trump signed what he calls “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July.

Part of that bill changed policies and placed restrictions on energy tax credits for the solar energy industry and its customers.

The Solar Energy Industries Association said the industry will no longer have access to an investment and production tax credit after 2027 under the new law.

These two credits are financial incentives to encourage clean energy investment and innovation.

It might be a shock to some, but Vice President and Director of Sales for N.C. Solar Now Jesse Solomon said he’s witnessed funding cuts before.

“We’ve seen a lot of turbulence over the past 15 years, and we’ve always been able to adapt. Right?” Solomon said. “We’ve lost the state tax credit in 2015, and then we’ve lost some of our metering subsidies as well. But we’ve always been able to overcome that adversity up to this point.”

The residential clean energy credit is also at risk and will be cut at the end of the year.

This non-refundable tax incentive is for homeowners who installed systems, such as solar panels, batteries and geothermal heat pumps.

The association said this credit allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the system’s cost from their taxes.

But Solomon said with North Carolina’s population growth and the demand for power increasing, the solar industry will continue to boom.

“You know, there are data centers that are going to be built here over the next five years, and we’re in a perfect situation to provide functional power and reliable energy to the grid as well as the centers,” Solomon said.

Solomon said one thing is for sure — solar energy isn’t going anywhere.

“I think because the price of power just continues to rise, and as it does, you know, our business allows people to hedge themselves against that power price increase each year,” he explained. “So, we’ll continue to see demand.”

Solomon said N.C. Solar Now is a small, privately owned business with about 100 employees.

He says they are “working hard to minimize any layoffs and are cautiously optimistic.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/nc_solar_now,N,,2025-10-01 02:58:11.077789

The elimination of a $7,500 consumer tax credit and softening of emissions rules will sharply curtail EV demand in the US, according to Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley. He predicted the share of zero-emission vehicles — currently around 10% of the domestic market — could fall by half.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” he said Tuesday in a speech in Detroit at a conference Ford is hosting on blue-collar jobs. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

The blunt assessment underscored the rapidly changing dynamics for the auto industry under Trump, with many major manufacturers delaying EV production plans and redeploying investment dollars to internal-combustion-engine and hybrid vehicles. Ford has emphasized consumer choice in fuel types while shifting its EV strategy to one around lower-cost vehicles.

Ford’s electric vehicle unit, Model-e, lost about $1.3 billion in the second quarter and the company has forecast that it could lose as much as $5.5 billion on EVs this year. Its US EV sales plunged 31% in the quarter, hurt by aging models and a temporary halt in sales of the electric Mustang Mach-e due to a safety recall.

Farley on Tuesday said he sees more opportunity in “partial electrification,” such as gas-electric hybrids. He believes pure EVs are best suited for commuter vehicles that make “short runs” and account for only 5% to 7% of the market.

He said Ford is looking to add hybrid production to its battery and EV plants.

“We have to make these partial electric vehicles in the factories that would have been EVs,” Farley said. “What do we do with all these battery plants? And we will fill them, but it will be more stress” because of policy changes from the Trump administration.

What's happening?

Canary Media reported on a court motion filed by the Department of the Interior, which asked a district judge to cancel approval for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project.

The project, slated to be the state's first offshore wind farm, was approved by the Biden administration, but Interior Department lawyers argued that approval was given erroneously and didn't properly account for the project's impact on other activities in that part of the ocean.

Developers purchased a lease for the area in 2014, and the 114-turbine farm was expected to power more than 700,000 homes, according to the news outlet.

But even before this court battle, the project was facing an uphill battle.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, it moved the end date for wind turbine tax credits way up, only making projects eligible if they begin construction before July 2026 or get placed in service by the end of 2027. This wind farm is unlikely to meet the former date, making it challenging to meet the latter date as well. That means it likely wouldn't be able to offset 30% of its costs, potentially making it financially unviable.

Why is this concerning?

This farm is just one of many wind projects on the chopping block as the Trump administration prioritizes fossil fuels over many clean energy sources, such as wind and solar.

In August, the Department of Transportation announced it would cancel $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects. In New Jersey and elsewhere on the East Coast, several proposed wind farms likely won't come to fruition — or have at least been challenged. In New Hampshire, a new law restructured the state's energy office, putting less of a focus on wind projects.

These moves all mean less renewable energy produced for millions of Americans and that energy prices will likely continue to rise as utilities put more focus on dirty fuel sources — which come with the added cost of impacts from heat-trapping pollution.

What can I do about this?

It's not just commercial tax credits that will expire soon. Many federal tax credits for eco-friendly home upgrades — which reduce energy bills and environmental impacts — are also on the chopping block. This means that now is the best time to act and lock in savings before they're gone.

The federal tax credit for electric vehicles isn't available as of Oct. 1. The tax credit for residential solar systems expires at the end of this year, meaning solar panel projects must be underway by then.

Fortunately, other federal, state, or utility incentives will continue, including rebates for energy-efficient appliances such as heat pumps.

Meanwhile, those with opinions about government actions on renewable energy can voice their perspectives to elected representatives.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/21N6fghjsGZG9_zU82SK0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/f43e4d91cc9f1be725821f29e8491220,N,,2025-09-30 23:58:58.914083

Further, the Illinois Environmental Council projects the recent federal action that revokes clean energy incentives, cancels permits, and adds barriers for clean energy will increase Illinois household energy costs by an additional $400 per year and commercial and industrial power costs by 21%, underscoring the need for state-level action to reduce costs.

Numerous studies and real-world examples from other states demonstrate that provisions in CRGA will provide both immediate and long-term energy savings for Illinois.

Energy bills for Illinois businesses and families have skyrocketed this summer – as much as $46 per month for the average Ameren homeowner – because the state does not have enough electricity supply to meet demand. Without action from state leaders, energy prices for businesses and families will climb higher year after year, as recent energy auctions set energy supply prices at another record high for 2026.

Further, the Illinois Environmental Council projects the recent federal action that revokes clean energy incentives, cancels permits, and adds barriers for clean energy will increase Illinois household energy costs by an additional $400 per year and commercial and industrial power costs by 21%, underscoring the need for state-level action to reduce costs. In a time when over 1 in 3 people have sacrificed needs such as food or medicine to pay an energy bill, lawmakers must immediately provide relief to residents before power costs increase further.

How CRGA Will Help:

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will save consumers $34 billion. It reduces costs by increasing energy supply in the near- and long-term.

CRGA will expand Illinois’ energy supply by supporting development of energy storage, which absorbs excess electricity when prices are low to deliver it when demand and costs are higher.

CRGA would also create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program to deliver immediate savings by aggregating power from already-built distributed energy sources at homes, businesses, organizations, and elsewhere, and sending that energy to the grid to bolster supply. A VPP can be established in as little as six months. VPPs and energy storage are proven solutions to lower energy costs:

CRGA creates $34 billion in net savings on Illinois energy bills over 20 years, according to an analysis by The Power Bureau. This would mitigate the price spikes that have hit businesses and families hard this summer – and will again next summer.

The Illinois Power Agency projects that the CRGA would lower household energy bills by up to $20.54 by 2035 and its energy storage program would save two to four times its cost.

Energy storage, solar, and wind are by far the fastest and most affordable energy sources to build and activate – nearly three times less expensive and twice as fast as gas; three times faster than coal; and seven times faster than nuclear.

CRGA will save consumers money and prevent an economic disaster for Illinois by supporting the state’s growing clean energy economy. Illinois ranked fourth in the nation for solar energy growth in 2024 and sixth in the nation for total wind energy, but this impressive growth – and the jobs clean energy has created – is at risk.

If nothing changes, the Illinois Environmental Council projects this summer’s federal action will have sweeping economic impacts across the state, including:

52,000 lost clean energy and manufacturing jobs

$16.8 billion in lost public and private investments

105 facilities put at risk of closure

21% higher commercial and industrial energy bills, making Illinois a less attractive state for business investments

These devastating blows dealt by federal action can be softened through CRGA, which creates family-supporting clean energy jobs and helps lower bills through building energy capacity and optimizing existing energy infrastructure and policies.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will use proven solutions to counteract rising electric bills. It will save Illinois residents and businesses money now and in the future, and it will protect thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity put at risk by federal action.

Quotes from Experts and Advocates:Lesley McCain, Executive Director, Illinois Solar Energy and Storage Association: “Families and businesses across Illinois are struggling with higher energy costs, and the state is at risk of losing hundreds of small businesses and thousands of jobs. Illinois simply cannot afford to delay action. Lawmakers must pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act this veto session to protect our neighbors and economy.”

Andrew Linhares, Central Regional Senior Manager, Solar Energy Industries Association: “Illinois has long been a leader among the states in solar and storage deployment, and now is the time to build on that legacy by passing the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act this veto session. The Illinois grid’s reliability – and ratepayers’ electric bills – depend on it. Solar and storage and virtual power plants are the fastest, most cost-effective solutions to strengthen the grid and prevent costs from skyrocketing for years to come. Other states like Texas and California are embracing these commonsense technologies to help lower energy bills, and Illinois should too.”

Stephanie Burgos-Veras, Senior Manager of Equity Programs, Coalition for Community Solar Access: “Our most vulnerable neighbors rely on affordable, dependable energy, but the trend is headed in the wrong direction in Illinois. Community solar and storage benefit communities that cannot otherwise access clean energy. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will provide critical support for low-income communities by ensuring storage is deployed equitably across Illinois. The General Assembly must pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act this fall to protect our most in-need neighbors.”

Jeff Danielson, VP of Advocacy, Clean Grid Alliance: “Now is the opportunity for Illinois legislators to meet this critical moment with the tried-and-true policies we know will protect ratepayers, modernize the grid, and grow business opportunities up and down the state. Passing the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will provide consumers with significant relief and ensure our grid is stable, with cost-effective and quick-to-deploy technology.”

Samarth Medakkar, Policy Principal, Advanced Energy United: “After two decades of stability, Illinois is entering an era of fast-rising electricity demand. Meanwhile, federal government policies are worsening the supply crunch by making it harder to build the electricity resources that are cheapest and fastest to develop: wind, solar, and storage. While this is out of state lawmakers’ hands, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act allows Illinois’ leaders to signal to the advanced energy sectors that the state welcomes investments to prepare the grid by building more electricity supply and thereby lower costs for consumers.”

Katie Maloney, Deputy Director, Midwest State Affairs, American Clean Power Association: “To support consumers and economic growth amid skyrocketing electricity prices and rising demand, Illinois must invest in new energy resources. Energy storage systems deploy quickly and provide affordable, reliable power by better utilizing energy from existing generation sources. Illinois can lead in energy storage and gain cost and reliability benefits already seen across the nation. We must seize this opportunity to address infrastructure challenges while other resources are constrained—or risk losing our competitive edge.”

Kavi Chintham, of Vote Solar on behalf of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition: “While grid operators PJM and MISO are slow to connect cost-effective clean energy to the grid to help meet growing demand, and the Trump administration tries to bail out the fossil fuel industry at ratepayers’ expense, Illinois lawmakers can step up to the plate this fall and pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act. This legislation will protect families from utility bill spikes, preserve and grow our clean energy workforce, and maintain our leadership on climate action, regardless of regional and national upheaval.”

“Padua 1 is a major step forward for our utility and our community,” said Rudy Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy.
“It’s the first energy storage project as part of our diverse generation plan to come online, and it sets the tone for what’s ahead.","Texas public power utility CPS Energy on Sept. 30 announced the beginning of operations of Padua 1, a 50-megawatt, two-hour duration Battery Energy Storage System in Bexar County.

Padua 1, owned and operated by Eolian, L.P., was part of an RFP seeking 50 MW of battery storage that the utility launched in 2020. CPS Energy entered into a storage capacity agreement for Padua 1 with Eolian in 2023.

This project advances the utility’s Vision 2027 strategy, which emphasizes delivering reliable, resilient, and cleaner energy solutions to meet the needs of San Antonio’s growing population.

Padua 1 connects directly to the CPS Energy grid and is designed to charge during periods of excess electricity supply to provide capacity that would be readily available to deploy during the hours of highest system cost and needs.

""This added flexibility to both absorb and discharge electricity within seconds helps strengthen grid reliability, improves system operations during peak usage, and supports the integration of cleaner energy resources, especially during extreme weather and high energy demand days,"" CPS Energy noted.

“Padua 1 is a major step forward for our utility and our community,” said Rudy Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy. “It’s the first energy storage project as part of our diverse generation plan to come online, and it sets the tone for what’s ahead. Battery storage strengthens our ability to continue to serve our customers reliably now and in the future.”

“The overall Padua Grid battery energy storage complex, which will total 400 MW and nearly 2 GWh when completed in early 2026, will be the largest battery energy storage deployment in Texas when completed,” added Aaron Zubaty, CEO of Eolian. “Padua Grid was sited years ago at a critical substation adjacent to the JK Spruce and retiring Braunig power plants and was specifically designed to reduce overloads on key transmission lines serving San Antonio. Battery energy storage projects of this scale enable the efficient utilization of existing transmission resources and are the lowest-cost and fastest solution to meeting the nation’s strategic need to grow electricity production by allowing baseload power plants to operate better.”

The completion of Padua 1 follows CPS Energy’s 2024 announcement of agreements for an additional 350 MW of battery energy storage capacity, which includes Padua 2, a 150 MW 4-hour system, and Ferdinand, a 200 MW 4-hour system; both projects were also developed by Eolian. Padua 2, also located in Bexar County, is expected to be completed in Spring 2026.

As part of a related community benefits agreement, the project entities will contribute at least $175,000 each year to CPS Energy-sponsored activities and scholarships within the Greater San Antonio area for a five-year period once the projects are fully operational.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 02:01:39.696850

For car buyers and sellers alike, the final day of the federal EV tax credit was a busy one. At the Audi dealership in Oakland, general manager Daniel Kosset has spent decades in the business and thought he'd seen every kind of promotion.

""There's always the 'end of the month, best deal' kind of thing,"" said Kosset. ""But in 20 years of being in this business, I have never seen a run like this.""

The federal credit introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act, the incentive gave buyers $7,500 off new EVs and plug-in hybrids and $4,000 off used ones.

But earlier this year, the Trump administration's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" set in motion the end of the deal. The expiration date was September 30.

Kosset said a month ago, the dealership had about 75 electric vehicles on the lot. By deadline day, almost none remained.

""When incentives like this come out, once they leave, they almost never come back,"" he said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has confirmed there won't be a new rebate replacing the credit. That has Audi and other automakers reevaluating their sales strategies.

""Audi was really betting on 60% of their sales being EVs,"" Kosset said. ""That will bring adjusting. And there will be more gas units sold just for affordability.""

For buyers, Kosset's advice was clear: ""If you want an EV, get it now. It will definitely be cheaper to buy today than it will tomorrow.""

For anyone still trying to make the deadline, the requirement was simple: a signed agreement or payment in place before midnight.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/04/17/44c12ab7-fbb9-4746-b1e3-fac1544b84cf/thumbnail/1200x630/8784ed1e861fa390eb0c61a8f64c2f7f/ap23103735117275.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 21:59:46.220501

SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MAXN), a global leader in solar innovation and channels, together with its Preferred Partner, Chicago-based Hardt Electric, have announced a successful new solar energy installation to help power the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) headquarters in Glenview, Illinois.

CHEST's solar system is projected to generate approximately 341,000 kWh annually, offsetting nearly 30% of the facility's electricity use. That translates into avoiding about 242 metric tons of CO₂ emissions each year—the equivalent of taking 54 cars off the road, eliminating the burning of 27,000 gallons of gasoline, or planting 4,000 tree seedlings and growing them for a decade. Beyond reducing carbon, this shift lessens harmful pollutants that contribute to asthma and other respiratory conditions, directly supporting CHEST's mission to advance lung health and improve air quality for the Chicagoland community.

""The solar installation at CHEST headquarters reflects our continued commitment to social responsibility and to advancing lung health,"" said Robert Musacchio, PhD, CEO of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST). ""By lessening our reliance on conventional energy sources, we are addressing one of the leading contributors to air pollution, which is closely linked to respiratory disease.""

Hardt Electric, serving as the project's EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) contractor, designed and installed a roof-mounted PV system tailored to CHEST's facility and energy goals, consisting of over 560 highly efficient and exceptionally reliable solar panels from renewable energy innovator Maxeon.

""Maxeon solar technology has been developed through over four decades of research and innovation, delivering industry-leading efficiency and durability,"" said Michael Hynes, Business Development Manager at Maxeon. ""Our panels capture more sun in low light conditions—creating more energy earlier in the morning, on cloudy days, and later in the evening. And Maxeon panels maintain their power advantage over time with the industry's lowest degradation rate. This technology allows Maxeon to have an industry-leading, 40-year warranty that important installations like CHEST can depend on to produce clean energy for decades.""

For Hardt Electric, the CHEST project represents more than a technical achievement—it reflects shared values. Both organizations are committed to sustainability, health, and building a cleaner future for communities in Chicago and beyond.

""CHEST is a leader in advocating for lung health, and this project demonstrates that their values extend beyond clinical care into environmental stewardship,"" said Peter Hardt, President of Hardt Electric. ""We're proud to deliver an energy solution that supports their mission, supports a healthy environment, and offers an R.O.I that will help this organization focus funding that advances pulmonary health.""

Reducing operational carbon emissions When it comes to reducing operational carbon emissions of AI data centers, there are many parallels with home energy-saving measures.
Engineers can take advantage of these variations by leveraging the flexibility of AI workloads and data center operations to maximize emissions reductions.
To help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of AI systems, she and her collaborators developed the Net Climate Impact Score.","In part 2 of our two-part series on generative artificial intelligence’s environmental impacts, MIT News explores some of the ways experts are working to reduce the technology’s carbon footprint.

The energy demands of generative AI are expected to continue increasing dramatically over the next decade.

For instance, an April 2025 report from the International Energy Agency predicts that the global electricity demand from data centers, which house the computing infrastructure to train and deploy AI models, will more than double by 2030, to around 945 terawatt-hours. While not all operations performed in a data center are AI-related, this total amount is slightly more than the energy consumption of Japan.

Moreover, an August 2025 analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing global carbon emissions by about 220 million tons. In comparison, driving a gas-powered car for 5,000 miles produces about 1 ton of carbon dioxide.

These statistics are staggering, but at the same time, scientists and engineers at MIT and around the world are studying innovations and interventions to mitigate AI’s ballooning carbon footprint, from boosting the efficiency of algorithms to rethinking the design of data centers.

Considering carbon emissions

Talk of reducing generative AI’s carbon footprint is typically centered on “operational carbon” — the emissions used by the powerful processors, known as GPUs, inside a data center. It often ignores “embodied carbon,” which are emissions created by building the data center in the first place, says Vijay Gadepally, senior scientist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, who leads research projects in the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center.

Constructing and retrofitting a data center, built from tons of steel and concrete and filled with air conditioning units, computing hardware, and miles of cable, consumes a huge amount of carbon. In fact, the environmental impact of building data centers is one reason companies like Meta and Google are exploring more sustainable building materials. (Cost is another factor.)

Plus, data centers are enormous buildings — the world’s largest, the China Telecomm-Inner Mongolia Information Park, engulfs roughly 10 million square feet — with about 10 to 50 times the energy density of a normal office building, Gadepally adds.

“The operational side is only part of the story. Some things we are working on to reduce operational emissions may lend themselves to reducing embodied carbon, too, but we need to do more on that front in the future,” he says.

Reducing operational carbon emissions

When it comes to reducing operational carbon emissions of AI data centers, there are many parallels with home energy-saving measures. For one, we can simply turn down the lights.

“Even if you have the worst lightbulbs in your house from an efficiency standpoint, turning them off or dimming them will always use less energy than leaving them running at full blast,” Gadepally says.

In the same fashion, research from the Supercomputing Center has shown that “turning down” the GPUs in a data center so they consume about three-tenths the energy has minimal impacts on the performance of AI models, while also making the hardware easier to cool.

Another strategy is to use less energy-intensive computing hardware.

Demanding generative AI workloads, such as training new reasoning models like GPT-5, usually need many GPUs working simultaneously. The Goldman Sachs analysis estimates that a state-of-the-art system could soon have as many as 576 connected GPUs operating at once.

But engineers can sometimes achieve similar results by reducing the precision of computing hardware, perhaps by switching to less powerful processors that have been tuned to handle a specific AI workload.

There are also measures that boost the efficiency of training power-hungry deep-learning models before they are deployed.

Gadepally’s group found that about half the electricity used for training an AI model is spent to get the last 2 or 3 percentage points in accuracy. Stopping the training process early can save a lot of that energy.

“There might be cases where 70 percent accuracy is good enough for one particular application, like a recommender system for e-commerce,” he says.

Researchers can also take advantage of efficiency-boosting measures.

For instance, a postdoc in the Supercomputing Center realized the group might run a thousand simulations during the training process to pick the two or three best AI models for their project.

By building a tool that allowed them to avoid about 80 percent of those wasted computing cycles, they dramatically reduced the energy demands of training with no reduction in model accuracy, Gadepally says.

Leveraging efficiency improvements

Constant innovation in computing hardware, such as denser arrays of transistors on semiconductor chips, is still enabling dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of AI models.

Even though energy efficiency improvements have been slowing for most chips since about 2005, the amount of computation that GPUs can do per joule of energy has been improving by 50 to 60 percent each year, says Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a principal investigator at MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy.

“The still-ongoing ‘Moore’s Law’ trend of getting more and more transistors on chip still matters for a lot of these AI systems, since running operations in parallel is still very valuable for improving efficiency,” says Thomspon.

Even more significant, his group’s research indicates that efficiency gains from new model architectures that can solve complex problems faster, consuming less energy to achieve the same or better results, is doubling every eight or nine months.

Thompson coined the term “negaflop” to describe this effect. The same way a “negawatt” represents electricity saved due to energy-saving measures, a “negaflop” is a computing operation that doesn’t need to be performed due to algorithmic improvements.

These could be things like “pruning” away unnecessary components of a neural network or employing compression techniques that enable users to do more with less computation.

“If you need to use a really powerful model today to complete your task, in just a few years, you might be able to use a significantly smaller model to do the same thing, which would carry much less environmental burden. Making these models more efficient is the single-most important thing you can do to reduce the environmental costs of AI,” Thompson says.

Maximizing energy savings

While reducing the overall energy use of AI algorithms and computing hardware will cut greenhouse gas emissions, not all energy is the same, Gadepally adds.

“The amount of carbon emissions in 1 kilowatt hour varies quite significantly, even just during the day, as well as over the month and year,” he says.

Engineers can take advantage of these variations by leveraging the flexibility of AI workloads and data center operations to maximize emissions reductions. For instance, some generative AI workloads don’t need to be performed in their entirety at the same time.

Splitting computing operations so some are performed later, when more of the electricity fed into the grid is from renewable sources like solar and wind, can go a long way toward reducing a data center’s carbon footprint, says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in the MIT Energy Initiative.

Deka and his team are also studying “smarter” data centers where the AI workloads of multiple companies using the same computing equipment are flexibly adjusted to improve energy efficiency.

“By looking at the system as a whole, our hope is to minimize energy use as well as dependence on fossil fuels, while still maintaining reliability standards for AI companies and users,” Deka says.

He and others at MITEI are building a flexibility model of a data center that considers the differing energy demands of training a deep-learning model versus deploying that model. Their hope is to uncover the best strategies for scheduling and streamlining computing operations to improve energy efficiency.

The researchers are also exploring the use of long-duration energy storage units at data centers, which store excess energy for times when it is needed.

With these systems in place, a data center could use stored energy that was generated by renewable sources during a high-demand period, or avoid the use of diesel backup generators if there are fluctuations in the grid.

“Long-duration energy storage could be a game-changer here because we can design operations that really change the emission mix of the system to rely more on renewable energy,” Deka says.

In addition, researchers at MIT and Princeton University are developing a software tool for investment planning in the power sector, called GenX, which could be used to help companies determine the ideal place to locate a data center to minimize environmental impacts and costs.

Location can have a big impact on reducing a data center’s carbon footprint. For instance, Meta operates a data center in Lulea, a city on the coast of northern Sweden where cooler temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed to cool computing hardware.

Thinking farther outside the box (way farther), some governments are even exploring the construction of data centers on the moon where they could potentially be operated with nearly all renewable energy.

AI-based solutions

Currently, the expansion of renewable energy generation here on Earth isn’t keeping pace with the rapid growth of AI, which is one major roadblock to reducing its carbon footprint, says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, a short-term lecturer, former Sloan Fellow, and former practice leader of climate and energy AI at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.

The local, state, and federal review processes required for a new renewable energy projects can take years.

Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are exploring the use of AI to speed up the process of connecting new renewable energy systems to the power grid.

For instance, a generative AI model could streamline interconnection studies that determine how a new project will impact the power grid, a step that often takes years to complete.

And when it comes to accelerating the development and implementation of clean energy technologies, AI could play a major role.

“Machine learning is great for tackling complex situations, and the electrical grid is said to be one of the largest and most complex machines in the world,” Turliuk adds.

For instance, AI could help optimize the prediction of solar and wind energy generation or identify ideal locations for new facilities.

It could also be used to perform predictive maintenance and fault detection for solar panels or other green energy infrastructure, or to monitor the capacity of transmission wires to maximize efficiency.

By helping researchers gather and analyze huge amounts of data, AI could also inform targeted policy interventions aimed at getting the biggest “bang for the buck” from areas such as renewable energy, Turliuk says.

To help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of AI systems, she and her collaborators developed the Net Climate Impact Score.

The score is a framework that can be used to help determine the net climate impact of AI projects, considering emissions and other environmental costs along with potential environmental benefits in the future.

At the end of the day, the most effective solutions will likely result from collaborations among companies, regulators, and researchers, with academia leading the way, Turliuk adds.

“Every day counts. We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense,” she says.",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202509/MIT_AI-Climate-01.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 21:59:42.004405

TXSE Group Inc. received formal SEC approval for the Texas Stock Exchange’s Form 1 registration, according to a statement released today. The Dallas-based exchange plans to launch trading as well as ETP and corporate listings in 2026.

The exchange said it has completed its proprietary order matching engine and exchange platform, incorporating hardware and software designed to deliver low-latency performance, flexibility, and scalability. TXSE will provide listing solutions for corporate issuers and ETP sponsors.

“Today’s approval marks a pivotal moment in our effort to build a world-class exchange rooted in alignment, transparency, and partnership with issuers and investors,” James H. Lee, founder and CEO of TXSE and its parent company TXSE Group, said in a statement. “Real competition for corporate listings in the United States has finally arrived.”

TXSE’s mission is to reverse the decades-long decline in the number of U.S. public companies by reducing the burden of going and staying public while maintaining quantitative standards, according to the release.

The exchange has led efforts for legislative and legal reforms to strengthen Texas’ business environment and establish the state as a jurisdiction for corporate headquarters, listings and exchange operators. TXSE will continue working with Texas leadership to advocate for issuers and investors on policy reform at state, federal and regulatory levels.

“The State of Texas has a long-term vision for driving economic growth, streamlining regulations, and building financial infrastructure as liquidity clusters shift to North Texas,” Lee said. “As the one and only national securities exchange built and headquartered in Texas, we are proud to have been the catalyst for the development of capital markets in our great state.”

The company’s leadership team brings combined U.S. capital markets and exchange operations experience spanning more than 800 years, according to the company. TXSE’s headquarters in Dallas opened last spring.

The exchange describes itself as the most well-capitalized equities exchange ever approved by the SEC. Founding investors include financial institutions, investment organizations, liquidity providers, and corporate executives, according to the release.

As Congress negotiates over funding, stakeholders in the chemical regulatory space will be watching closely — and planning for potential delays.","As Congress edges closer to another potential government shutdown, questions loom large about how federal agencies will manage critical regulatory responsibilities. For the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), even a short lapse in appropriations and critical staffing could have significant consequences for the implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

TSCA is built around statutory deadlines. For example, there are strict timelines for new chemical reviews under Section 5 and for ongoing risk evaluations and risk management rules under Section 6. EPA is also subject to several court ordered deadlines as a result of settled lawsuits. A shutdown would likely halt or at the least slow many of these activities, creating ripple effects that extend well beyond the duration of the funding lapse. Unlike discretionary programs, many of EPA’s core chemical safety functions cannot simply be paused without consequence.

Perhaps the most immediate impact would be on the processing of premanufacture notices (PMN) and other new chemical submissions under TSCA Section 5. EPA will stop reviewing all cases when it runs out of operating funds. While the Central Data Exchange (CDX) will remain open and cases can still be submitted, nothing will move forward until funding is restored and employees are back at their jobs. In prior shutdowns, EPA has issued Federal Register notices extending review periods, but even if review periods expire, it is highly unlikely fees would be refunded. Importantly, companies may not proceed to market until EPA’s review is complete. For readers seeking to calculate what damage a delay will cause, a useful rule of thumb is that however long the shutdown lasts, restarting EPA’s processes will take at least as long as the shutdown. If the shutdown is brief, a rule of thumb is to expect about half the time to get back to full strength. For example, a two-week shutdown could mean an additional week to restart normal operations as returning staff sift through backlogged e-mails as well as catching up on new submissions.

During past shutdowns, EPA furloughed most enforcement staff. For the chemical sector, this meant fewer inspections, reduced oversight, and uncertainty about how compliance obligations would be treated. While statutory requirements remain in force, a reduction in enforcement presence can create ambiguity for regulated entities and frustration for communities seeking accountability. Regulated entities should recognize that EPA can allege violations up to five years after an infraction and strive to comply with applicable regulations at all times.

The 2018–2019 shutdown provides a telling precedent, as the only other shutdown during the first Trump Administration, and the longest government shutdown in American history, for a total of 34 days. During that 34-day lapse, EPA’s chemical program ground to a near halt, creating a backlog that took months to resolve. Even shorter shutdowns have been disruptive, illustrating how quickly TSCA’s tight timelines can fall out of sync when staff are furloughed and processes are paused. The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) may be able to operate for some period of time past the funding lapse. Funding is likely limited, however, and if a shutdown is prolonged, EPA’s TSCA activities will likely cease.

States that administer their own chemical safety statutes or enforcement programs may continue operating, but without federal coordination causing the landscape to become uneven. This patchwork could exacerbate compliance challenges, particularly for companies that operate across multiple jurisdictions.

For chemical manufacturers, importers, and downstream users, shutdown-related delays can translate into lost time, higher costs, and competitive disadvantages. Companies awaiting EPA approvals may face production slowdowns or missed opportunities, while other stakeholders may raise concerns about stalled progress on addressing existing chemical risks.

The prospect of another government shutdown underscores a fundamental tension in TSCA implementation: industry and communities alike rely on timely, predictable regulatory decisions. When appropriations lapse, that certainty evaporates, leaving companies, regulators, and the public health community in limbo.

Dealers predict EV sales will plummet without subsidy

Ford and General Motors are racing to sign up car dealers for programs that would effectively extend the use of a $7,500 USD tax credit on leases of electric vehicles beyond the Tuesday expiration of the federal subsidy, according to dealers and documents.

Each company in recent days has rolled out programs to their retailers under which the automaker's financing arm would initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers' inventory by making down payments on them, according to dealers briefed on the previously unreported programs and documents from the companies.

Those down payments will qualify the lending arms for the federal $7,500 USD tax credit on those vehicles, according to the documents and dealers.

From there, dealers would offer leases on those cars to retail customers as usual for several more months, with the $7,500 subsidy factored into the lease rate.

The programs are aimed at softening the impact of the disappearance of the tax credit, which has been in place for more than 15 years to encourage EV adoption.

""We worked with our GM dealers on an extended offer for customers to benefit from the tax credit for leases of EVs,"" GM said in a statement to Reuters on Monday.

Ford said it was working to provide Ford EV customers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until December 31.

Dealers, auto executives and analysts have predicted that EV sales and leasing would plummet following Tuesday's expiration of the tax credit, after a rush on EVs in recent months from buyers seeking to beat the deadline.

U.S. President Donald Trump's massive tax bill, signed in July, set the September 30 end date for the subsidy.

It was unclear if other automakers were pursuing similar tactics to extend the period through which they can take advantage of the tax credit to sell their EVs.

Ford and GM devised their programs after discussions with officials at the Internal Revenue Service, according to three people familiar with the discussions. An IRS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In August, the IRS said vehicles must be purchased by September 30 to qualify for the $7,500 USD tax credit.

North Carolina’s population has trended urban for decades. From July 1, 2023, to July 1, 2024, the 14-county Charlotte metro area, which includes four counties in South Carolina, experienced a net gain of 57,300 residents through migration, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That represents an average of 157 people moving to the urban region every day, according to the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance.

Still, about 3.6 million people, or 36% of the state’s population resides in 78 rural counties, defined by trails only Texas among the 50 states. About 35% of the state’s population resides in 78 rural counties, defined by 250 or fewer people per square mile. North Carolina’s six urban counties (750 people or more per square mile) had about 75,000 more residents than 78 rural counterparts, as of 2020.

Most trailblazers also work behind the scenes to improve their communities. They coach youth sports teams, serve warm meals to the needy or help encourage young entrepreneurs. They believe that creating business opportunities in North Carolina’s smaller towns can make a big difference. ■

,Indiana and Evs,2025-09-30 22:37:58+00:00,Washington Examiner,DOT deputy slams regulatory 'coercion' boosting electric vehicles - Washington Examiner,David Zimmermann,,,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3830210/department-of-transportation-deputy-slams-regulatory-coercion-boosting-electric-vehicles/,"Bradbury, citing the Biden-era update to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, spoke on the current administration’s move away from mandatory clean fuel standards.
Under the Biden administration, the standards were changed to accommodate its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the mass adoption of EVs.
“We’re going to focus on what standards are actually realistic for internal combustion engines in gas-powered and diesel-powered vehicles,” he continued.
The credits for used and new clean vehicles were originally set to expire by the end of 2032.
“Automakers should be able to make [electric vehicles] if there’s demand in the market to support it, but we shouldn’t use regulation to force artificial changes in the market,” the DOT deputy said.","Bradbury, citing the Biden-era update to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, spoke on the current administration’s move away from mandatory clean fuel standards.

“In the previous administration, those standards were used as a regulatory lever, as coercion to force the auto industry to convert more of their production to all electric vehicles,” he said at a Politico event on transportation policy at Union Station in Washington, D.C. He added that the Department of Transportation believes the large-scale transition to EVs “is not consistent with what Congress intended for the fuel economy program.”

First enacted by Congress in 1975, the CAFE standards originally sought to regulate the amount of fuel consumption by gas-powered vehicles in order to make the nation’s vehicle fleet more efficient.

Under the Biden administration, the standards were changed to accommodate its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the mass adoption of EVs.

The CAFE regulations will still be enforced, Bradbury said, but they will be “reset” in a way that the standards are “actually realistic to be met” and more in line with Congress’s original intent.

“We’re going to focus on what standards are actually realistic for internal combustion engines in gas-powered and diesel-powered vehicles,” he continued. “This Congress made it clear we’re not supposed to take into account the fuel economy of electric vehicles or alternative fuel vehicles when we set those standards.”

In July, Congress passed the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act to roll back civil penalties for auto manufacturers that fail to meet some of the more stringent CAFE standards. The move encourages automakers to continue producing gas-powered cars and trucks.

The bill also sought to eliminate the green energy tax incentives for the purchase of EVs by Sept. 30. The credits for used and new clean vehicles were originally set to expire by the end of 2032.

“Automakers should be able to make [electric vehicles] if there’s demand in the market to support it, but we shouldn’t use regulation to force artificial changes in the market,” the DOT deputy said.

While not inherently opposed to EVs, the Trump administration is not prioritizing EV adoption. It’s instead focused on tapping into the nation’s natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, for more reliable energy.

Meanwhile, China is dominating 90% of the global production and supply of lithium-ion batteries for EVs.

When asked by Politico whether the United States is ceding the EV market to China, an executive in the oil refining industry said the U.S. should play to its strengths by focusing on natural resources.

“Let China do their thing. Since when does the United States follow China at anything? It makes no sense,” said Chet Thompson, president and CEO of American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.

He went on to say that federal subsidies are not the way to make the EV industry thrive.

“Why are we subsidizing wealthy Americans to buy EVs that they were going to buy anyways?” Thompson asked rhetorically. “The way to win this war [with China] is to have the best car.”

He also said new emissions standards should be set by the DOT and the Environmental Protection Agency, not individual states such as California.

TESLA OPPOSES EPA PROPOSAL TO RESCIND ENDANGERMENT FINDING ON GREENHOUSE GASES

Bradbury also spoke on the nation’s prior dependence on China for lithium-ion batteries and other technologies that require critical minerals, noting U.S. energy independence is a top priority.

“We are just so dependent on China,” he said, “and I think the president sees very clearly that this is a national security chokehold that China has over us in terms of dependency on these minerals to help support these new technologies.”","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP24124484237334.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-30 22:00:34.095095

The credit — a centerpiece of former President Joe Biden’s effort to get Americans into EVs — expires at midnight tonight after Republicans killed it in the “big beautiful” bill.
Analysts expect that EV sales will immediately fall and that a slower adoption curve will follow.
Many are paring down their EV offerings and emphasizing hybrids that reflect the customer mood.
Sticker shock The end of the tax credit means that carmakers will have no help in overcoming one of their biggest challenges: the yawning gap between the sticker price of EVs and conventional autos.","Today, somewhere in America, a car buyer will receive the last $7,500 electric vehicle discount from Uncle Sam.

While Washington sweats an imminent government shutdown, the EV tax credit faces its demise. The credit — a centerpiece of former President Joe Biden’s effort to get Americans into EVs — expires at midnight tonight after Republicans killed it in the “big beautiful” bill.

Now, the auto industry and the car-buying public will learn what a subsidy-free market looks like, for the first time since Washington started offering some kind of tax break for plug-in vehicles during the George W. Bush era. Will automakers build EVs if the government doesn’t encourage them? Will Americans buy them?

“We are going to get, in this Trump administration, a test of whether this technology — EVs and the infrastructure to go with it — really has a momentum of its own,” said Barry Rabe, a professor of environmental policy at the University of Michigan.

Booming — for now

On this side of the divide, EVs have flown off dealer lots in the last few months. As buyers rushed to claim the subsidy before it sunsets, electric vehicle sales rose 20 percent in the third quarter compared with last year, reaching a new record, according to Cox Automotive.

Meanwhile, the federal government is still funding EV-charging stations. At least 30 states will soon benefit from the Biden era’s $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, after the Trump administration acquiesced to a legal challenge and lifted its funding freeze.

But good times for EVs themselves may be at an end, at least for now.

Analysts expect that EV sales will immediately fall and that a slower adoption curve will follow. EVs will make up about 30 percent of car sales by 2030, instead of the previously expected 40 percent, the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation estimates.

Automakers seem to be bracing for a slowdown. Many are paring down their EV offerings and emphasizing hybrids that reflect the customer mood. Ram, for example, this month killed its planned electric truck, while continuing to develop a hybrid that pairs an electric drivetrain with a backup gasoline engine.

In Detroit, Ford CEO Jim Farley turned heads today by concluding that the end of the tax credit — combined with Republicans’ neutering of emissions credits — will cause the EV market to be “way smaller than we thought.”

According to Bloomberg, he said, “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5 percent.” At the moment, EVs’ share of the U.S. market stands at 10 percent.

Sticker shock

The end of the tax credit means that carmakers will have no help in overcoming one of their biggest challenges: the yawning gap between the sticker price of EVs and conventional autos. The average unsubsidized price of an EV in July was $57,246. That is $9,000 more than its gasoline-powered counterpart, according to Cox.

American automakers find themselves in a bind. They want to sell cars in China, Europe and other regions that are rapidly converting to electric vehicles, but their home market is tepid. They’ll need to figure out how to make Americans switch to EVs without a government sweetener.

“They can’t really take their foot off the pedal when it comes to building out new models,” said Robbie Orvis, an analyst at Energy Innovation, “because they will increasingly be pushed out of the international market.”

Trump threatens to fire ‘a lot’ of feds

President Donald Trump said he may fire “a lot” of federal employees if the government shuts down at midnight tonight, writes Robin Bravender.

The White House budget office has directed agencies to consider a reduction in force for employees in areas whose funding lapses and whose activities are “not consistent” with the president’s priorities. But details on the potential firings — and on agency shutdown plans — are scarce.

As Jennifer Yachnin writes, the Interior Department offered an email blast to employees today that largely focused on blaming Democrats for the imminent shutdown and offered nearly no details on potential furloughs or mass firings. (However, department employees “who process drilling permits and focus on oil and critical minerals” will stay on the job as essential workers, Ben Lefebvre writes.) The Department of Energy’s shutdown plan, meanwhile, dates from the Biden administration.

EPA has posted shutdown plans this week that involve furloughing nearly 90 percent of its employees, as Kevin Bogardus reports, but it’s still unclear whether they will be subject to layoffs.

Trump’s threat to fire feds appears to be an effort to pressure Democrats to sign off on a GOP short-term funding bill. Democrats are pushing for guardrails on White House spending and the renewal of soon-to-expire health care subsidies.

A renewable twist to ‘all of the above’

Democrats are borrowing a phrase from the Republican playbook as they try to pin rising energy costs on the GOP and Trump, Nico Portuondo writes.

“All of the above” is seen by some as a way to fight back against the Trump administration’s repeated attacks on wind and solar energy. But the phrase bears the weight of fossil fuels that other Democrats and environmental advocates are eager to discard.

“We have an energy crisis, electricity prices for homeowners and businesses have gone up over 20 percent in New Jersey,” Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) told Nico. “The only answer is all of the above.”

High stakes for AI hyperscalers

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has remained silent on a much-anticipated electricity regulation that would guide the way big tech companies power their data centers, Francisco “A.J.” Camacho reports.

Large tech companies building AI infrastructure have sought clearer federal guidelines for “co-locating” power plants with data centers — the warehouses of computers that Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among others, are building to generate new artificial intelligence models.

FERC is wrestling with electric reliability and consumer costs. Last fall, commissioners shot down a request from regional grid operator PJM to allow an Amazon data center in Pennsylvania to increase the power load it would take from the nearby Susquehanna nuclear plant.

Tim Tarpley, EWTC President, underscored the scale of the challenge ahead. Citing EIA projections, he noted that demand is rising across industrial, transportation, commercial and residential sectors—even as With U.S. LNG positioned as the supply bridge, Tarpley highlighted Secretary Wright’s recent call for 100 gigawatts of firm power capacity within five years—a requirement that renewables alone cannot meet. Natural gas-fired generation, he argued, must play the central role.

efficiency gains slow. “Power demand is going way up,” he said, framing it as a “huge opportunity” for North America, Europe, and Asia alike.

Texas, at the epicenter of both power growth and LNG infrastructure, is facing demand projections “off the charts.” But Tarpley stressed that delays in permitting pose the single greatest obstacle. “It takes over five years, sometimes six, to build a gas pipeline in the United States,” he said. “We can’t meet this demand without permitting reform.”

Policy hurdles: Permitting and tariffs

Tarpley detailed EWTC’s dual policy priorities:

Permitting reform—fixing and narrowing NEPA reviews, limiting judicial challenges, and accelerating approvals for critical infrastructure.

Trade and tariffs—addressing IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, which he said raise costs for U.S. manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers.

While both political parties broadly agree on the need for reform, Tarpley cautioned that partisan gridlock and election-year dynamics threaten progress. He noted that industry has only a short window—“really the next three months”—to advance permitting legislation before 2026 campaign pressures set in.

Strength in workforce numbers

EWTC President Molly Determan emphasized that none of these priorities can advance without a strong workforce. She reported that U.S. oilfield services employment stood at 628,000 jobs as of August 2025, but retirements continue to outpace new entrants, keeping skilled technical positions highly competitive.

Determan highlighted several workforce trends:

Workforce stability since 2023, supported by industry capital discipline.

State policy challenges, with restrictive states like California limiting growth potential.

Employer initiatives to improve retention and attraction, including flexible field scheduling, transparent succession planning, and empowering frontline supervisors in decision-making.

She also pointed to EWTC’s committee-led initiatives, from well servicing and stimulation to international trade and supply chain, where members are drafting guidelines and certification programs that “raise the bar” through self-regulation. The council’s international chapters in the Middle East and Latin America are increasingly providing platforms for suppliers to connect directly with E&P operators, strengthening global partnerships.

Bottom line

With AI-driven data center growth driving energy demand, EWTC leaders said natural gas-fired power generation is poised to meet the continuous needs. It's just a matter of whether the industry can overcome permitting delays, tariff burdens and workforce challenges, and build the necessary energy infrastructure. “Permitting reform and tariffs are our two biggest priorities,” Tarpley concluded, ""and the time to act is now.""",https://www.worldoil.com/media/5albf3rx/pipeline-stock-sunset.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 19:03:30.533737

You can still get significant rebates in some states.

If you qualify, you could save up to $7,500 of a new EV in some states.

The U.S. auto industry is approaching an inflection point. The Trump administration has killed the $7,500 federal clean vehicle credit, which had unlocked the rapid growth of electric vehicle sales nationwide over the past few years.

With the Sept. 30 end date in mind, buyers rushed to claim the credit in its final days, helping automakers sell a record 410,000 EVs in the third quarter, which accounted for 11% of overall sales, according to Cox Automotive. Now EVs will have to sell without the credit, and we’re about to find out what organic growth looks like.

However, a small number of U.S. states will continue to offer their own regional tax credits, rebates, and incentives, allowing their residents to continue offsetting the high cost of EVs compared to gasoline vehicles.

The number of states continuing to offer rebates as of Oct. 1 is really small, about 15. That's less than less than half of the country. California’s famous Clean Vehicle Rebate Project ended in 2023, and talks of reviving the same after the end of the federal tax credit have so far failed.

Other pro-EV states, such as Minnesota, Washington and Vermont have run out of funding for their local EV rebate programs. Some of these states may resume their rebates next year, but that’s uncertain and could require local legislative actions.

The states where EV rebate or tax credit allocation is not yet exhausted include New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Oregon, Illinois, Delaware,Colorado and a few others (See the complete list below). Similar to the federal tax credit, these states have specific eligibility criteria.

They mainly prioritize low- and moderate-income families. But the conditions also vary depending on tax liabilities, vehicle price, battery size, model year and, in some cases, even the gross vehicle weight rating and driving range.

No state will hand out a flat rebate for your battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle. Hence, the numbers listed below represent the maximum possible rebate or tax credit, as listed on the state government websites as of the time of writing. Note, too, that these rebates apply only to residents, so you can't just drive to another state with a rebate to score a deal.

Some states also cover the full or partial cost and installation of Level 2 home chargers, which is the preferred way of charging in the vast majority of the U.S. If the state governments don’t offer incentives on chargers, dozens of utility companies do.

So do your homework and claim all the possible rebates and discounts from the automaker, local governments and utility companies. Additionally, note that the incentives listed below are intended for individuals. Some state governments offer separate rebates to commercial fleets, businesses and multi-unit housing complexes.

And finally, states don’t have strict critical materials sourcing requirements for EV batteries, unlike the federal government, so even the Japanese-made Toyota bZ and the Belgian-made Volvo EX30 will likely qualify for the local programs. This is a plus, as it won’t limit your options to only the U.S.-made EVs. Click the hyperlinks below for eligibility requirements for each state.

Actions by the Energy and Interior departments and the Environmental Protection Agency follow executive orders Trump issued in April to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Environmental groups denounced the actions, which come as the Trump administration has clamped down on renewable energy, including freezing permits for offshore wind projects, ending clean energy tax credits and blocking wind and solar projects on federal lands.

Under Trump’s orders, the Energy Department has required fossil-fueled power plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep operating past their retirement dates to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. The latest announcement would allow those efforts to expand as a precaution against possible electricity shortfalls.

Trump also has directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands. A sweeping tax bill approved by Republicans and signed by Trump reduces royalty rates for coal mining from 12.5% to 7%, a significant decrease that officials said will help ensure U.S. coal producers can compete in global markets.

‘Mine, baby, mine’

The new law also mandates increased availability for coal mining on federal lands and streamlines federal reviews of coal leases.

“Everybody likes to say, ‘drill, baby, drill.’ I know that President Trump has another initiative for us, which is ‘mine, baby, mine,'” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at a news conference Monday at Interior headquarters. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Energy Undersecretary Wells Griffith also spoke at the event. All three agencies signed orders boosting coal.

“By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs,” Burgum said.

Zeldin called coal a reliable energy source that has supported American communities and economic growth for generations.

“Americans are suffering because the past administration attempted to apply heavy-handed regulations to coal and other forms of energy it deemed unfavorable,” he said.

Trump has clamped down on renewable energy

Environmental groups said Trump was wasting federal tax dollars by handing them to owners of the oldest, most expensive and dirtiest source of electricity.

“Subsidizing coal means propping up dirty, uncompetitive plants from last century — and saddling families with their high costs and pollution, said Ted Kelly, clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “We need modern, affordable clean energy solutions to power a modern economy, but the Trump administration wants to drag us back to a 1950s electric grid.”

Solar, wind and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to bring new power to the grid, Kelly and other advocates said. “It makes no sense to cut off your best, most affordable options while doubling down on the most expensive ones,” Kelly said.

EPA eases pollution rules

The EPA said Monday it will delay seven deadlines related to wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants. The industry has complained that regulations imposed under the Biden administration were costly and designed to speed the closure of coal plants.

Coal ash, the waste from burning coal, can leach into groundwater and spread toxins. The Biden administration said the rules were aimed at keeping arsenic and lead out of well water, lowering cancer rates and avoiding disastrous spills.

“Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways, with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food,” said Laurie Williams, who directs the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

The EPA also said it will open a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to a regional haze rule that has helped reduce pollution-fueled haze hanging over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations. Zeldin announced in March that the haze rule would be among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that he plans to roll back or eliminate, including a 2009 finding that climate change harms human health and the environment.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, an industry group, said the EPA rule changes and other administration actions would help to “protect America’s electric reliability and preserve its fleet of coal-fired power plants.”

Coal production has dropped steeply

Burgum, who also chairs Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, said the actions announced Monday, along with the tax law and previous presidential and secretarial orders, will ensure “abundant, affordable energy while reducing reliance on foreign sources of coal and minerals.”

The Republican president has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 15% in 2024, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.

Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there’s a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Coal-Mining.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 20:04:07.609150

Reform will “betray” every young person and future generations by waging a war on clean energy, Ed Miliband is expected to say.

The Energy Secretary will announce a host of initiatives aimed at bringing energy bills down and boosting green jobs during his speech at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool on Wednesday.

But he will also use his speech to attack Reform leaders who said they would “declare war” on green energy projects, which are being championed nationwide by the Labour Government.

It comes as Labour have been drawing battle lines at the conference to take on Reform, who they are trailing in the polls.

Mr Miliband is expected to say: “What is so exciting about clean energy is that it can answer that call for a different kind of economy … run for working people.

“It offers the biggest opportunity for job creation for decades. Skilled jobs in proud professions.

“And behind these statistics is the potential for each and every one of these jobs to change the lives of working people and their communities,” he will add.

“Reform would wreck everything we are doing. They’ve said they would ‘wage war’ on clean energy.

“Let’s spell out what this war means. A war on the workers at the Siemens wind turbine factory in Hull. A war on the construction workers building carbon capture and storage in Teesside. A war on the working people of Britain.

“Reform’s war on the future would betray every young person in our country and every person yet to be born.”

During his speech, the Energy Secretary will also announce the expansion of a scheme providing funding to install solar panels on schools and hospitals.

The initiative, led by Great British Energy, has seen around 200 schools and 200 NHS sites funded to have solar panels installed, with some starting to save money on their bills.

Its expansion will mean another 50 schools and 70 NHS sites will also get support, Mr Miliband will reveal.

Ahead of the speech, he said: “This is the common-sense, patriotic case for clean energy that you get with a Labour Government.

“Clean power cutting bills to help pupils and patients.

“This is the difference a Labour Government makes; fighting for working people through our clean energy mission.”

The Energy Secretary is also set to announce a new initiative to help cut bills for military sites and unveil details on the Government’s clean energy jobs plan, which will aim to double jobs in the sector from 430,000 to 830,000 by 2030.

Within this, the Government aims to boost engineering and research jobs by 25,000, welder and electrician jobs by 26,000, and construction jobs by 36,000, he will say.

Elsewhere, Mr Miliband is expected to launch a workers’ rights initiative, which will include the introduction of a fair work charter to ensure clean energy jobs are fairly paid with strong workers’ rights.

This will include plans to close loopholes that give offshore renewable energy workers fewer rights at work than oil and gas workers and ensure worker representation on the boards of publicly owned bodies like Great British Energy.

Currently, offshore renewable and low-carbon employees working more than 12 miles offshore are not covered by the national minimum wage, whereas offshore workers in oil and gas are covered in all territorial waters.

Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “Delivering lower bills through cheaper wind and solar is the best way to silence the likes of Reform UK.

“It is right for Miliband to call out these climate deniers bankrolled by fossil fuel interests for what they are – snake oil salespeople who want to keep us dependent on expensive imports and locked into high bills.

“The Government’s quest for lower energy bills for the public sector, households and businesses could and should go further by ending the rigged system that enables gas to set electricity prices. That way cheaper, more stable wind and solar can lower our bills for good.”

Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “It’s great news that even more NHS sites will get funding to install solar panels to help them cut their energy bills.

Valley Station Apartments are a 144-unit property put forward by Real Estate Equities on a 3.1-acre site at the southwest corner of 155th Street West and Gaslight Drive formerly owned by the Apple Valley Economic Development Authority. The units would spread across five floors and be affordable to residents making 60% of the area median income.

The council approved the project at its Sept. 25 meeting after receiving an update on the changes made to the project since a July informational hearing at the planning commission. Since then, the project moved from 148 units to 144 units, while the number of parking stalls increased from 240 stalls to 250.

Real Estate Equities also decreased the number of floors on the northeast corner of the building from five to four to “provide a smoother transition to the two-story townhomes in the east,” according to planning documents.

With the reduction in units, the density of the project moves from 48 units per acre to 46.45 units per acre, according to planning notes.

The project also appeared before the council with a handful of zoning amendments. One allows for a change in setbacks, another would allow for an increase in density and increase in building height and another allowed the project to have a flat roof.

The project will have 35 one-bedroom units, 72 two-bedroom units and 37 three-bedroom units. The rents for the property will be between $1,406 and $1,941, staff told the City Council. Blaine Barker of Real Estate Equities told the council during the meeting that the cost of parking will be included in the rent, which he said is not normally something Real Estate Equities does.

Amenities included in the project consist of a clubroom, an outdoor patio with grills, a fitness center, bike storage, electric car chargers and a dog park. It will also feature an indoor and outdoor playground that can be used by toddlers and families.

In July, during the informational meeting before the planning commission, commissioners and city staff expressed hesitancy around the height of the property. When asked by a commissioner at the time if fewer than five stories would be possible, Barker told the commission it wouldn’t be feasible.

A little farther to the north, Richfield also recently saw the approval of an affordable apartment development from JO Companies, which would feature an indoor playground as well.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Valley-Station-rendering.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 20:04:28.977457

NRDC will present PJM with a simple alternative: Starting in 2027, PJM ratepayers should stop buying capacity for new data centers.
Our proposal puts risk where it belongs—on the data centers that are driving the need for large amounts of new generation.
Thanks to this advantage, data centers can meet BYOC requirements by installing enough batteries to run their facility for about eight hours.
Instead, PJM should require data centers to make the investments they need to support themselves.","How we got here has been widely reported. To maintain a reliable grid, PJM arranges for power supply in advance. In July 2024, when PJM was securing capacity for June 2025 through May 2026, its markets were already growing tight and prices were poised to rise. Then, forecasts for data center growth shot up, raising costs by $9.3 billion. The trend continued in July of this year, when PJM purchased capacity for 2026–2027 and discovered that it will have the amount of supply it needs to keep the system reliable but with little to spare. PJM’s markets are designed so prices go up as supply gets tight, leading to the $16 billion bill for 2026–2027. Again, this increase was almost entirely due to forecasted data center expansion.

Where things go from here comes down to a race between data centers and new power supply. If data centers are built faster than power plants, prices will keep rising and reliability will be reduced. Reverse that, and prices go down. Right now, the race doesn’t even look close: PJM forecasts adding 5 to 7 gigawatts (GW) of data centers but only 2 to 3 GW of new supply every year from 2027 through 2032. And demand forecasts keep growing. Recently, PJM utilities doubled their forecasts of new large loads to 12 to 14 GW per year through 2032. Those new forecasts aren’t final yet, so this analysis still uses the current official forecast of 5 to 7 GW per year.

PJM must do better. We can protect affordability and improve grid reliability with the simple, commonsense approach that data centers should pay their own way. NRDC will present PJM with a simple alternative: Starting in 2027, PJM ratepayers should stop buying capacity for new data centers. Instead, data centers must bring their own capacity (BYOC). This could include new generation, resources such as battery storage, or demand response. NRDC estimates that with this approach, capacity costs will fall to $7 billion annually by 2030, with a total bill of $60 billion through 2032.

Power plant owners argue that prices need to remain high to provide a signal to build new power plants. This ignores the basic fact that there are huge barriers to new entry in PJM. Since new supply won’t be available for many years, high prices only serve to enrich the incumbent generators. Our proposal does not blunt needed economic signals but rather limits the deadweight loss from supply being unable to react to demand.

Our proposal puts risk where it belongs—on the data centers that are driving the need for large amounts of new generation. Data centers and utilities currently have little incentive to correctly forecast their needs, since any over-forecasting risk is paid for by the public. Once data centers have to BYOC, the forecast problem disappears entirely: Data center developers who need more power would have to build it without exposing anyone but themselves to the risk of unnecessary investment.

Data centers that don’t BYOC could still connect to the grid but might not be guaranteed power when supply is tight. Given the breakneck pace of data center demand, this is unavoidable. On the current path, PJM will have more demand than supply at some point in the next few years. That means that on challenging days (mostly during winter storms and summer heat waves), power cuts may be necessary. PJM understands this. It’s not a feature of our proposal; it’s a consequence of the laws of physics. Our proposal doesn’t change that reality—we wish it could—but it clarifies exactly how much power is at risk. Since states are ultimately in charge of deciding who gets shut off during emergencies, our proposal will let states plan in advance, helping them decide fairly if supply should be cut to data centers or the general public.

The BYOC concept not only protects regular consumers from rate hikes but also creates incentives for data center flexibility and gives them a clear and potentially fast path to firm service. The “capacity” in BYOC isn’t limited to new large power plants, which take years to construct. It also includes demand response programs that reduce energy during times when the grid is stressed; fast-to-construct distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar and batteries located closer to end-use customers; and imported power from neighboring power grids. Flexibility—the ability to reduce consumption at key times—could allow the grid to support many more data centers quickly. Under our proposal, data centers can monetize their flexibility by providing demand response to PJM, partially or fully satisfying their BYOC requirements at the same time. The proposal also opens the door to creative solutions: Data center owners could build new transmission lines to bring in power from other regions or fund energy efficiency in homes to free up power for their own use.

DERs, especially battery storage, can quickly meet data center needs while transforming PJM’s grid for the better. DERs have a critical advantage: They don’t have to go through PJM’s multiyear process to connect to the grid, so they can come online quickly enough to keep pace with data center construction. Using DERs, data centers could receive firm power supply three to five years sooner than building new gas-fired generation at a net cost that’s as little as 20–30 percent higher. Since DERs are still connected to a larger grid, battery storage would be used to support the overall system, not run the data center directly. Thanks to this advantage, data centers can meet BYOC requirements by installing enough batteries to run their facility for about eight hours. Most important, storage is a critical component of a low-carbon grid. If data centers build storage now, they create a clear path to zero-carbon energy for themselves and for substantial carbon reductions and reliability benefits for PJM as a whole.

The choice is clear: Ratepayers are on a path to spend more than $100 billion, unjustly enriching owners of old power plants while still facing blackouts, and not getting a system that supports new data centers. Instead, PJM should require data centers to make the investments they need to support themselves. This will discipline speculation, save the public vast amounts of money, and ultimately improve reliability for the data centers that need it while rewarding the ones that can be flexible.

Governor Shapiro called 2025 capacity prices “the largest unjust wealth transfer in the history of U.S. energy markets.” If we don’t reform how PJM supports new data centers, that will unfortunately be just the beginning.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-09/data-center-berwick-pennsylvania-25160495945570-rm.jpg?h=5da5b092&itok=gCuxmf7V,N,,2025-09-30 19:02:28.923349

At a high level, EPA’s proposed rule seeks to:

• Extend the deadline for existing steam electric power plants to assess potential compliance pathways for their continued operations by six years, from December 31, 2025, to December 31, 2031;

• Extend the compliance deadlines related to zero-discharge limitations for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater, bottom ash transport water (BATW), and combustion residual leachate (CRL) by five years, from December 31, 2029, to December 31, 2034;

• For indirect dischargers of FGDW, BATW, and CRL, EPA's proposed tiered standards would give indirect dischargers flexibility to meet zero discharge requirements on timelines matching those for direct dischargers;

• Update provisions to allow facilities to transfer between compliance alternatives; and

• Establish authority to grant alternative applicability dates and paperwork submission dates, based on site-specific factors.

These limits, known as ELGs, are enforced through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), under which states typically issue permits that last five years.

Meanwhile, Trump’s ICE raid of a Hyundai EV battery plant under construction has delayed the project by up to three months.","Ford’s top boss is sounding the alarm on electric vehicles, warning that President Donald Trump’s policies are hurting the industry.

Speaking at the Ford Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit on Tuesday, CEO Jim Farley said he expects U.S. demand for EVs to shrink far more than automakers anticipated.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” Farley told the audience, according to Bloomberg. Sales of EVs currently account for nearly 10% of the broader domestic market.

Farley’s warning comes as Trump, in his second term, has rolled out a string of policies aimed at the EV market. The biggest blow being the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, which officially expired today. That incentive was scrapped under the administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that the looming deadline boosted sales temporarily. Jalopnik reports that 146,332 electric cars were sold in August, the highest monthly tally in U.S. history.

But the end of this subsidy isn’t the industry’s only hurdle. Earlier this year, Trump rolled back federal emissions standards and stripped states of the ability to set their own stricter rules. That move wiped out California and other states’ rules that would have required automakers to sell more zero-emission vehicles.

The EV industry isn’t just dealing with policy headwinds, either. Elon Musk’s growing unpopularity has turned off some buyers, potentially dragging down demand not only for Tesla but for EVs in general.

Meanwhile, Trump’s ICE raid of a Hyundai EV battery plant under construction has delayed the project by up to three months.

All of this turbulence has automakers rethinking their strategies. Some are delaying launches, while others are quietly shifting money back into internal combustion vehicles.

Nissan said in August it would further delay production of three new all-electric SUVs at its Mississippi facility, pushing the debut from 2025 all the way to 2028.

Honda also shelved plans for a large electric SUV that had been slated for 2027.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/F-150-Lightning_Mustang-Mach-E_3-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 18:03:05.164705
