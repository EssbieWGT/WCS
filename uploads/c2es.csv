CHICAGO, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. biofuel makers will consume more than half of all soybean oil produced in the U.S. next year as a recent flurry of federal policy moves has transformed the sector, including higher blending mandates and curbs on foreign biofuel imports and feedstocks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Friday.

In a monthly supply-and-demand report, the USDA sharply raised its outlook for soybean oil use by biofuel producers in the 2025/26 marketing year, which begins Oct. 1, to a record 15.5 billion pounds, up 11.5% from its forecast a month ago and 26.5% higher than the current marketing year.

U.S. soy oil exports were seen tumbling to 700 million pounds in 2025/26 as more oil is consumed domestically, down from 2.6 billion pounds in the current season.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix in 2026 and 2027, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates, along with measures to discourage biofuel imports.

The moves were welcomed by the nation's fast-growing biofuels industry after months of policy uncertainty that had hobbled output of fuels made from vegetable oils like soy oil, canola oil and used cooking oil.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the U.S. fuel supply or purchase credits known as RINs from those that do.

""EPA not only significantly raised the mandates but also proposed to reduce the number of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) generated for imported renewable fuels and renewable fuels produced from foreign feedstocks starting in 2026, which increases demand for domestically produced feedstocks like soybean oil,"" the USDA said on Friday.

Additional incentives via state biofuel mandates and the federal 45Z clean fuel production tax credit in U.S. President Donald Trump's recently enacted budget law further fueled the outlook for soy oil use in biofuel, the USDA said.

Sherita Hamlin has watched her utility bills more than double in recent years. On Chicago’s West Side, summer air conditioning is a luxury she now rations. Groceries and entertainment for her five children take a back seat to keeping the lights on.

Hamlin estimates that her monthly electric bill has climbed from $70 to $150 over the last five years, while her monthly winter gas bills have risen from $110 to $220.

“I thank God for the LIHEAP program,” she said, referring to the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federal energy assistance program that helped her avoid shutoffs. “Once that credit kicks in, it helps knock down the past due bills.”

That critical support is now in jeopardy.

Support for people like Hamlin could be undermined by the Trump administration’s push to defund federal energy assistance for low-income households, eliminate clean energy tax credits, and keep expensive coal generation online.

The Trump administration fired every staffer administering the LIHEAP program this spring, and the administration has proposed eliminating funding for the program entirely.

Across the Great Lakes, electricity and gas costs are rising, with utilities in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin seeking hundreds of millions in additional rate hikes. Advocates point to a perfect storm: aging infrastructure, climate-driven disasters, profit incentives that reward utility spending, high rates of return for investors, and weak regulatory oversight.

Energy bills outrun inflation: ‘National issue’

As of April 2025, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin had the highest residential electric rates in the East North Central region, outpacing Indiana and Ohio, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Nationally, residential energy bills have outpaced inflation since 2022, according to the EIA data, while consumers face rising costs for other essentials like food and housing.

Between 2014 and 2024, electric rates in Illinois and Michigan rose slightly faster than inflation, while Wisconsin’s stayed just below it. Over the longer term, inflation-adjusted rates have climbed sharply: since 2001, residential electricity prices have increased in Michigan (31%), Wisconsin (23%), and Illinois (3%)

Most real wage growth since 2001 has accrued to higher-income workers, while real wages for low- and middle-income groups have remained largely stagnant. This leaves lower- and middle-income groups less able to keep up with inflation for basic necessities like utilities.

Research from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy shows that a significant portion of low-income households spend a disproportionate share of their income on energy bills.

Energy affordability experts consider 6% of income spent on energy to be affordable. But in many U.S. metro areas, one in four low-income households spends over 15% of their income on energy, far above that threshold. These high energy burdens can force difficult choices between paying utility bills and other essentials like food or medicine.

“This is a national issue — but we’re not having a national conversation about it,” said Charles Hua, director of the advocacy group PowerLines. While wildfires raise prices in the West and gas volatility affects the Northeast, ballooning infrastructure costs are the main driver in the Midwest, Hua said.

Utilities earn a rate of return on capital investments, which encourages them to build rather than maintain infrastructure, Hua said. Public service commissions approve these profit rates — often approaching 10% — that companies then return to shareholders.

The impact is deeply felt. Eighty-one percent of Midwest ratepayers feel powerless over rising bills, the highest percentage of any U.S. region, according to a recent PowerLines/Ipsos poll. Most expect rates to increase further, and two-thirds say utility costs are a source of financial stress.

‘Relentless churn’ of rate hike requests

Utilities in the Great Lakes states are filing rate hike requests more frequently, and often with little resistance, advocates say. Regulators and consumer advocates often find themselves outmatched, working under tight deadlines and with fewer resources than the utilities they’re tasked with overseeing.

“We’re seeing a relentless churn of rate case filings across the Upper Midwest,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute.

In Michigan, the timeline between Consumers Energy’s electric rate requests shrank from 18 months in 2012 to 15 months in 2024. DTE Energy’s filings accelerated from every two years to roughly every 17 months, according to MLive. At the same time, lawmakers shortened the review window for rate cases from 12 to 10 months, leaving less time for scrutiny from public interest groups and the public.

“That creates an asymmetry where the utility gets whatever time they want to prepare their rate cases … and the rest of us have what works out to be a tight schedule to argue against it,” said Douglas Jester, a consultant with 5 Lakes Energy who frequently contributes to rate case testimony.

Michigan’s 2016 energy law made the process even tougher by allowing utilities to base rate increases on future projected spending rather than historical costs. The industry refers to this as the “future test year” model. Critics argue that it requires regulators to approve budgets without full visibility into utility operations.

Illinois and Wisconsin face similar time constraints for rate case decisions as Michigan, while Weinman said regulators often work with limited staff.

Abe Scarr of Illinois PIRG said it’s a one-sided system.

“They know everything about their infrastructure — we know only what we can extract.”

Weinmann said that rate hike requests compound previous increases, and utilities are likely to continue their pace of requests until they encounter pushback from regulators.

“We’re seeing examples here and there where commissions limit to varying degrees how much utilities can raise rates, but they’re still achieving the objective of raising rates,” she said.

‘Gold plating’ the grid

Consumer advocates say utilities are inflating costs by “gold plating” the grid: investing in unnecessary capital projects to maximize profits, rather than prioritizing preventive maintenance like tree trimming.

“There’s always concern they’re pushing too much into the capital side,” said Tom Content, director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin.

Here’s how it works: When utilities invest in infrastructure — like poles, wires, or substations — they’re allowed to recover those costs from customers, plus a rate of return, approved by state regulators. This profit is only earned on capital spending, not operational expenses, giving utilities a financial incentive to build more, even if it’s not the most efficient option.

Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, said costly and often avoidable replacements of transmission lines, transformers, poles, and pole tops are examples of overbuilding for investor gain.

At the center of this problem is the high rate of return utilities earn on infrastructure investments. In Michigan and Wisconsin, those returns have hovered around 10%, despite utility stocks being low-risk compared to the broader market. A January report from the Economic Liberties Project found these profits cost the average U.S. customer an additional $300 per year.

5 Lakes Energy’s Jester said Michigan regulators have generally reduced the capital costs utilities can recoup in rate cases, typically by 40%–50%, although advocates push for 60%-70% cuts. Shrinking the gap between what utilities propose and what’s truly needed could help keep rates below inflation, he said.

Still, not all costs are avoidable. Aging infrastructure and climate extremes are driving legitimate spending needs. A 2024 state audit revealed that significant portions of DTE and Consumers Energy’s systems were over 50 years old, with some components dating back more than a century.

Severe weather is compounding the problem. In 2023, a single ice storm cost DTE $50 million in repairs. Derechos in 2020 and 2021 caused billions in regional damage, according to a report in The Detroit Free Press. These events — now more frequent due to climate change — are straining outdated systems and driving up rates.

Advocates call for stronger laws, oversight, public support

To rein in rising energy costs, advocates say states need to do more than tweak rate cases — they need stronger laws, better-funded oversight, and support for low-income customers.

In Chicago, Hamlin said the Low Income Discount program from Peoples Gas cut her monthly bills significantly. She also hopes to benefit from Illinois’s Solar for All program, which allows renters and homeowners to subscribe to community solar arrays and earn bill credits with no upfront cost.

Advocates say far more needs to be done to protect ratepayers’ interests.

“The consumer voice is really not that represented in the (public service commission) ecosystem,” said PowerLines’ Hua. “There are very few people who show up to a PSC hearing and provide public comment.”

Advocates say better funding for those groups, and the commissions themselves, would help prevent utilities from overbuilding infrastructure and provide more support for energy efficiency programs.

In Michigan, energy consultant Jester said reform would require new legislation, noting that laws give utilities an unfair advantage, such as the shortened timelines for rate case reviews. Meanwhile, utilities wield considerable political influence.

In 2022, dark money groups linked to Consumers Energy and DTE contributed a combined $9.5 million to Michigan political campaigns, according to reporting from Bridge Michigan.

Utility spokespeople say the companies follow the law and that no customer funds are used for political donations; critics dispute this claim. Advocates in Michigan have launched a ballot initiative to restrict utilities’ political donations.

DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said the company is “committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and complies with all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions.”

Consumers spokesperson Katie Carey said, “We participate in the legislative and political processes with a focus on compliance and transparency, and no customer funds are used for any political contributions.”

Bandyk, with Michigan CUB, challenges Consumers’ statement that shareholders paid for political spending. “All the revenue comes from customers,” she said.

Jester said that, despite recommendations from administrative law judges to reduce investor returns, Michigan’s utility commission has largely declined to act.

“The commission has just not been willing to go there,” he said.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SheritaHamlin-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 08:18:23.028560

Temperatures in the southwestern city of El Granado reached nearly 115 degrees (46 degrees Celsius), a national record for June.
Climate change is also transforming the Spanish landscape, including the beach in Montgat, where increasingly frequent storms have washed much of the sand away.
“The main risk humankind faces today, undoubtedly, is climate change,” said Sira Rego, a minister in the government led by Pedro Sánchez.
She said climate change had forced the city to think of its overtourism problem differently, to come up with measures that addressed both.","Not so long ago, families coming to the shore in Montgat, Spain, just outside Barcelona, built sand castles, played paddle games and lounged around on the broad band of sand that was the picture of the European summer vacation. But now in some places, there is hardly enough room to put down a towel.

“From here to there,” said Sofia Mella, 19, as she pointed far out to sea, “it was all sand.”

Climate change is changing Europe into a summer paradise lost. Across Spain, Italy, Greece, France and beyond, sand-devouring storms, rising seas, asphyxiating temperatures, deadly floods and horrific wildfires have year after year turned some of the continent’s most desired getaways into miserable locales to get away from.

As southern Europeans dream of fjords, the traditional hot spots and fixtures of travel agency package deals no longer seem so desirable. This past week, even though temperatures broke across much of the continent, experts and officials warned that the next heat wave would come soon, endangering vulnerable locals and making tourists question what they had gotten themselves into. Even activists seeking to free their cities from the scourge of overtourism saw no silver lining to the brutal conditions.

Last year, Mr. Pardo Rivacoba’s group went viral by organizing demonstrations against overtourism that including spraying tourists with water guns. This year, he said, it was so hot that “we used the water guns on ourselves.”

Across the continent, June was the cruelest month. So far. In Rome, tourists rotated around the city’s sites as if spinning in an outdoor microwave. Opera singers in Verona passed out in their costumes.

But Spain has become the least fun-in-the-sun destination. Temperatures in the southwestern city of El Granado reached nearly 115 degrees (46 degrees Celsius), a national record for June. And there were other grim metrics. Last year, floods in Valencia killed more than 200 people; this year, experts say excess deaths, especially among the ailing and elderly, have risen sharply with the temperatures.

Climate change is also transforming the Spanish landscape, including the beach in Montgat, where increasingly frequent storms have washed much of the sand away.

Barcelona, only a few miles away, has reported losing 30,000 square meters of sand over the past five years. Marina d’Or, outside Valencia farther south, was envisioned by developers and families across Spain as a seaside resort, an emblem of the country’s beach holidays. Now, storms have washed some of its beaches away, too. Experts have estimated the loss of hundreds of thousands of square meters of beach across the country, and warned about desertification.

Spain knows it has a problem. In a time of right-wing opposition to Europe’s environment-protecting Green Deal regulations — “greenlash,” it has been called — the progressive government of Spain has embraced an ecological transition.

“The main risk humankind faces today, undoubtedly, is climate change,” said Sira Rego, a minister in the government led by Pedro Sánchez. She called responding to those changes the country’s “priority in terms of security.”

At more local levels, cities like Barcelona are also trying to mitigate the damage wrought by a changing climate.

Laia Bonet, the city’s first deputy mayor responsible for ecology and urban planning, said that Barcelona was “especially exposed to the effects of climate change,” and that it was working to address the reality of a hotter city with higher sea levels and eroded beaches.

The city’s priority, she said, is protecting vulnerable residents with hundreds of climate shelters. But it is also investing 1.8 billion euros, more than $2 billion, to make buildings greener, expand green spaces, install 200 shade structures, and replace some pavements with dirt to better absorb and repurpose rain water.

The city is also using sand recovered from construction projects to help preserve its beaches, which are a beloved public space for locals to cool off, as well as a guard against storm surges, and a critical element in the city’s identity as a tourist destination. About 15 percent of Barcelona’s economy comes from tourism.

She said climate change had forced the city to think of its overtourism problem differently, to come up with measures that addressed both. “These are progressive policies that cities can implement as an antidote,” she said.

In Seville, the southern Spanish city sometimes called “the frying pan” of Europe, nuns have long hung white drapes around their cloisters to keep the sun out. But the city has more recently started covering its narrow streets with white sheets, pulled across the rooftops like canopies. Parts of the city are using an ancient system of underground ducts to bring cooler air to the surface, while another project pumps water runoff into shaded public spaces, often cooled by mists. The city has started naming heat waves to make them more palpable and memorable.

That is important, experts say, because once the heat waves pass, people tend to forget about them. So scientists in recent days have rushed out estimates that the heat wave may have tripled the death toll in afflicted regions across the continent. The goal, one of the scientists has said, is to focus attention on the dangers of extreme heat when people were extremely hot.

But instead of changing their behavior, many Southern Europeans suffering during the sweltering heat waves have resorted to hatching escape plans. In Barcelona, three older Spanish women sitting in the shade across from the city’s cathedral fantasized about cloudy Galicia in the north.

Matthew Taylor, Abbott’s public information coordinator, gave several reasons the records should not be released.
The high court ruled that it is the only body that can review whether these officials are in compliance with public records laws.
Musk and representatives for his companies did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
Abbott’s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the records, including whether The Texas Newsroom would be refunded if Paxton withholds them.","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott doesn’t want to reveal months of communications with Elon Musk or representatives from the tech mogul’s companies, arguing in part that they are of a private nature, not of public interest and potentially embarrassing.

Musk had an eventful legislative session in Texas this year. In addition to his lobbyists successfully advocating for several new laws, Abbott cited the Tesla and SpaceX CEO as the inspiration for the state creating its own efficiency office and has praised him for moving the headquarters for many of his businesses to the state in recent years.

As part of an effort to track the billionaire’s influence in the state Capitol, The Texas Newsroom in April requested Abbott and his staff’s emails since last fall with Musk and other people who have an email address associated with some of his companies.

Initially, the governor’s office said it would take more than 13 hours to review the records. It provided a cost estimate of $244.64 for the work and required full payment up front. The Texas Newsroom agreed and cut a check.

After the check was cashed, the governor’s office told The Texas Newsroom it believed all of the records were confidential and asked Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office referees disputes over public records, to allow the documents to be kept private.

Matthew Taylor, Abbott’s public information coordinator, gave several reasons the records should not be released. He argued they include private exchanges with lawyers, details about policy-making decisions and information that would reveal how the state entices companies to invest here. Releasing them to the public, he wrote, “would have a chilling effect on the frank and open discussion necessary for the decision-making process.”

Taylor also argued that the communications are confidential under an exception to public records laws known as “common-law privacy” because they consist of “information that is intimate and embarrassing and not of legitimate concern to the public, including financial decisions that do not relate to transactions between an individual and a governmental body.”

He did not provide further details about the exact content of the records.

The language Abbott’s office used appears to be fairly boilerplate. Paxton’s office, in an explanation of the common-law privacy exception on its website, mentions that “personal financial information” that doesn’t deal with government transactions “is generally highly intimate or embarrassing and must be withheld.”

But Bill Aleshire, a Texas-based attorney specializing in public records law, was appalled that the governor is claiming that months of emails between his office and one of the world’s richest people are all private.

“Right now, it appears they’ve charged you $244 for records they have no intention of giving you,” Aleshire said. “That is shocking.”

Aleshire said it’s not unusual for government agencies to tap the common-law privacy exception in an attempt to withhold records from the public. But he’s used to it being cited in cases that involve children, medical data or other highly personal information — not for emails between an elected official and a businessman.

“You’re boxing in the dark,” Aleshire said. “You can’t even see what the target is or what’s behind their claim.”

Aleshire added that due to a recent Texas Supreme Court ruling, there is effectively no way to enforce public records laws against Abbott and other top state officials. He called the decision an “ace card” for these politicians.

The case dealt with requests to release Abbott and Paxton’s communications in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde. The high court ruled that it is the only body that can review whether these officials are in compliance with public records laws.

Kevin Bagnall, a lawyer representing Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, also wrote a letter to Paxton’s office arguing the emails should be kept secret. He cited one main reason: They contain “commercial information whose disclosure would cause SpaceX substantial competitive harm.”

Most of the rest of Bagnall’s letter, which further explained SpaceX’s argument, was redacted.

Musk and representatives for his companies did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Abbott’s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the records, including whether The Texas Newsroom would be refunded if Paxton withholds them.

In a statement, he said, “The Office of the Governor rigorously complies with the Texas Public Information Act and will release any responsive information that is determined to not be confidential or excepted from disclosure.”

The office of the attorney general has 45 business days to determine whether to release Abbott’s records.",https://img.assets-d.propublica.org/v5/images/20250108-weather-press-conf09_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_quality_95_embedColorProfile_true.jpg?crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&imgixProfile=propublicaAssetsV5&q=90&w=1200&s=79ce7f1867b4ef236c71f7c2b6c5d7a5,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:49.663862

Unilever's Climate Goal Outlook | Sustainability Magazine,Chloe Williment,,,,,https://sustainabilitymag.com/news/voluntary-not-compulsory-the-change-of-environmental-goals,"In the past decade, the world has witnessed a surge in corporate climate pledges.
Downsizing in climate targets The climate regress is not just limited to the fashion sector.
The failure of voluntary corporate efforts reveals a critical flaw: without regulation, meaningful progress is unlikely.
Trade associations often lobby against environmental policies even when individual member companies publicly support climate goals.
One exception is Unilever, which assesses the climate stance of its trade groups and discloses misalignments, pledging to withdraw if necessary.","In the past decade, the world has witnessed a surge in corporate climate pledges.

More than 4,000 companies have committed to cutting emissions, switching to cleaner fuels and embracing greener operations.

However, global emissions continue to rise and could expand an additional 30% this decade, according to McKinsey & Co.

Packaged-goods maker, Unilever, is setting the example when it comes to climate goals, regularly examining the climate work of trade groups it belong to.

Fashion's supply chain efforts

Peter Ford, a former sustainability lead at fashion giant Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M), spent five years attempting to decarbonise a notoriously complex supply chain.

H&M invested approximately US$200m annually into sustainability efforts and reported a 24% reduction in supply chain emissions, thanks to initiatives such as energy efficiency upgrades and the phasing out of coal boilers.

However, while a few companies are making genuine progress, many are passive, waiting for external forces to catalyse change rather than leading it.

The apparel sector, despite scattered success stories, is still on track to increase emissions by 30% this decade.

“It’s a really problematic dynamic where companies hide behind these groups and let them do the dirty work, so they don’t have to say they’re opposed to these things,” says Dara O’Rourke, a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and Former Sustainability Scientist at Amazon.com Inc.

Downsizing in climate targets

The climate regress is not just limited to the fashion sector.

In the last year alone, major corporations across various industries have walked back their climate targets:

BP increased oil drilling while cutting back on renewable investment

Coca-Cola and PepsiCo weakened plastic reduction goals set in 2021

Wells Fargo and HSBC diluted their emissions-reduction strategies

FedEx admitted it will likely miss its electric vehicle procurement target

Walmart acknowledged delays in meeting climate milestones.

This retreat coincides with political developments, particularly in the US, where recent deregulation efforts and withdrawal from international climate accords have created a permissive environment for such rollbacks.

“I am heartened by the alacrity of the retreat and the ferociousness of it, because I think it uncovers the reality that we all need to understand, which is companies aren’t going to save the planet,” says Ken Pucker, a Professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy and Former Chief Operating Officer at apparel maker Timberland.

“The quicker that people understand and integrate that, the better.”

The cost of decarbonisation

Many sustainability projects, like LED upgrades and rooftop solar installations, pay off quickly.

However, true decarbonisation demands far more capital-intensive measures, such as retiring fossil fuel infrastructure or switching to low-carbon, green materials.

“I would happily spend the rest of my life changing lightbulbs and retrofitting buildings,” says Auden Schendler, who ran sustainability at Aspen Skiing Co. and its parent company, Aspen One, for 26 years, before recently stepping down.

“It’s incredibly gratifying, it saves money, it reduces pollution, it makes buildings run better.

""But here’s the only problem: It’s not a solution to the climate problem.”

These investments often carry uncertain returns and clash with corporate cultures focused on quarterly earnings.

Mars as an example is a privately owned food conglomerate committed to halving its carbon footprint by 2030, implementing more than 500 initiatives with an annual cost of around US$500m – approximately 1% of annual revenue.

Even with a 16% emissions cut achieved by 2023, such financial commitment is rare among publicly traded firms under shareholder pressure.

Is voluntary action enough?

The failure of voluntary corporate efforts reveals a critical flaw: without regulation, meaningful progress is unlikely.

Many companies continue to undermine climate policy through trade associations and lobbying:

Airlines: While committing to net zero goals, resist mandates on SAF, which currently represents just 0.3% of their consumption. In Europe, regulators have stepped in, mandating 2% cleaner fuel now and 6% by 2030 however, US carriers oppose rules like these, including a recent California proposal that would have regulated jet fuel for flights in the state.

Hotel giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Marriott International Inc, promise big emissions cuts, whilst supporting trade groups that sue to block energy efficiency regulations for buildings.

Businesses: At a national level, the Business Roundtable, which is packed with companies that trumpet their climate efforts, recently urged Congress to ban climate-related shareholder resolutions.

Trade associations often lobby against environmental policies even when individual member companies publicly support climate goals.

Few companies are known to challenge this misalignment.

In May, Gov. Kay Ivey (R-AL) signed a bill into law that establishes an “energy infrastructure bank” to provide loans to eligible utility projects to meet the increasing power demand and accelerate the development of rural areas. The bill, named the Powering Growth Act, also allocates $50 million to two state funds to boost industrial development.

Ohio delivered on lowering taxes, removing subsidies, expediting the permitting process, and other energy reforms through an extensive bill designed to facilitate more in-state electric generation. Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) signed the bill, which will take effect Aug. 14.

South Carolina passed a bill clearing the way to open a new 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant in coordination with Dominion Energy, encouraging the development of nuclear energy to meet the state’s growing energy demands. Gov. Henry McMaster (R-SC) signed the legislation last month, following through on his promise to expand the state’s use of nuclear power.

Republican officials are confident the legislative efforts will help meet their states’ energy consumption and foster economic growth once the laws are in full swing.

“State Republicans are implementing an America first energy agenda that reduces costs for American families and counteracts the Democrats’ restrictive policies that hinder our energy infrastructure,” Mason Di Palma, communications director of the Republican State Leadership Committee, told the Washington Examiner. “We are implementing practical solutions to lower prices at the pump and enhance America’s energy grid, all while promoting economic growth.”

In California, gas prices rose significantly after a gas excise tax increase and updated emissions rules took effect on July 1.

Gas is increasing by 1.6 cents per gallon, bringing the total tax to 61.2 cents per gallon. The state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard rules are expected to incur higher costs, with an estimated increase of 5 to 8 cents per gallon at the gas pump or even a 65-cent hike in the short term.

The latter number was put forward in an October 2024 study published by the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. The study also found that gas prices will increase by 85 cents per gallon by 2030 and $1.50 per gallon by 2035. The study blames California’s LCFS program for the rapid rise in gas prices.

In November 2024, the California Air Resources Board approved the updated emissions regulations to help meet the state’s goal of 30% carbon reduction by 2030 and 90% reduction by 2045. The revised rules are part of the state’s efforts to transition from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles by 2035.

California Republicans took aim at the 65-cent hike to argue against the state’s emissions regulations, while Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and his administration claimed the oil industry is peddling misinformation about the state’s rising gas prices.

California currently has the highest average gas price across the nation at $4.54 per gallon, according to AAA data on fuel prices, although it is gradually decreasing by the day. Hawaii has the second highest at $4.47 per gallon. Most states, however, are experiencing a wave of lower gas prices that hasn’t been seen since 2021; the national average is $3.17 per gallon.

The White House attributes the drop in gas prices to Trump’s focus on gas and oil over renewable energy sources.

While many red states embrace fossil fuels and renewable energy sources, which they see as a way to diversify energy supplies and reduce electricity costs, blue states primarily appear to be defending their clean energy goals. Notably, California is currently retreating from some of its climate policies as it faces political pressure.

In New York, Democratic lawmakers blocked GOP legislation that would have required a cost-benefit analysis of renewable energy and zero-emissions mandates. The bill would also have delayed the mandates for another 10 years to give the state time to assess whether they would increase electricity rates by over 5%.

Republicans blamed the New York State Assembly’s Democratic majority for killing the bill.

The executive branch doesn’t have the same obstacles when reversing climate mandates.

Trump recently phased out subsidies for renewable energy sources through an executive order following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The order directs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar energy and tasks Interior Secretary Doug Burgum with revising regulations that give preferential treatment to such energy sources.

The action is designed to increase the nation’s energy security and independence, which has become a priority for national security-minded Republicans who want to make the United States less reliant on foreign countries for energy production.

China controls over 80% of the global market for components needed to make solar panels or lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Some believe this is intentional.

A recent report from State Armor posits that Beijing pushes “green” technologies to make the U.S. more dependent on China’s energy supply chain and that the foreign adversary co-opts climate change lobbying to force a retreat from fossil fuels. The report cites the Chinese Communist Party’s ties to Energy Foundation China as evidence for its argument.

The tax-exempt nonprofit organizations, led by former Chinese Communist Party official Ji Zou, influence climate policy in the U.S. Zou previously served on China’s climate negotiation team for the 2015 Paris Agreement. Although the organization’s headquarters are in San Francisco, California, its primary operations are in Beijing, China.

EFC is “really operating as an extension of the Chinese Communist Party, and they shouldn’t enjoy this 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations status that’s reserved” for educational, charitable, and religious organizations, American Energy Institute CEO and former Texas State Rep. Jason Isaac told the Washington Examiner. “They’re taking advantage of that and to our detriment.”

The pro-China nonprofit has funded research at flagship educational institutions, such as Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, according to State Armor’s report. It has also funneled at least $12 million to liberal climate nonprofits, like the National Resources Defense Council, since 2020.

EFC also “supported Harvard’s research of creating a hydrogen hub in Texas meant to decarbonize the United States and beyond,” Isaac said. “Decarbonization is a political agenda propagated by the Chinese Communist Party.”

Chinese-affiliated entities have also taken an interest in Texas land over the years.

Houston-based company GH America, which is controlled by Chinese billionaire Sun Guangxin, paid an estimated $110 million to acquire 140,000 acres of land in Val Verde County, Texas. Guangxin purchased 15,000 acres of land to develop a wind farm on, sparking concerns because of its proximity to Texas’s electric grid and an Air Force base.

The acquisition caught the attention of Texas lawmakers, who in 2021 unanimously passed a bill banning contracts between Texas entities and foreign businesses that would grant the latter access to the state’s electric grid and other critical infrastructure.

Expanding its restrictions on China, the Texas legislature recently approved a bill that denies land ownership to foreign entities of concern. The Department of Agriculture plans to implement a nationwide ban on farmland bought by people and companies from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. The state law takes effect Sept. 1.

State Republicans were at the forefront of crafting both pieces of legislation.

GAS PRICES: CONTINUE TO FALL AFTER THE JULY FOURTH HOLIDAY

While blue states like New York double down on climate mandates and emissions regulations, red states like Texas are advancing practical policies that lower energy prices, streamline permitting, and curb foreign influence.

With the Trump administration reinforcing these efforts at the federal level, the Republican Party’s energy strategy is gaining momentum as a viable alternative to progressive climate policies. It offers voters a stark contrast between regulatory restraint and government-sponsored decarbonization in the nation’s complex energy debate.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/windmills.webp,N,,2025-07-14 08:18:00.930829

California has allocated billions of dollars to address the needs of its most overburdened communities through the Transformative Climate Communities Program and the Community Air Protection Program.","Forty years ago, when I began what would become a landmark study on race and toxic waste in the United States, there was no name for the stark pattern we saw: race was more powerful than any other factor in predicting where hazardous waste facilities were located. Nor was there a name for the shared struggle that people of color—along with low-income White communities—were engaged in for access to clean air, clean water, and a livable future.

Fast forward to 2025. The Trump Administration was able to prioritize cuts in environmental program personnel and grants by zeroing in on the words that we once lacked: environmental justice (EJ).

Since the early 1980s, an ever-growing number of people have embraced EJ as an important part of their work, or they have used this vital lens to look at and develop solutions for many of the nation’s problems. With the Trump Administration’s recent extreme and reckless attacks on this work, individuals and organizations seeking to advance EJ are understandably distressed and pondering how they can continue to make progress on issues that are rooted in deep evidence and are dear to their hearts.

A lesson about “small groups making big impacts” from my work during the earliest days of the EJ movement may be instructive in these times.

The spark that ignited a movement

Perhaps the most influential report in EJ history was produced by a small advocacy organization, not a well-resourced university or government agency. The Commission for Racial Justice was established by the United Church of Christ to exercise self-determinative leadership for its Black constituency. Our 1987 study, Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, the first national study on the demographic characteristics associated with the location of hazardous waste sites, catapulted the issue of disproportionate environmental burden to national attention by bringing empirical evidence to bear. It helped to create a whole new field of community advocacy, academic research, and public policy. Dr. Dorceta Taylor, Yale University’s Wangari Mathai Professor of Environmental Justice called this study “the spark that ignited a movement” during the 2025 New Horizons in Conservation Conference.

Professor Robert Bullard, the preeminent EJ activist scholar at Texas Southern University, emphasized that the study was done by a small “Black civil rights organization.” Speaking on the Eyes on the Prize III, sequel to the award-winning PBS documentary series on the civil rights movement, he also recounted how during the early days of the EJ movement, “we had to fight [and] scrape [to] convince the entire policy world that our issues matter.”

Today, Dr. Bullard directs the Robert Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice, which started as a small team and recently began receiving multimillion dollar grants from Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bezos Earth Fund, Houston Endowment, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

A more recent example of small efforts making a big difference is the development of the Washington State Environmental Health Disparities Map by Dr. Esther Min when she was a graduate student at the University of Washington. Her work was part of a statewide campaign led by the statewide EJ coalition Front and Centered.

A legacy of small groups making big impacts

Today, this legacy of “small groups making big impacts” represents an incredibly important lesson as EJ must endure a period of extreme attacks and diminished resources due to the Trump Administration. The spirit of “fighting and scraping,” in Dr. Bullard’s words, has always been a constant for the EJ movement. It is also a timeless lesson as this is neither the first nor the last time that we have dealt with such adversity.

EJ has been called the civil rights issue of the 21st century. Since it works towards shifting power to marginalized communities, the EJ movement will inevitably go through many ebbs and flows. Its ability to make a difference in overburdened and underserved communities will be drastically affected by what happens within the federal government, but its vibrancy has never been predicated on the existence or non-existence of federal policies and programs. The remarkable successes thus far of the EJ movement is the result of advocacy and action by a growing network of communities and their partners throughout US society.

Also, we should not lose sight of the fact that all of us now work with infinitely more assets than we had when I started the UCC study in the mid-1980s. Whereas, for example, the maps in Toxic Wastes and Race were drawn by hand, we currently have Geographic Information Systems-based programs, such as the California Environmental Protection Agency’s CalEnviroScreen and US EPA’s EJScreen tools (the latter taken down by the Trump Administration but mirrored by the Public Environmental Data Partners), that combines and visualizes multiple layers of data in a matter of seconds.

There are numerous community-based organizations focused on EJ, of which WE ACT for Environmental Justice (WE ACT), the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice (DSEJ), and the Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) are but just three examples, along with partners in multiple sectors of society. WE ACT, DSCEJ, EHC, and other EJ organizations regularly conduct public campaigns, webinars, and other activities for people who are looking for a place to get involved in EJ. Local EJ organizations are working on a wide range of environmental, health, climate, economic, and quality-of-life issues in all parts of the country.

In addition, hundreds of universities have EJ courses or degree programs, including a PhD program at the University of Michigan School of Environment and Sustainability, as well as innovative projects like the University of Richmond’s Mapping Inequality Project that digitized the redlining maps from the 1930s. Thousands of peer-reviewed journal articles have been published in virtually all fields associated with health, environment, and sustainability. Established environmental and civil society organizations like EarthJustice and Environmental Protection Network, alongside the Union of Concerned Scientists, have prioritized efforts to address the concerns of the nation’s most overburdened and underserved communities.

EJ laws, policies, or programs now exist at multiple levels of government and in virtually every state and the District of Columbia. California has allocated billions of dollars to address the needs of its most overburdened communities through the Transformative Climate Communities Program and the Community Air Protection Program. New Jersey is implementing the first law in the nation to require mandatory denial of permits for facilities that add greater environmental burdens in already overburdened communities. Chicago is implementing a citywide EJ Action Plan as well as pursuing a Cumulative Impacts Ordinance—named after none other than the pioneering Hazel Johnson.

Environmental justice is here to stay

Not only do these assets exist, but advocates, researchers, and practitioners continue to meet the demand for the increasingly critical work.

For example, the recent study of cumulative impacts in the fenceline communities of Southeastern Pennsylvania by scientists at Johns Hopkins University found that the air we breathe may often be worse than we thought. The study’s authors asserted that we will never truly characterize the true impacts of pollution on human health without addressing this issue.

Or, consider the Climate Safe Neighborhoods project of Groundwork USA, which uses maps and data of past residential segregation practices and current climate impacts to work with municipalities across the nation to build resilience to extreme heat and flooding.

Similarly, UCS’ Looming Deadlines for Coastal Resilience report used the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool to pinpoint areas of concern for loss of critical affordable housing along the coasts. The need for more work like this grows exponentially as our climate crisis deepens.

The EJ movement now benefits from multiple generations of thought leadership. I was gratified to see how the recent Yale New Horizons Conference showcased the work of several hundred young, talented, energetic, and, in many ways, already remarkably accomplished student fellows. The EJ movement’s authentic collaborations across multiple disciplines, institutions, and sectors are perhaps its most important attributes. We now possess the intellectual and social capacity to understand and solve the complex issues involved.

These times will be profoundly difficult and painful to communities disproportionately affected by environmental burdens, but the EJ movement is alive, resilient, and full of people—old and young—who have demonstrated amazing talent and resourcefulness and are fiercely committed, tenacious, and audacious.

To be sure, local communities everywhere continue to fight and win. Witness the recent victory by Alabama community groups to update water toxicity standards. Or the California Public Utilities Commission’s formal designation of the California EJ Alliance to coordinate authentic community engagement for the state’s Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing Program. This work—fighting to ensure that this nation fulfills its promise of ensuring environmental protection and thriving communities for all people—is now more urgent than ever.

Speaking from the perspective of having worked on EJ issues since before they even had a name, I have no doubt that we will continue to make progress.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-0714-guest-blog.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:43.379304

Sharon Buttry drives by the Jayne-Lasky Park on Detroit’s east side, she points to the expansive 65-acre park, located just miles from her home.

“I tell people when they take their kids to the park, wear masks,” she said.

Buttry, a clergy leader at the American Baptist Churches USA who is on the board of the ​Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments, is headed just north of the park to the Cadillac Heights neighborhood, a quiet community that now is the epicenter of a bitter fight over a proposed expansion of a concrete facility that area residents fear is dangerously polluting their air.

She navigates her car along a potholed road running between the plant site and a large, grassless lot bordering the plant that used to feature dozens of single family homes that have since been bulldozed. “This used to be a thriving neighborhood,” she said.

While many homes have been bought out and demolished by an entity affiliated with the Kronos Concrete plant, the remaining neighborhood homes have become enveloped by truck traffic and dust generated by operations at the plant. Kronos opened in 2022 and is controlled by the notoriously wealthy and powerful Maroun family, which counts large swaths of Detroit real estate among its holdings. The concrete facility is part of the Moroun-owned subsidiary, Hercules Materials Holdings LLC, which didn’t respond to requests for comment on the air quality concerns and expansion.

On its website the company touts the Kronos facility as a $10,000,000 investment into Cadillac Heights, calling it the biggest investment into the community in decades. It says the site development will include tree plantings and other street improvements, none of which have been done to date.

The facility was under construction before it secured the necessary permits, and now the neighborhood fears the Maroun family is planning an expansion that would expand the concrete mixing and truck traffic, which worsen the air pollution surrounding the plant, the residents say.

For those breathing that air, it is already at dangerous levels.

Air quality testing near the plant by Detroit-based startup JustAir shows that over the past year pollutants known as PM2.5 exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health standards more than 54% of the days. Inhalation of these tiny air pollutants, which are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair, are linked to asthma, heart and lung problems and preterm births. The testing does not prove the pollution spikes are due to Kronos. But Buttry hopes the data will help her push for a plant shutdown.

“This level of pollution is a direct threat to human health,” she said.

The PM2.5 data, which came from a small air monitor set up on the corner of the plant lot, would have been unavailable just a couple years ago. The nearest state monitor is miles away.

“This level of pollution is a direct threat to human health.” -Rev. Sharon Buttry

The air monitor at the Kronos site is one of 100 installed last year across Detroit and surrounding Wayne County by JustAir, a tech company that got its start four years ago and was inspired after founder and Detroit resident Darren Riley developed asthma. The installations were a partnership with Wayne County, which provided funding for the monitors and works with JustAir to deliver the data to residents. Previously in Detroit there were only seven air monitors run by the state, five run by the city.

“We prioritized high-pollution and high-vulnerability areas such as neighborhoods near industrial corridors and schools,” said Warren Evans, Wayne County executive.

The work by JustAir adds to a growing network of organizations and residents deploying air monitors across Detroit, which has long suffered from some of the worst air and highest rates of asthma in the country. More than 1,000 residents are now receiving air quality text alerts from JustAir, according to JustAir chief operating officer Sarah Craft.

“There are so many people who have power to actually do something with this outside of the federal government,” Craft said.

Individuals armed with real-time data about air quality can make informed decisions about when to stay indoors, Craft noted. Others made aware of air quality concerns told Craft they made behavioral changes, such as a father who stopped idling his vehicle when he picks up his daughter from school, and a mother who realized her smoking makes bad air days even worse for her kids.

“And so these are just like teeny tiny things, but it’s behavioral awareness,” Craft said.

The findings from the air quality monitors can’t be used to enforce regulations. And community air monitoring can be imperfect. However, advocates say the ever-expanding monitoring and access to data is shining a light on the worst sources of pollution and empowering residents and local officials.

“It’s time to have discussions with our elected officials and industry polluters … and establish sanctions that will correct behaviors and improve the environment,” said Cinthya Casillas, a Detroit resident who’s on the JustAir Advisory Committee.

Detroit’s air quality problems

The US has seen a 37% decrease in the national average of PM2.5 levels over the past two decades, largely thanks to stricter regulations, but the pollutant remains potent in Detroit. The city received an “F” grade on the American Lung Association’s latest State of the Air report, and was ranked sixth worst city out of 208 for annual particle pollution.

Earlier this year, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) told the EPA that Wayne County was breaking federal standards for PM2.5.

The EPA has a year to evaluate whether Wayne County should be designated as a “non-attainment” area for PM2.5, which would force the county to work with the state and make a plan to reduce the pollution.

The Trump administration said it is reviewing PM2.5 regulations, signaling that it will reduce the health standards. It’s unclear how this would affect areas out of compliance like Wayne County.

Particulate matter — along with other harmful air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone — are near-daily features of life for many residents across Detroit.

“I was asthmatic when I was a child, but I feel like my breathing is getting worse, even though I’m not asthmatic anymore. It’s something that we see a lot in Detroit, especially in southwest Detroit,” said Casillas, who lives in the Hubbard Richard neighborhood on the city’s southwest side, which has the highest levels of air pollution in the state.

Last year Detroit was named the third worst city in the US to live in with asthma by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. The most recent asthma data from the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services found that the rate of child asthma in Detroit was 14.6% compared to the state’s 8.4%.

Air quality information is critical for vulnerable populations, such as people with asthma, said Nelson Roque, an assistant professor and researcher at Penn State who published a study this year on air quality “deserts.”

“Without information, we rely on our best sensor, our nose, but that’s no way to quantify dangers,” he said.

Empowering residents — and local officials

The JustAir monitoring data is also cited in a lawsuit filed by an area resident against the company that owns the land the Kronos plant sits on, Crown Enterprises. Air sampling near the plant shows that PM2.5 readings have increased from an average of 10.3 μg/m3 in 2024 to 12.46 μg/m3 as of 2025, and have spiked to as high as 259.4 μg/m3, “far exceeding safe air quality standards designed to protect human health,” the lawsuit states.

The data show a “significant deterioration in air quality since Crown’s Kronos site concrete operations intensified,” according to the lawsuit.

“At least for the time period that that monitor has been running, the area is not in compliance with the national air quality standards for particulate matter,” said Andrew Bashi, a lawyer at the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center. Bashi is not involved in the lawsuit but has been advocating on behalf of residents who anticipate a plant expansion.

The lawsuit is a counter complaint as Crown Enterprises, which did not respond to requests for comment, originally had sued the resident, alleging he trespassed on company property.

“At least for the time period that that monitor has been running, the area is not in compliance with the national air quality standards for particulate matter.” – Andrew Bashi, Great Lakes Environmental Law Center

In a response to the resident’s counter-complaint, Crown’s attorneys denied all of the allegations of pollution and environmental harm as untrue. The response states that Crown denies it “is subjecting a small neighborhood to severe environmental harm and disruption,” denies that it “has caused environmental hazards off-site,” and denies that the resident is entitled “to any relief.”

Bashi added that the PM2.5 is much higher at the JustAir monitor at the fenceline of the facility than it is at any of the nearby state monitors. The monitor near Kronos showed that the highest day for PM2.5 over the past year was more than 7.5 times the EPA health threshold. “It indicates that there’s something unique about that area,” he said.

This is a major advantage of having these additional monitors, Roque said, as they give more granular information and paint a fuller picture.

Local officials used JustAir data to push back on the state and federal government this year when Wayne County executive Evans sent a letter to state regulators citing the data from new monitors disagreeing with the state’s plan to remove the county’s non-attainment status for sulfur dioxide. Evans said the state monitoring methods “do not fully account for real-world conditions or the cumulative impacts on nearby communities” and provided JustAir data that showed harmful levels of sulfur dioxide jeopardize “the health of residents living in this area.”

Casillas said JustAir data allows her and her family to be instantly alerted to bad air that could harm them. “I use it in combination with my weather app …that also gives me an alert that the air is not good right now, don’t go out,” she said.

Stuart Batterman, an environmental sciences and public health researcher and professor at the University of Michigan and the co-investigator at Community Action to Promote Healthy Environments, a university partnership with communities in Detroit to tackle dirty air, said the proliferation of air monitoring has brought residents a greater level of scientific literacy. “People know about PM2.5 and we don’t have to say exactly what it is anymore,” he said. “People get it.”

The Green Door Initiative, a Detroit environmental nonprofit that works with JustAir on monitoring efforts, this year launched an Air Quality Advocacy Academy, a 9-month training for more than a dozen Detroiters to learn about air quality and monitoring, environmental justice and advocacy. “They can take this knowledge … become community leaders,” said Duaa Ballout, a program manager at the Green Door Initiative.

“People know about PM2.5 and we don’t have to say exactly what it is anymore. People get it.” – Stuart Batterman, University of Michigan

Ballout said the Academy is already having an impact — residents started a petition to stop an industrial pump station in a Detroit neighborhood. “We consider that a win because they are taking the information that they are learning and applying it to their everyday life.”

Challenges remain

There are challenges with community air monitors. Craft said a few monitors have been damaged or gone missing. Many monitors are solar powered and Detroit had a cloudy, long winter. And sometimes there are software bugs.

“Challenges just exist,” she said. “Things go wrong. And there are things that this data can prove and also things that this data can’t prove. It does not measure everything.”

The city has provided air purification equipment to some homes. But at the same time, sources for air pollution in Detroit are expanding.

Michigan’s EGLE just approved an expansion for one of the region’s most prolific polluters — DTE Energy’s EES Coke facility on Zug Island, sitting on the south end of Detroit. The city is also adding a second bridge to Canada — the Gordie Howe International Bridge, named after the city’s famous Detroit Red Wings hockey player — which will bring more traffic pollutants.

“One of the biggest challenges is making sure that air quality data is not just collected but actually reaches and resonates with the people who need it most,” Evans said. “Data is only as useful as the number of people who know about it.”

But residents like Casillas remain optimistic. JustAir has given her and her family and friends information they wouldn’t otherwise have.

“I’m a family advocate for head start programming. And we have a lot of kids who have breathing issues,” she said, adding that the information allows her to know when to keep children from playing outside to reduce their exposure to the air pollutants.

There’s a monitor just a few blocks from her house. “We wanted to have it there because we have the constant traffic of trucks that are going from Canada to Michigan” on the Ambassador Bridge, she said.

The bridge averages about 10,000 vehicles a day, and traffic plays an huge role in Casillas’ neighborhoods’ air problems — Batterman and colleagues attribute about 40% of PM2.5 emissions in the city to traffic and construction equipment.

While the JustAir monitors are giving Detroiters a fuller picture of their air, Roque said “it should be the EPA or state funding these.”

“As amazing as these efforts are,” community air monitoring “passes the burden to the people already affected,” Roque said.",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4333.HEIC-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:46.914947

In his welcome remarks, Dr PK Bhattacharya stated, “Recent policy boosts like 2nd tranche Viability Gap Funding in June 2025 which lowering of upfront battery storage costs in grid-scale tenders supports such aspirations. However, in order to reach the goal, there is also a need to strengthen institutional capacity and address skill gaps in the workforce to manage technology integration and business growth. In this context, under StoREin project, one of the key component is to access skill gaps, map institutional capabilities, propose actionable strategies, development of training courses for capacity building and development of workforce aligning to the industry requirements.”

Arpit Sharma, in his special address, emphasized the significance of workforce readiness in driving the clean energy transition. “As India has an ambitious target of achieving 500 GW of RE by 2030, aims at 50 percent of energy requirements to be met by non – fossil fuels and need for round the clock (RTC) power.""

""The skill in BESS sector still remains untapped, and the need to create nationally approved job roles in order to meet the mission and creation of skilled workforce, Skill Council Green Jobs has joined hand with TERI to carry out a skill gap assessment study, identify potential job roles, development of curriculum and imparting training programs in the BESS ecosystem. This will give a big thrust to the industry in terms of upskilling.” he asserted.

TERI and SCGJ aim to collaborate on a wide range of capacity-building activities, including the assessment of training needs, development of standardized frameworks, design of training curricula and resources, stakeholder engagement, and support for certification and accreditation. The agreement provides flexibility to broaden the scope of collaboration to include other areas of mutual interest as the partnership evolves.

The MoU aligns with the objectives of the ongoing StoREin (Scaling up Storage in Renewable Energy Integration) project, which focuses on strengthening institutional and human capacity to support India’s growing BESS ecosystem. The Indo-German development cooperation project is being implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) under the umbrella of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The project is being implemented in close cooperation with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India.

With India’s National Electricity Plan projecting a requirement of 47.24 GW of battery energy storage by 2031-32, this collaboration foregrounds the urgent need for a skilled, industry-aligned workforce to support the country’s clean energy ambitions.

The roundtable session, organized as part of IESW, brought together senior representatives from government agencies, renewable energy developers, battery manufacturers, system integrators, DISCOMs, academic institutions, training providers, philanthropic organizations, consulting firms, and financing institutions.

Switching to clean energy is a win for everyone.","In a win for the economy and the climate, clean energy options like solar and wind plants remain cheaper to construct than gas-fired power plants, even without government subsidies, Reuters reported.

The information comes from a June report released by financial advisory firm Lazard. It found that when it comes to large, utility-scale plants, solar farms cost between $38 and $78 per megawatt-hour to build, while a gas-combined cycle plant falls between $48 and $107 per megawatt-hour, Reuters said. (Thanks to larger-scale operations being more efficient, smaller-scale facilities are more costly in both cases.)

In fact, gas-fired power plants are at their highest price point in the last decade, thanks to the country's growing demand for electricity to power data centers and electric vehicles. This has created a backlog for parts, such as turbines.

That ongoing demand means more power plants will need to be built in a hurry — and the current costs could determine what kind of providers choose, shaping the U.S. power grid for decades to come. That's why it's so exciting that clean energy is in the lead in terms of cost.

Wind and solar lead the pack in terms of producing affordable energy for consumers while also creating stable jobs. Not only that, but they don't produce toxic air pollution like oil and coal, so they're healthier for the American public.

The same lack of air pollution makes them better for the climate because they're not producing heat-trapping gases that overheat the Earth and cause unstable and extreme weather. Switching to clean energy is a win for everyone.

Looking ahead, despite ongoing global pressures and with softening market conditions, optimism is anticipated to persist according to the Renewable Energy Market Review 2025 published today by Willis, (NASDAQ: WTW), a WTW business.

The review, titled Next-gen renewables: Risk resilience and insurance readiness, includes commentary on emerging market dynamics across key regions. It highlights the next wave of renewable energy innovations and outlines strategies to navigate growing global uncertainty. Together, these insights deliver a comprehensive analysis of the risks and opportunities shaping the sector in 2025.

Several key trends are explored in this years’ review:

Softening market conditions persist: an oversupply of capacity is intensifying competition among insurers, continuing to drive pricing downward.

Natural catastrophe losses remain a major concern: severe weather events are directly damaging assets and causing significant challenges.

Risk and insurance solutions evolve: innovation in peril diagnostics and broad parametric solutions is helping the market better manage volatility and uncertainty.

Renewable innovation gains momentum: emerging technologies such as kinetic infrastructure, solar-integrated materials, nuclear fusion and gravity-based storage demonstrate the continued interest in reshaping the future energy landscape.

Steven Munday, Global Renewable Energy Leader, Willis Natural Resources said: “While global pressures endure, the next wave of innovation continues to push the sector forward into new and uncharted waters, low carbon power generation doesn’t stop with wind and solar. Different regions face intrinsic risks and opportunities, but the renewable energy sector as a whole can step into the future to deliver clarity and confidence.”

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Asia was the primary driver of the 140 per cent global growth of renewable capacity over the past decade, contributing 421.5GW of new capacity. This is 72 per cent of the global total and bringing its cumulative capacity to 2,382 GW or 53.6 per cent of the global share.

The region continues to lead global renewable energy growth, fuelled by rising energy demand, ambitious net-zero targets and the increasing cost-competitiveness of clean technologies. Countries such as China, India, Japan, South Korea and in ASEAN are accelerating the deployment of solar, wind, hydro and emerging technologies, including hybrid installations that integrate batter energy storage systems (BESS) and floating solar photovoltaics (FPV).

Looking ahead, floating solar is expected to play an increasingly important role in expanding Asia’s renewable capacity. With technological innovation, supportive policy frameworks and competing challenges for land use, optimisation of FPV systems is gaining significant traction. In particular, Asean markets are seeing heightened interest, with developers actively participating and government tenders, indicating strong growth potential.

Sam Liu, Head of Renewable Energy, Willis Natural Resources, Asia, said: “FPV projects face technical challenges, especially regarding floater design and the resiliency of anchoring and mooring systems, particularly in sites exposed to natural catastrophes. Site selection is therefore critical, as it directly impacts the overall system design. Extensive technical studies are therefore required to gather accurate environmental data and ensure the project is engineered for long-term performance and durability.

“In general, while new market entrants have increased overall capacity and enhanced competitiveness in the insurance sector, insurers remain highly technical and cautious. This is particularly when underwriting emerging technologies such as BESS, hydrogen, FPV and larger wind turbine models. Capacity remains constrained by factors such as natural catastrophe exposures and the accumulation of insured assets within specific regions. These will continue to influence underwriting appetite and terms for renewable energy companies in Asia.”",https://eco-business.imgix.net/clients/featured_images/Solar_panels-Renewable_energy_review_2025_lower_res.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:09.470597

This funding will aid innovators to invest in the nation, supporting R&D and unlocking capital for zero-emission vehicles and related supply chains.

The programme encompasses a range of funding competitions designed to support UK businesses transitioning to zero-emission vehicle manufacturing, from large-scale gigafactories to start-ups and automotive innovation.

In 2024, the automotive sector contributed £21.4bn in gross value added (GVA) to the UK economy and employed 132,000 people across the country.

The newly announced funding aligns with the government’s goal to increase business investment in advanced manufacturing by 2035.

DRIVE35 will capitalise on past achievements with the Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF) and the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC) R&D competitions, which have previously utilised more than £6bn of private sector investment and generated various jobs.

The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) has earmarked over £300m for certain automotive manufacturing companies and projects, including more than £100m of capital investment for the nation’s automotive manufacturing through the ATF.

DBT, in collaboration with APC UK and Innovate UK, will deliver the programme.

The DRIVE35 programme is said to stimulate economic growth and significantly minimise CO2 emissions.

Business and Trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “We’re taking action to back the industry for the future with the biggest set of announcements for the sector in the last decade.

“This includes securing a landmark trade deal with the US to bring down tariffs for British car manufacturers, measures in our modern Industrial Strategy to lower electricity prices and updating the ZEV mandate, supporting UK manufacturers to safeguard jobs, and secure the future of the sector.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/07/shutterstock_2451038745.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:41.370361

But UK health and safety law does require employers to ensure a “reasonable” temperature.
Workers would be better protected if a set maximum temperature was included in law, she argues.
As well as the TUC, a number of unions have expressed support for a maximum working temperature, including the GMB and the Workers Union.
Productivity drops in the heat In addition to harming the health and wellbeing of workers, heat also has productivity implications.","Trade unions say the UK government and European Commission must introduce a maximum temperature for workers

The UK and much of Europe are having a summer of heatwaves, with temperatures reaching the mid-30s in the UK capital London and into the mid-40s in southern Europe.

Research published by the UK’s national weather service, the Met Office, in June shows the chance of temperatures hitting 40C have been rapidly increasing and are now 20 times more likely than in the 1960s.

With global temperatures rising due to climate change, UK trade unions are calling on businesses to offer better protection for workers during heatwaves.

Working in the heat, especially physically taxing work outdoors, has a number of health impacts. Heat stress is an “invisible killer”, the UN’s International Labour Organization says. Exposure to high temperatures leads to heat exhaustion, sunburn and heat stroke, as well as longer-term health complications such as cardiovascular and respiratory complications, kidney disease and the exacerbation of other conditions.

The UK does not have a maximum temperature for work, despite having a minimum — 16C for indoor work. But UK health and safety law does require employers to ensure a “reasonable” temperature.

If there is a genuine risk to life, employees can also leave the workplace under section 44 of the Employment Rights Act; for example, if those operating heavy machinery feel unwell.

Shelly Asquith, health, safety and wellbeing officer at the Trades Union Congress, a federation of trade unions, sells Sustainable Views that the law is “quite vague and open to interpretation”. Workers would be better protected if a set maximum temperature was included in law, she argues.

The TUC recommends a maximum temperature of 27C for indoor work.

Some workplaces will always be incredibly hot, such as commercial bakeries or furnaces. But in the same way that UK workers in cold storage facilities are not subject to the 16C minimum temperature, Asquith argues that a maximum temperature rule can function with exceptions.

As well as the TUC, a number of unions have expressed support for a maximum working temperature, including the GMB and the Workers Union.

Prior to last year’s election, the Labour party’s Plan to Make Work Pay recognised that “working temperatures are regularly unacceptably high . . . causing serious health and safety concerns”. The plan said the government would modernise health and safety laws on temperature, but since coming into office the government has been quiet on the issue.

No policies on extreme heat are included in the 2024 employment rights bill, the government’s landmark overhaul of workers’ rights.

Heat-related deaths in Europe

The EU also does not mandate a maximum working temperature, but similar to their UK counterparts, European trade unions are calling for more legal protections following deaths in the bloc during the recent heatwave.

Workplace heat-related deaths in the EU have increased by 42 per cent since 2000, says the European Trade Union Confederation.

Meanwhile, research published by Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Human last week found that of 2,300 heat-related deaths in 12 European cities between June 23 and July 2, about 1,500, or 65 per cent, were the result of climate change-induced warming.

The ETUC is urging the European Commission to propose a binding maximum working temperature, while similar debates are ongoing at the national level in a number of European countries.

France does not have a maximum working temperature but its labour law, the “Code du travail”, requires employers to make sure workers are not subject to extreme temperatures that may damage their health. Italy has similar regulations.

French far-right politician Marine Le Pen has called for a “major air-conditioning equipment plan” in light of the recent high temperatures. Writing on X she said public buildings should be air-conditioned as a priority, such as schools and workplaces.

Italy recently banned outdoor work at certain times of the day when the temperature is highest, due to the heatwave.

Meanwhile, Spain and Portugal have mandated maximum temperatures for work in law — between 17C and 27C for sedentary work and 14C to 25C for physical work in Spain and between 18C and 22C for indoor workplaces in Portugal — and German regulations stipulate that employers start taking protective measures once indoor temperatures reach 26C.

Across the Atlantic, former US President Joe Biden proposed a federal workplace standard for extreme heat, but this has since been removed from the US government website. President Donald Trump’s administration has slashed funding for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which would have managed the standard.

Productivity drops in the heat

In addition to harming the health and wellbeing of workers, heat also has productivity implications.

The 2024 edition of scientific journal the Lancet’s annual health and climate report calculates that 512bn work hours were lost in 2023 due to the risk of heat exposure.

Similarly, research by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics shows that a 1C temperature uplift from the long-term average increases the probability of a UK worker reducing their hours by 9.9 per cent and their effort by 9.5 per cent.

“It’s possible that employers don’t really understand just how much heat is harming workers,” Elizabeth Robinson, acting dean and professor of environmental economics at the LSE, tells Sustainable Views. The most vulnerable workers, such as those with pre-existing health conditions, and those operating in sectors with limited regulation such as gig economy workers are at particular risk during heatwaves, she adds.

Employers may be reluctant to invest in adaptation, even though change could bring significant productivity benefits, says Robinson.

Asquith agrees, telling Sustainable Views that heat exposure has long and short-term productivity implications — workers are less productive when working in the heat and may take more sickness leave due to longer-term impacts. Employers should consider heat as part of their risk assessments, in the same way they would for flooding, she says.

In addition to air conditioning in indoor workplaces, there are many measures businesses can take to make employees more comfortable in the heat, including relaxing dress codes or altering hours to avoid people working in peak temperatures, Asquith says.

A May report by UK think-tank the Autonomy Institute also recommends that employers offer more frequent breaks in hot weather, as well as shaded areas and sunscreen for outdoor workers.

Many heat-related adaptations — “facilities with water and maybe air conditioning” — are relatively cheap for businesses, Carter Brandon, senior fellow at think-tank the World Resources Institute, tells Sustainable Views.

The bottom line is that employees should have a right to work in an environment that does not harm their health, Robinson adds.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/e19e2b54-de49-44c3-8e4f-80593986e87b.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:32.819566

Those incentives are set to expire on the shortest timeline of all of the renewable energy credits mentioned in the new law.
Sugar Hollow’s Chief Operating Officer, Clary Franko, said one priority right now is to avoid layoffs among the more than 50 employees who live in the city of Asheville and surrounding rural communities.
At least 271 wind and solar projects slated for development in rural areas in 40 states are affected by the new legislation’s federal tax policy changes.","In the mountains of western North Carolina, local renewable energy company Sugar Hollow Solar is already working through contingency plans to avoid laying off staff.

Despite five new hires coming on board in June to install panels in rural communities throughout the region, circumstances have changed for the Asheville, North Carolina, business after the July 4 signing of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), the signature piece of legislation of President Donald Trump’s second term.

The law includes sweeping cuts to a renewable energy incentive structure established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) under President Joe Biden in 2022. Tax credits for commercial wind and solar projects will phase out five years ahead of schedule, with the 30% rebate accessible only to projects that either break ground by next summer or come online by the end of 2027.

Such changes are expected to increase the cost of electricity by 9.2% across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in the contiguous United States, per an analysis from the National Economic Research Associates commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association. For residential ratepayers in states like Wyoming, Illinois, New Mexico, and Tennessee, the analysis found that electricity costs will rise by more than 15%.

Other parts of the new legislation target IRA-era tax credits available to consumers, such as discounts for home energy improvement projects and electric vehicle purchases. Those incentives are set to expire on the shortest timeline of all of the renewable energy credits mentioned in the new law. Customers wanting to install rooftop solar, electric heat pumps, or home efficiency upgrades have until December 31, 2025, to take advantage of the tax credit, while prospective new and used EV buyers have until September 30, 2025, to claim rebates.

Beyond tax policy, the OBBB Act also rescinds billions of dollars of funding for community-level grants and implementation of a host of climate and emissions-reduction programs with money earmarked for rural communities.

For Sugar Hollow Solar, the cuts will almost surely mean loss of business. Sugar Hollow’s Chief Operating Officer, Clary Franko, said one priority right now is to avoid layoffs among the more than 50 employees who live in the city of Asheville and surrounding rural communities.

“We’ll do our absolute best to maintain stability as a company and keep everybody employed,” said Franko. “It’ll be hard.”

Sugar Hollow is not alone in the challenges it’s facing. Lloyd Ritter is a veteran of federal energy and rural development policy, having worked on Capitol Hill before founding Green Capitol, LLC, a renewable energy consulting firm in Washington, D.C. He told the Daily Yonder that the legislation will negatively affect rural America.

“It’s going to hit rural mom-and-pop energy businesses the hardest,” said Ritter.

Beyond the loss of revenue for small-scale businesses, larger projects planned for development in rural communities are also at risk, a Daily Yonder analysis of Atlas Public Policy data found.

At least 271 wind and solar projects slated for development in rural areas in 40 states are affected by the new legislation’s federal tax policy changes. “New wind and solar projects would have brought investment and job opportunities to rural communities across the country,” wrote Rachel Reolfi, senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, in a statement to the Daily Yonder. “With the new law, many of these projects and their economic benefits are now at risk.”

In order to claim the 30% commercial tax credits for clean electricity production and investment, these planned wind and solar projects must break ground on construction by mid-2026 or come online by December 31, 2027. But for developers of distributed and utility-scale projects with timelines that often span multiple years, this phase-out period is still not much time, despite extending beyond the expiration of the residential credits.

“There will be companies that can’t make it because of project logistics or just lack of support from their investors, or maybe just lack of confidence in the market now,” said Raina Hornaday, general manager and co-founder of Caprock Renewables, a utility-scale developer working across Texas and New Mexico. Texas has many more projects on the line than any other state, with 63 planned solar and wind developments totaling more than 16.6 megawatts of added generating capacity between now and 2031, per the Daily Yonder’s analysis.

Together, the planned wind and solar projects analyzed by the Daily Yonder represent 54.2 gigawatts of renewable generating capacity that, before the passage of the federal budget, were slated to come online in rural communities through the early 2030s. These projects represent enough new generating capacity to power roughly 14 million homes and spur tens of billions in capital investment in their host communities, per estimates made by Atlas Public Policy using parameters from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Amidst the growing need for power supply in the U.S., driven in part by artificial intelligence and energy-intensive data centers coming online, industry experts, including Hornaday and Ritter, told the Daily Yonder they’re concerned about the country’s ability to meet demand under the rollback of renewable energy policy.

“We need more energy, not less, and we shouldn’t be picking winners and losers in that regard,” Ritter said. “Wind and solar have been proven to be rapidly deployable and are making a real dent in the nation’s energy infrastructure.”

As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S.
O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance.
Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance.
""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive.","Nearly every county in the United States has experienced flooding in the past few decades, but just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

It's what experts call the flood insurance gap. Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flooding. And while FEMA aid may be available to help people repair their homes after federally declared disasters, it often covers just a fraction of the costs.

That means when floodwaters come, people frequently are on their own to pick up the pieces. It's a reality communities across the country are facing after flooding hit parts of Texas, New Mexico and North Carolina in the past week alone. In all three states, the floods were caused by extremely heavy rainfall inland — a risk that's growing with climate change. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. As temperatures rise, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time.

One solution: homeowners, renters and businesses can buy flood insurance, which most people get through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change.

Federal flood insurance offers up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for non-residential buildings. People can buy policies that also cover the belongings inside their home, including clothing and furniture. The program is open to anyone who lives in one of the approximately 22,600 communities that have adopted certain standards to regulate development in their floodplains. Porter estimates that people living in more than 90% of U.S. counties are eligible. For people who want flood insurance but live outside of a qualifying community, they would have to go to the private market.

""It's clear that [flood] insurance protects property owners and it protects the communities,"" Porter says. ""It ends up keeping property values from dropping, post-event. It ultimately ends up keeping properties from going into foreclosure.""

In some places, though, federal flood insurance is unaffordable for many residents, and costs are rising around the country.

So, people ""roll the dice, hope [a flood] doesn't happen,"" says Brian O'Connell, an analyst at insuranceQuotes, an online platform where people can compare and buy insurance. ""And when it does happen — and we talk to people who it happens to — it's one of the worst things people ever experience in their lives.""

Some see ""life changing"" flood insurance costs

The U.S. government created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 when private companies stopped offering coverage. The federal program, which is backed by taxpayers, has been chronically in debt, borrowing from the Treasury to pay claims.

Several years ago, FEMA began overhauling how the flood program sets its prices. Now, premiums are based on a home's value, FEMA says, and the flood risk an individual property faces. That's a more granular approach that the government used before. FEMA says one of the goals is to encourage actions that reduce flood risks.

As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S. In Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, for example, where 9 out of 10 homes are at risk of flooding, people are looking at paying more than $5,400 a year for flood insurance, an average increase of more than 500%. That's on top of their regular home insurance costs.

""The guy with a million dollar house, he'll figure it out,"" says Anderson Baker, a retired insurance executive in Louisiana. ""The guy with a $150,000 house, a couple hundred dollars extra a month, or $300 extra a month, that's a life-changing increase in his premium.""

O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance. There are companies that have started to offer flood insurance again, which creates some competition for the federal program, says Porter of First Street. However, private insurers only cover 12% of the market, according to First Street.

For some people, taking on the added expense of flood insurance isn't much of a choice. Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance. Properties that have received federal disaster aid in the past also must be covered by flood insurance to qualify for future assistance. And in Florida, the state-backed insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, has started requiring homeowners that have coverage for wind damage to also buy flood insurance.

If a lot more people bought flood insurance, it would drive down the cost of coverage and could entice more private insurers into the market, says Michelle Osborne, director of the Risk Management Institute at Campbell University.

But as things stand, the cost of flood insurance is often a dealbreaker for people, says O'Connell of insuranceQuotes, especially since many doubt they need protection.

""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive. ""But everybody's in a flood zone. People at the top of a mountain are in a flood zone. They're just in a good flood zone.""

Cenovus Energy, which owns the Superior refinery, has adopted 9 of the 10 recommendations targeted toward the company and its facility.","Four years after an explosion at Wisconsin’s only oil refinery, federal investigators found a lack of safeguards during a maintenance shutdown led to a 2018 blast that injured three dozen workers and prompted a temporary evacuation of Superior residents.

Now, the board that did that investigation is slated for elimination under Republican President Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget.

In its budget request, the White House said the U.S. Chemical Safety Board generates “unprompted studies” and duplicates the work of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Trump repeatedly proposed nixing the agency in his first term. Decades prior, the board’s creation was almost thwarted under Democratic President Bill Clinton in an effort to streamline the federal government. But more recently, even industry groups have opposed its elimination, as have public health and environmental groups.

With cuts to agencies under Trump, Superior Mayor Jim Paine said communities like his need more investigations and more accountability.

“If the CSB had been better funded 10 or 15 years ago, they might have been better able to educate the refinery in Superior about how to prevent the explosion that ended up happening in 2018,” Paine said. “Had that explosion been prevented, not only would people not have been hurt, but the refinery could have saved millions and millions of dollars in that rebuild. These agencies are good for industry.”

The board has about 50 staff members and a budget of roughly $14.4 million. In the last five years, nearly 500 serious chemical incidents have occurred in 43 states. In a June 24 letter, more than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives urged Trump to reverse his calls to close the agency.

Former board member, safety advocates oppose the move

Former board member Rick Engler, who served under President Barack Obama, visited Superior after the refinery explosion. He called Trump’s proposal a “draconian” move and likened the board’s role to the National Transportation Safety Board in that it examines the underlying cause of incidents to prevent future accidents.

“Many parts of industry, and particularly the safety and health professionals within the oil and chemical industries, recognize the value of the CSB in making recommendations and looking at the underlying causes,” Engler said.

Scott Jensen, a spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, said in an email that the industry trade group appreciates Trump’s efforts to ensure taxpayer money is being spent wisely.

“We value the work of the CSB and want to see it continue, and we will continue to engage with the White House and Congress, so they understand we support the CSB,” Jensen wrote.

The board suffered from a staff shortage during Trump’s first term that contributed to a backlog of investigations that was resolved in late 2023. While not required, Engler said many companies adopt the board’s recommendations. The CSB website states 87 percent of its 1,019 recommendations are closed, meaning industry has typically addressed necessary changes.

Cenovus Energy, which owns the Superior refinery, has adopted 9 of the 10 recommendations targeted toward the company and its facility. It must still address certain actions during its next maintenance shutdown in regard to a mechanical integrity program for a key valve that failed, contributing to the explosion. The refinery didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Engler noted closure of recommendations doesn’t necessarily mean safety changes, but he said it’s clear such changes that are adopted lead to safer workplaces and communities around these facilities.

Jordan Barab, a former deputy assistant secretary of OSHA under Obama, said the proposed elimination comes as Trump also plans cuts to OSHA that include reductions for setting standards and slashing the number of inspections by 28 percent from the last fiscal year.

Barab disputed the administration’s claims that CSB duplicates work of agencies, such as OSHA, that issue fines or regulations, noting the board can examine factors beyond violations. That includes evaluating factors like worker fatigue, management’s safety culture and unclear procedures.

“These are all things that neither OSHA nor EPA does,” Barab said.

Henry Anderson, a former state environmental and occupational disease epidemiologist, said states might lack the sophisticated staff or finances to conduct incident investigations on their own.

“If the safety precautions that they normally recommend aren’t made, then that’s [an] opportunity for continuing more outbreaks of severe injury and illness to workers,” Anderson said.

The board’s supporters say taxpayers get a lot for their money.

“If even one major incident is prevented … the CSB investment is well worth it,” Engler said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/enhanced_closeup-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:49.583126

Leah Douglas reports for Reuters.

In short:

A group of 139 EPA workers who signed a letter condemning Trump administration policies were put on leave, prompting union outcry.

The letter accused the agency of ignoring science and dismantling environmental programs, including those supporting environmental justice.

The employees’ union argues the suspension violates free speech rights and federal protections for whistleblowers.

Key quote:

""These employees engaged in protected speech on a matter of significant public concern, and their actions are fully protected by federal law and our collective bargaining agreement.""

— Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238

Why this matters:

Silencing federal scientists and staff for speaking out undermines transparency and trust in public health and environmental protections. The union representing these employees says the agency’s action reeks of political retaliation. These are the people who sounded alarms as climate policy was gutted, as environmental justice programs were shelved, and as public health protections were rolled back with the stroke of a pen. It's causing many to ask: If scientists and regulators can’t criticize the EPA — the very agency tasked with protecting health and the planet — then who will?

But consistently adhering to the public’s desire not to enhance Illinois’ descent into nuclear power is, in truth, a mark of success, not failure.
Today, Illinois has more nuclear power reactors than any other state, and the accumulation of homegrown high-level radioactive waste has continued.
Nuclear energy is an important alternative for a long-term clean energy future but won’t provide either the energy or the carbon emissions reductions we need right now.
Under HB2967, Illinois students who meet GPA thresholds will receive automatic admission to public colleges and universities.","Regarding the op-ed “Illinois needs the nuclear option for our energy needs” (July 7): Pro-nuclear readers like me who are concerned about climate change applaud the well-articulated commentary by Micky Horstman, pushing for more firm nuclear-generated electricity available 24/7 to run artificial intelligence-driven data centers and provide Illinois with “more reliable power to attract tech jobs and avoid blackouts and price spikes.” Another benefit: Cleaner nuclear power will complement the wind and solar energy being added to the grid to reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels that pollute our air and warm our planet.

Horstman laments the fact that our elected representatives in Springfield could not get across the finish line a bill that would have lifted the remaining moratorium on large-scale nuclear reactors.

But all hope is not lost. In 2023, when legislation allowing small modular nuclear reactors limited to 300 megawatts also failed in the regular session, it was taken up again during the veto session, both houses passed it and Gov. JB Pritzker signed it in December of that year.

Let’s ask our representatives in Springfield to use that same playbook on SB1527 — add it to the veto session agenda and get it passed and signed.

Large-scale nuclear power is a vital tool needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure that Illinois does not become dependent on nearby states to fuel our power demands.

Radioactive waste

Micky Horstman feels that Illinois has failed in not “building a real nuclear power plant” for nearly 40 years. But consistently adhering to the public’s desire not to enhance Illinois’ descent into nuclear power is, in truth, a mark of success, not failure.

Today, Illinois has more nuclear power reactors than any other state, and the accumulation of homegrown high-level radioactive waste has continued. A state’s assembly is representative of the people and what they want. Citizens don’t want radioactive waste near their highways and byways. To understate the fact, we don’t want spent nuclear fuel near our kids, our towns, our neighborhoods or our farms — or ourselves!

Free up permitting

Thanks for the op-ed by Micky Horstman. Nuclear energy is an important alternative for a long-term clean energy future but won’t provide either the energy or the carbon emissions reductions we need right now. Climate experts tell us that how well we perform over the next 20 years at reducing fossil fuel emissions will determine how effective we will be at reducing the end-of-century average global temperature. Since Horstman’s first new large-scale nuclear plant probably won’t be seen operating in Illinois before 2050, it’s not a sufficient near-term solution — albeit, it’s an important longer-term consideration.

Wind, solar and geothermal are the near-term clean energy solutions available today that can help us responsibly meet the needs of a country hungry for energy. To ensure we can move quickly to get projects onto the grid, we must enact national permitting reform legislation. Comprehensive permitting reform legislation will help speed up adding transmission capacity, streamlining bureaucratic red tape and addressing judicial reforms to reduce endless court battles. Doing so will assist Illinois in meeting its aggressive clean energy goals.

Readers can ask their U.S. representative to work across the aisle to enact permitting reform legislation to meet America’s growing energy needs in a timely, responsible and cost-effective way.

Helping our students

House Bill 2967, signed by Gov. JB Pritzker last month, will impact thousands of students across our state. As the CEO of Chicago Scholars, I’ve watched the college journeys of thousands of high-achieving students from underresourced communities, and I cannot overstate how needed — and how overdue — this legislation is.

Recently, I sat with a recipient of our program who was at the top of his class, did well on the ACT and wanted to go into finance. But he wasn’t sure he could afford it, whether dual-credit courses would transfer or how to complete the federal aid application. He ultimately enrolled at Illinois State University, a great outcome for him, but his story reflects a broken system that often leaves brilliant students behind.

Every year, we work with hundreds of Scholars: 90% are students of color, and 85% are first-generation college students. Despite the odds, 95% of them matriculate on time, and over 90% persist to their second year. We’ve helped secure more than $700 million in merit-based aid and scholarships. But even with our robust wraparound model, we’re working against structural challenges that no organization can solve alone.

That’s why these new laws matter. Under HB2967, Illinois students who meet GPA thresholds will receive automatic admission to public colleges and universities. This removes ambiguity and boosts confidence. It says to students like the one I’ve mentioned: “You are seen. You belong here.”

HB2967 does more to ensure that those automatic admissions lead to more degrees earned by Illinoisians. Requiring that every Illinois high school assign a federal aid application point person and give students time to complete it at school levels the playing field. Clearer transfer credit standards will prevent the frustration I see every year from Scholars whose credits didn’t count at college. Ultimately, more students will get the aid and credit they have earned.

We are living through a convergence of crises: an affordability crisis, an equity crisis and a trust crisis in higher education. Across the country, attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion threaten progress. But Illinois just did something different. We chose to believe in students and invest in their futures.

Rules of the road

Isn’t it time for the Chicago Police Department and the Chicago Department of Transportation to mount a public information campaign to answer the following questions:

Which vehicles, if any, may use the sidewalks? Which vehicles may use the bike lanes? Are motorized bikes permitted in the bike lanes? Are motorized scooters permitted in the bike lanes? Are motorized unicycles permitted in the bike lanes? When does a motorized bike become a motorcycle? Even with small wheels? What do the various road paintings mean? Where do cars and buses share the red painted lanes? Where do cars and other vehicles share the green painted lanes? And how is the sharing to be accomplished?

And, most importantly, who must obey the rules of the road such as stopping at stop signs and who may use their own discretion?

The rules are unclear and unenforced.

Art Institute service

I do not disagree with the way columnist Laura Washington views the physical look of the Art Institute, which will never change (“The Art Institute is slowly getting back to normal,” July 9). But for me and several hundred fellow volunteers, the museum has profoundly changed.

For 27 years, I did my once-a-week stint at the public contact desks, including at the front and rear entrances. The desks have been removed, and we have not been called back as we had been told at the start of the pandemic.

I miss my time as a volunteer. We were never thanked for our service when it was over.

It was always a pleasure to represent such a fine institution and to help visitors enjoy their visit.

Similar to LG&E in Kentucky, Georgia Power Company is seeking permission to build new gas-fired power plants that will generate more than a gigawatt of power, largely due to a forecasted data center boom.","The largest electric utility company in Kentucky has an expensive plan to construct and upgrade power plants to significantly increase its energy load over the next seven years — mostly due to the demands of new data centers it expects will be built in that time.

Critics say the utility company may be moving too fast, as data centers remain speculative in Kentucky and may not end up consuming the staggering amount of power being forecast. If that happens, they fear current customers may be the ones picking up the tab of the new plants in the form of higher rates.

Kentucky now finds itself in part of the national context of electric utility companies figuring out how to adapt to projections of data center power demand skyrocketing in the coming years. This includes skepticism from some state utility regulators and experts about how realistic those forecasts are, and the risk of spending billions of dollars on new power generation if such data center demand ends up being overestimated.

Louisville Gas and Electric (LG&E) and Kentucky Utilities (KU) filed a case with the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) in February seeking approval to spend $3.7 billion to significantly increase its power generation capacity. Three-quarters of that spending would go to building two new 645 megawatt natural gas power plants — one in Louisville, one in Mercer County — in addition to a new battery storage system in Louisville and upgrades to keep an old coal-fired power plant operating in Carroll County.

The company’s filings with the state’s utility regulator indicate this additional power generation would allow it meet the forecasted 29% increase of seasonal peak demand by 2032 — rising from just more than 6 gigawatts currently, to roughly 8 gigawatts.

Nearly all of LG&E’s projected growth in load demand is due to large economic development projects it expects to come — mostly that of massive data centers, which are facilities housing computer servers that store and process data for services like cloud storage, streaming platforms and artificial intelligence.

In PSC filings and testimony over the past several months, the utility indicated it expected the energy demand of new data centers to reach 1,750 megawatts — or 1.75 gigawatts — by 2032. That’s considerably more than the second phase of the massive electric vehicle battery plant In Glendale that’s expected to use 120 megawatts when it comes online in 2028.

John Bevington, an executive with PPL Services Co., the parent company of LG&E and KU, stated in PSC testimony that “without certainty of available generation and transmission capacity, it will be difficult to fulfill the initiatives of the General Assembly and Gov. (Andy) Beshear in marketing Kentucky to data centers and other large load customers.”

LG&E expects this rise in data center demand due to new statewide tax incentives passed by the Kentucky legislature this year that seek to lure companies to the state, as well as more than a dozen inquiries they’ve received by companies expressing an interest in locating one there — altogether totaling more than 6 gigawatts.

This included two of the massive “hyperscale” data center projects announced early this year — a 400 megawatt project in Louisville and a 600 megawatt complex in neighboring Oldham County.

But the example of Oldham County shows the risks of utilities basing billions of dollars in new power plant construction based on speculation of new data center demand that may or may not come to fruition — a risk that state regulators, utilities and customers all across the country are taking a closer look at.

Critics say inflated demand could lead to ‘stranded asset’

Following a local uproar of opposition to the Oldham County project, the company behind it scrapped its plans for a 600 megawatt data center, instead announcing it would build a 100 megawatt facility on a smaller property. When the opposition progressed into the passage of a countywide moratorium on data center projects, World Hospitality Partners announced it would abandon all plans to build one in Oldham.

Byron Gary, an attorney for environmental advocacy group Kentucky Resources Council, says this highlights the speculative nature of data center load demand that is the basis for LG&E’s infrastructure buildout. If these data centers don’t materialize as hoped, his fear is that the expensive new plants “become a stranded asset that everybody ends up having to pay for.”

Gary says utility companies typically use private equity and bonds to build power plants, and then recoup those funds through charges to ratepayers. How LG&E specifically charges ratepayers to recover the $3.7 billion would have to be formally requested by the utility in a PSC case, which the regulator could approve or deny.

In PSC filings and testimony, LG&E officials have identified 18 data center “opportunities,” in which companies have requested information about the feasibility of a specific site in Kentucky. The utility does not have to name who made the requests, but they are categorized in five different stages based on how close they are to going forward.

Gary noted that none of these are at the final stage of having a signed contract for service and only one — likely the announced Louisville project — was deemed “imminent,” with the company having all of the information it needs, but still finalizing business plans before proceeding. The rest are still in the lower stages of inquiry, suspect and prospect, in which companies are still gathering information and evaluating sites.

Gary said the likelihood of those 17 other data center “opportunities” actually happening “is really uncertain, as we've seen with Oldham County.” He noted that Western Hospitality Partners of the Oldham project and the companies behind the Louisville data center are not the actual end users that would operate it, as they are developers setting up “colocation facilities” that they would then lease out to potential tech companies for use, such as Amazon, Meta or Google.

With real estate developers likely making inquiries about sites in multiple states in order to land an agreement, build a facility or get connected to the grid, he says this is likely inflating the overall forecast of data center demand in Kentucky and throughout the country.

“If we build two new power plants to serve a data center and Pennsylvania manages to get theirs online first, then we could end up being just out of luck and eating the cost of a new power plant for a data center that doesn't come,” Gary said.

This concern of duplicative inquiries was also raised in PSC motions and testimony from the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the case.

“Service territory shopping, when data center developers are in conversations with multiple utilities across a number of states, is standard practice,” a Sierra Club motion stated. “Since (LG&E and KU) appear to lack any barriers to entry to the load interconnection queue, it’s possible that inquiries are coming from customers who have no intention of constructing data centers themselves and are merely attempting to hold a place in line.”

An LG&E map of data center opportunities shows most are located in Jefferson and Oldham counties, along with one in Mercer County, one in Mason County and at least one in Bell County.

State regulators, stakeholders taking closer look at data center forecasts

The concern that utilities may be overbuilding power generation due to inflated forecasts of data center demands is shared by credit ratings agencies — a key player in the financing of construction.

Last year, both Moody’s and Fitch warned that inaccurate load increase forecasts for data centers could create credit risks for utility companies.

Beyond just site speculation, Fitch warned that actual demand may turn out to be lower than projected “because of technological changes and efficiency improvements that lower the power requirements for data centers.” Without tariff schedules, rates and contracts that protect other ratepayers, “there is considerable risk that residential customers may end up paying disproportionately for the significant investments needed to connect the large, new commercial loads.”

Todd Snitchler, the CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, also warned in an op-ed this year that artificial intelligence-driven data center forecasts are succumbing to “irrational exuberance,” risking the overbuilding of power infrastructure that will burden current ratepayers.

Just like fears of digital commerce using excessive power at the turn of the century turned out to be unfounded due to technological advances in efficiency, some expect the same to happen with data centers. For example, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek announced this year that it had replicated other AI models while consuming only a fraction of the energy.

Stakeholders are closely following the potential overestimation of data center demand in Texas, which consumes more power than any other state, by far.

Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the operator of the state’s electrical grid, recently unveiled what its CEO Pablo Vegas called a “sanity check” on power demand forecast driven by the data center boom.

Peak energy demand was forecast to grow from 85 gigawatts to 208 gigawatts by 2030, but ERCOT adjusted this down to 148 gigawatts when it changed its methodology for anticipated growth in data centers. The state operator examined how many anticipated data centers actually came to fruition and adjusted the percentage of upcoming projects, cutting the forecasted power demand of data centers in half.

Vegas said previous estimates were inflated because of the market race of developers attempting to land multiple sites across the country, in the hopes of landing one and preparing it for a large end user, like Microsoft or Apple.

Similar to LG&E in Kentucky, Georgia Power Company is seeking permission to build new gas-fired power plants that will generate more than a gigawatt of power, largely due to a forecasted data center boom. However, Microsoft — which now operates three data centers in Georgia, with plans for more — argues data center demand is inflated by speculative developers, in addition to requesting more reliance on renewable energy instead of burning fossil fuels.

In Ohio, state regulators approved a settlement with American Electric Power Company and other stakeholders that would require data centers to pay for at least 85% of the energy they claim they will consume each month, even if they wind up using less. This is seen as a safeguard in case data centers use much less power than forecast, ensuring they bear the brunt of costs for new utility infrastructure and not other ratepayers.

In Indiana, an American Electric Power affiliate entered a settlement agreement earlier this year with utility regulators and stakeholders on amended tariff terms for data centers. It would apply to a new or expanded facility using at least 70 megawatts — or multiple sites of the same company using 150 megawatts — setting up a specific rate formula for those large load customers.

Gary of Kentucky Resources Council says new data centers in Kentucky could either use the existing large load rate in the current PSC tariff — which does not specifically apply to data centers — or enter into a special contract that would need PSC approval.

He also notes that LG&E has just filed a new case with the PSC to adjust its tariff schedule, creating a new category of “Extremely High Load Factor Service” that resembles portions of the Ohio agreement. The utility also has an ongoing report filed with the PSC last year that outlines its expected energy plans over the next 15 years, which the regulators will make recommendations for.

Even if the PSC does approve a new tariff scheme for data centers that is protective of consumers, Gary warned that may not do much good for ratepayers if data centers don’t actually materialize in the state and fund the recouping of expenses for new power plants — should the PSC give them permission to build them.

“If nobody comes and takes advantage of that tariff, then it seems like there's a possibility that the rest of the rate payers could end up holding the bag for this stranded asset,” Gary said.

Kentucky Resources Council and the Sierra Club also take issue with LG&E plan to build out power with two new gas plants and lengthening the life of a coal-fired plant, arguing that building out more fossil fuel infrastructure instead of renewables will contribute to the escalating climate change crisis.

There is a public comment hearing in Louisville on Monday for the LG&E case requesting PSC approval to build out $3.7 billion of power generating infrastructure.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In Louisiana, natural gas—a planet-heating fossil fuel—is now, by law, considered “green energy” that can compete with solar and wind projects for clean energy funding. The law, signed by Republican Governor Jeff Landry last month, comes on the heels of similar bills passed in Ohio, Tennessee, and Indiana. What the bills have in common—besides an “updated definition” of a fossil fuel as a clean energy source—is language seemingly plucked straight from a right-wing think tank backed by oil and gas billionaire and activist Charles Koch.

Louisiana’s law was based on a template created by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative organization that brings legislators and corporate lobbyists together to draft bills “dedicated to the principles of limited government, free markets and federalism.” The law maintains that Louisiana, in order to minimize its reliance on “foreign adversary nations” for energy, must ensure that natural gas and nuclear power are eligible for “all state programs that fund ‘green energy’ or ‘clean energy’ initiatives.”

But natural gas, also known as methane gas, is no more natural than any other fossil fuel. Its primary ingredient is methane, an intense heat-trapping gas that is far more potent than the carbon pollution produced by coal and oil, though it doesn’t stay in the atmosphere as long.

It’s often marketed as a “bridge fuel”—a less harmful fossil fuel that can be used as communities transition away from coal—but studies have found that over the long term, the planet-warming impact of the natural gas industry may be equivalent to that of coal. That’s because gas pipelines often leak; according to an Environmental Defense Fund analysis, natural gas pipelines in the US allow between 1.2 million and 2.6 million tons of methane to escape into the atmosphere each year.

Louisiana state Rep. Jacob Landry first introduced a near-identical bill to the model posted on ALEC’s website and to the other bills that have passed in Ohio, Tennessee, and Indiana. (The Washington Post reported in 2023 that ALEC was involved in Ohio’s bill; ALEC denies involvement.) Landry, who represents a small district in the southern part of the state, is the recipient of significant fossil fuel-industry funding—and he co-owns two oil and gas consulting firms himself. During his campaign for the state Legislature, Landry received donations from at least 15 fossil-fuel-affiliated companies and PACs, including ExxonMobil (which has also funded ALEC) and Phillips 66. Those donations alone totaled over $20,000.

Landry did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ALEC did not get back to Grist in time for publication.

While Louisiana has one of the least reliable grids in the country, that lack of reliability is in large part due to the state’s reliance on natural gas, which provides most of its electricity, according to a 2025 report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office. “Best practices have found that gas plants are susceptible to large-scale failures during extreme weather,” the auditors wrote. “Diversifying the energy sources used for electricity generation is a priority.”

Bills that benefit both the fossil fuel industry and the individual lawmakers who introduce them aren’t exactly a new genre in Louisiana, said Laura Peterson, a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. What’s less standard is that this one is dressed up in climate-friendly language.

“Louisiana is a classic example of a captured state,” Peterson said. “Their state economy is just so dependent on fossil fuels and petrochemicals.” (The amount of money the fossil fuel industry brings to Louisiana’s people, though, has been on the decline since the turn of the century.)

The state accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s natural gas production and holds about 6 percent of U.S. natural gas reserves. Natural gas is already used to generate about three-quarters of the state’s electricity, and building out more pipeline projects to carry liquefied natural gas, or LNG, won’t necessarily make electricity bills cheaper for residents, Peterson said.

“Building LNG infrastructure is not going to lower anyone’s energy prices in the short term,” since it takes many years to build a pipeline, Peterson said. “And there’s a lot of research that shows that overreliance on gas leaves power grids vulnerable to extreme weather, which Louisiana has a lot of.”

Jeffrey Clark, president of the Louisiana Advanced Power Alliance—an industry group representing both renewable and fossil fuel energy companies and investors—testified in opposition to the bill in early June.

“This legislation is being promoted as a solution to Louisiana’s reliability challenges. But with all due respect, it is a solution in search of a problem,” Clark said. “We support fossil fuels as a key part of the nation’s energy mix, but codifying them as the only acceptable path forward dismisses a growing body of evidence that grid reliability depends on resource diversity.”

Fossil fuel advocacy groups lauded the move. Larry Behrens of the nonprofit Power the Future wrote that the legislation turns Louisiana into an “energy sanctuary state,” taking “a direct shot at the China-backed solar and wind lobby.”

Reclassifying natural gas as “green” energy means that proposed natural gas pipelines may be able to access funding that would otherwise have gone to new solar or wind projects; it may also make natural gas companies more appealing to environmentally conscious investors.

ALEC, the right-wing think tank that provided the template language for Landry’s bill, noted in a press release that resolutions like this could pave the way for more AI data centers in the state, too. “Redefining ‘green energy’ allows utilities to continue using natural gas while fulfilling state ‘green energy’ or ‘clean energy’ initiatives,” ALEC staffer Mark Lucas wrote.

Over the years, ALEC has succeeded in getting laws that benefit fossil fuel companies passed across the country. Recently the group, which was founded in the 1970s, has helped draft legislation criminalizing grassroots protest against pipelines, gas terminals, and other fossil fuel infrastructure—versions of that bill had passed in 17 states by 2022. Its members have also drafted bills aiming to punish economic boycotts of the oil industry. And there are currently 114 different model policies related to energy on ALEC’s website, 23 of which specifically address “green energy.”

“It’s classic greenwashing, right?” said Peterson of the new Louisiana law—using the language of sustainability to describe an activity that’s actually not sustainable at all. “The intent of these laws is to allow the build-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, which will perpetuate the use of fossil fuels for decades to come.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250711-gasplant.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-14 07:20:37.762008

If highly reactive hydrofluoric acid (HF) was released from the Delaware County refinery, it could form a ground-hugging cloud extending up to 17 miles and affecting as many as 1.9 million people in addition to delicate ecosystems nearby. HF attacks the human body causing burns, organ damage and death, a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claims.

The Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California-based Communities for a Better Environment are suing the EPA in federal court, asking a judge to order the agency to reassess its regulations on the chemical.

Filed last Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the suit follows the EPA’s rejection of a petition by the groups asking the agency to eliminate unreasonable risks from the use of HF at oil refineries. An EPA spokesperson said the agency has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation.

HF is used to increase the octane rating of gasoline during the refining process. The groups argue in their lawsuit that more than 40 oil refineries across the country still use HF despite the availability of safer alternatives. The chemical also presents a hazard as it is transported by truck and rail from the only plant where it is manufactured, in Louisiana.

“Needlessly risking release of this extremely hazardous chemical in our densely-packed region where so many people could be injured or killed is reckless. All the other refineries in Pennsylvania manage to use safer alternatives,” Clean Air Council Executive Director Alex Bomstein said in a statement.

Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Airlines, is not a defendant in the lawsuit, which also details the risks to populations surrounding refineries that use HF in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas.

A spokesperson for Monroe said the safe operation of the refinery is of paramount importance and the plant’s alkylation unit, where HF is used, is constantly inspected. The company has invested millions of dollars in safety systems for the unit, spokesperson Matt McGlaughlin said.

“Monroe Energy has a robust safety culture and a strong safety record that reflects this, having received numerous accolades for our safety performance over the years,” McLaughlin said, noting they include awards from the state and industry groups.

Delaware County spokesperson Ryan Herlinger said the county’s Hazardous Materials Response Team is prepared to respond to a release of HF from the Monroe Energy refinery.

“Delaware County takes the risks associated with HF seriously and maintains the resources, training, and protocols necessary to respond effectively and support our communities,” Herlinger said.

Composed of a single hydrogen and a single fluorine atom, both highly reactive elements by themselves, HF can cause respiratory problems and skin burns in lower concentrations. At higher levels, the chemical can cause gruesome and often fatal injuries by dissolving skin, muscle and bone.

“Poison acid clouds engulfing refinery communities and transit corridors sounds like a horror movie, but it’s a real possibility as long as EPA refuses to engage,” Matthew Tejada, senior vice president of environmental health at NRDC, said.

The lawsuit lists numerous releases of HF that caused injuries, including a 1987 incident in which a cloud of acid blanketed a Texas neighborhood. But south Philadelphia was the site of a near miss that could have had catastrophic consequences.

In the wee hours of June 21, 2019, a fire and massive explosion rocked the Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery, hurling massive pieces of equipment hundreds of yards, with some landing on the other side of the Schuylkill River. More than 5,000 pounds of HF were released along with propane and other refining byproducts.

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found the cause of the blast was a 50-year-old section of pipe that ruptured and released liquid propane into the alkylation unit where HF was being used. The Trump administration’s budget for next year eliminates funding for the board, effectively shutting it down.

“A heroic worker was able to divert most of the refinery’s HF inventory — 339,000 pounds — to underground tanks, helping prevent an even greater catastrophe,” the lawsuit says, noting the incident injured five refinery workers and one firefighter, but damaged the plant so badly it never reopened.

Annie Fox, a Clean Air Council employee who works with residents in Trainer, Marcus Hook and other communities around the Monroe Energy plant, said the plant has health impacts on people who live “literally across the street.”

On Thursday, people in Delaware County reported a strong odor of sulfur or gasoline after a power failure forced an emergency shut down of parts of the plant. A towering flame and column of black smoke were emitted from the refinery’s flare stack, videos on social media showed.

“That is one of the reasons why Trainer is representative of the refineries across the country that still use HF,” Fox said.

She added that the recent closure of Crozer-Chester Medical Center means that the nearest emergency room is at least 20 minutes away and people say they have little guidance on what to do in a serious emergency.

“They’re not putting out emergency response plans. They’re not educating the medical personnel,” Fox said. “One resident who has lived there her entire life said they used to do very serious drills if there was an explosion there.”

According to the NRDC, the Trainer refinery has had five releases of HF since 1990, although only one happened since Monroe Energy took ownership of the plant in 2012 and none affected members of the public. In 2019, eight employees were exposed to HF during maintenance; five required hospitalization.

McGlaughlin, the Monroe Energy spokesperson, said the company has worked closely for years with the Delaware County Local Emergency Planning Committee and hospitals to provide information about what to do in the event of an HF release.

The county haz-mat team is certified by the state to handle highly hazardous chemical releases and equipped with specialized tools to detect such materials, including HF. Members of the team receive specialized training in HF response and carry a supply of the front-line treatment for exposure, Herlinger, the county spokesperson, said.

Monroe Energy also conducts joint training with local fire companies, including hazardous materials response.

DOE to halt wind transmission line: US senator

Houston, 11 July (Argus) — President Donald Trump's administration has pledged to halt an 800-mile transmission line designed to deliver wind power from Kansas to eastern states, according to a US senator. US energy secretary Chris Wright has said he ""will be putting a stop"" to the Grain Belt Express transmission line, senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) said on Thursday via the X social media platform. Hawley has made repeated calls for the Department of Energy (DOE) to cancel a $4.9bn conditional loan awarded to the project in the waning days of former president Joe Biden's administration. The senator has called the project an ""elitist land grab harming Missouri farmers and ranchers"". Whether Wright pledged to rescind the loan or take other action to stop work on Grain Belt Express was not immediately clear from Hawley's statement. Neither the senator's office nor DOE immediately responded to requests for additional information. Hawley's statement is ""bizarre"", according to Invenergy, the Chicago-based developer behind the project. The company said that the transmission line has already received approvals from all four states that it will traverse, acquired 1,500 agreements with landowners tied to construction and announced ""significant"" supply chain agreements for materials sourced domestically. ""Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in US history, which is already approved by four states and is aligned with the president's energy dominance agenda,"" the company said. The Grain Belt Express would deliver wind power from Kansas to converter stations in Missouri and Indiana, with the Missouri station connecting to grids overseen by the Associated Electric Cooperative and Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), while the Indiana station links with the PJM Interconnection. Invenergy plans to build the project in two phases, with the first delivering 2,500MW into Missouri and the second ferrying another 2,500MW to the PJM region, which includes the District of Columbia and 13 states in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic. DOE in November 2024 awarded the project a conditional loan of up to $4.9bn to help finance the initial stage as part of Biden's larger push to decarbonize the electricity sector. Invenergy intends to start construction on the first phase next year. Ultimately, the line would supply 15mn MWh/yr to Missouri, with 60pc of the capacity allocated to MISO and the remainder to the Associated Electric Cooperative. Another 15mn MWh/yr would flow into the PJM markets. Altogether, the line would supply enough electricity to cover the demand of more than 2.8mn households. Landowner groups in Missouri have long targeted the Grain Belt Express, but have failed to stymie the project through a challenge to its use of eminent domain . Opponents have since continued their efforts against the project, and Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey, a Republican, last week called on state utility regulators to rescind the line's permit on grounds that Invenergy relied on ""deceptive"" information to secure its approval.

This is because of the reconciliation bill passed earlier this month, which states that solar PV and wind projects will need to begin construction within 12 months of the bill’s enactment in order to retain its “commence construction” date as a safe harbour to receive investment tax credits and production tax credits.

This would allow projects to maintain eligibility until the 2030s, while projects beginning construction after 4 July 2026 will need to be commissioned by the end of 2027 in order to get access to the incentives. However, whether even these terms will be available to developers remains to be seen as US president Donald Trump signed an executive order days later seeking to limit access to solar deployment subsidies, which would target solar PV and wind projects that begin construction within that 12-month period.

Not only will solar PV and wind projects need to start construction in the coming months in order to receive the tax incentives, but they will also be impacted by the foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirement. This will limit access to equipment from prohibited foreign entities such as Chinese-backed manufacturers, explained WoodMac. This will come into play for projects that begin construction starting from 1 January 2026.

Moreover, on a 10-year basis, solar PV installations are forecast to slow down by 17% compared to WoodMac’s previous base-case forecast. With the removal of the tax credits, the installed volume could be as low as 375GWac in the next ten years.

Regarding the fate of clean energy manufacturing, David Brown, director, energy transition research at Wood Mackenzie, said: “Without permitting reform, new large load tariffs and domestic technology innovation, the US will risk the edge it has in the global AI race.

“The early sunset of manufacturing tax credits will lower future energy demand from clean energy manufacturing, while delays to new supply could slow data center rollouts nationwide as facilities compete for scarce grid capacity.”

Energy storage affected by FEOC

The growth of energy storage in the coming years will also be affected, despite its tax credits remaining for longer than solar PV and wind. According to Wood Mackenzie, the central problem for energy storage be the FEOC requirement, due to the sector’s heavy reliance on Chinese supply chains.

As is expected to happen with PV, this could drive a rush of energy storage projects starting construction in the upcoming months, as Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF), told our sister site, Energy-storage.news.

Furthermore, the looming threat of more tariffs imposed to several countries could also have an impact on the supply chain. According to Ben Boucher, a senior analyst in Wood Mackenzie’s Market Intelligence Group, the most consequential change is the increased copper tariff (up to 50%), with wires and cable manufacturing among the hardest hit. That tariff alone could drive US prices of copper up by more than 8%.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/solar-panels-and-wind-turbines-Image_Gerry-Machen-via-flickr.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 06:10:58.743416

Jeremy Lindenfeld reports for Capital & Main.

In short:

Trump’s administration is considering reforms that would make it harder for states to qualify for FEMA assistance and cap how much of the recovery costs the agency will cover, threatening California’s ability to respond to worsening natural disasters.

FEMA has already rescinded nearly $900 million in disaster-preparedness grants, including wildfire prevention funds in Napa County, and delayed disbursing key emergency management grants with no public explanation.

With California’s $12 billion budget deficit and rising disaster frequency, state and local officials say they can’t replace lost federal funding, even as some FEMA payouts for individuals remain minimal or are simply denied.

Key quote:

“They’re just cutting these projects even though they have proven benefit cost analyses in place.”

— Laurie Schoeman, senior adviser on climate resilience to former President Joe Biden

Why this matters:

Climate-fueled disasters are growing more frequent, intense, and expensive. In California, wildfires now destroy entire neighborhoods, displace tens of thousands, and strain public systems for years after the flames are out. FEMA has long helped states shoulder the burden, covering a major share of disaster response and recovery costs.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.wzzm13.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:46.584407

Analytical limits describe the lowest concentration at which a chemical can be found in the environment.
For inorganic and most organic chemicals, the analytical limits are low enough to detect them at all concentrations that affect aquatic organisms.
As a result, some concentration ranges that are associated with risks for aquatic organisms cannot be captured, and potential effects on the ecosystem remain undetected.","Several hundred thousand chemicals are considered as potentially environmentally relevant. Scientists from the RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau in Germany show that monitoring data for surface waters are only available for a very small fraction of these chemicals. In their article, published in the latest issue of Science, the authors also demonstrate that the environmental risks of highly toxic chemicals might be overlooked, because these chemicals affect ecosystems at concentrations that cannot be detected on a regular basis.

“We analyzed a very extensive US database for the presence of chemicals in the US surface waters and compared it with the toxicity data of these chemicals for aquatic organisms, such as plants, insects or fish”, says Ralf Schulz, environmental scientist from Landau and senior author of the article. “This way, we could assess how the dataset reflects chemical risks of the last six decades.”

According to the article, the major problem for comprehensive risk evaluations today is the insufficient chemical coverage of monitoring. Only less than 1% of the 300,000 chemicals, which the US Environmental Protection Agency lists as potentially environmentally relevant, has been in fact monitored.

The article reveals interesting patterns by linking 64 million monitoring records for 1,900 chemicals, 300,000 sites and the time span from 1958 to 2019 with toxicity thresholds indicating risks for aquatic organisms. For example, it shows increased numbers of threshold exceedances throughout the US in 1970s for a relatively small number of chemicals, including heavy metals, such as copper, lead and zinc. But it also shows that the subsequent measures for emission control led to a decline of threshold exceedances of these inorganic chemicals.

The article reveals interesting patterns by linking 64 million monitoring records for 1,900 chemicals, 300,000 sites and the time span from 1958 to 2019 with toxicity thresholds indicating risks for aquatic organisms

In the 2000s, another peak of threshold exceedances can be observed, but this time spread out over a much larger number of mainly organic chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. The number of the exceedances has dropped since then, too. However, because the monitoring of these chemicals was stopped, it is not possible to state whether the environmental risks of these chemicals decreased as well. “If you stop monitoring a problematic chemical, you lose the capability to track its actual presence in the environment. Without the monitoring information, it becomes very hard to understand how potential risks are developing”, comments Sascha Bub, environmental scientist and lead author of the article.

The article also presents the evaluation of 37 million records of analytical limits from the US database. Analytical limits describe the lowest concentration at which a chemical can be found in the environment. For inorganic and most organic chemicals, the analytical limits are low enough to detect them at all concentrations that affect aquatic organisms. However, for some pesticides, and especially some insecticides, typical analytical limits are not sufficient to cover all concentrations that are associated with risks, because their analytical limits are close to their toxicity thresholds. As a result, some concentration ranges that are associated with risks for aquatic organisms cannot be captured, and potential effects on the ecosystem remain undetected. One group of insecticides, pyrethroids, which play an important role in today’s agricultural practice and belong to the most toxic chemicals for aquatic organisms, has conspicuous analytical limits that are almost entirely above the toxicity thresholds. The actual environmental risk of pyrethroids can, therefore, only be assessed to a very limited extent.

According to the authors of the article, their results can presumably be transferred to many other regions of the world. However, the data for the conduction of similar analyses is most often missing. Sascha Bub emphasizes: “Our results illustrate the importance of analyzing the environmental data on large temporal and spatial scales. We need such analyses to be able to guide the monitoring and assessment of the rapidly increasing number of chemicals in use.”",https://smartwatermagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/share-fb-830x436/public/rptu_karin_hiller.jpg?itok=FtMM68_q,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:27.377473

The directive issued by Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh applies to the area inside and along the main ring road that encircles the center of Hanoi. The local government has been tasked with phasing out the two-wheelers by the deadline.

Like the rest of Vietnam, motorcycles are the main mode of transport for most of Hanoi’s 8 million residents. The city has nearly 7 million motorcycles and just over a million cars. But as incomes rise and more people switch to private vehicles, air pollution from traffic has become a growing concern. Hanoi is often enveloped in thick smog, ranking among the most polluted cities worldwide.

Vietnam also wants to switch from fossil-fuel to electric vehicles to cut pollution and tackle climate change. Local EV maker VinFast is leading the shift by holding nearly a fifth of the market share, according to the European Chamber of Commerce. But it still has only a small share of the two-wheeler market.

But many are concerned about the unclear plan for phasing out the vehicles.

Nguyen Van Hung, 62, has spent three decades driving a motorcycle taxi in Hanoi, now working with Grab, a ride-hailing app widely used across Southeast Asia. He worries the ban will hit the working class hardest. “It will affect people who rely on motorbikes to earn a living,” he said, pointing to delivery drivers, commuters and ride-hailing services. “How can people just discard their vehicles?”

Others said that the timeline was unrealistic. Hoang Duy Dung, 32, an office clerk who works in the city center, said he supports cleaner air but believes it is too soon. “We need better public transport and more support before such a big change.”

Central Hanoi is home to much of the city’s business activity, including offices, government buildings and commercial hubs.

A second phase, set to begin in January 2028, will expand the ban to a wider area and include all fossil-fuel two-wheelers, while also restricting some gasoline-powered cars.

Other measures include upgrading waste-treatment plants, using digital tools to monitor pollution and introducing stricter penalties for violators. Whistleblowers could be rewarded for reporting environmental breaches.

In short:

A Boston Consulting Group analysis finds a €250 billion shortfall in planned European power grid investments from 2025 to 2029, despite a planned tripling of capital expenditures to €345 billion.

Demand is being driven by electrification, data centers, AI growth, renewables integration, and aging infrastructure, even as recent blackouts in Spain, Portugal, and the Czech Republic raise concerns about grid resilience.

Transmission system operators are facing financial strain, with rising debt loads and limited access to equity markets, and will need to bridge the gap through debt, asset sales, or reduced shareholder payouts.

Why this matters:

Europe is pushing hard to decarbonize by adding renewable energy sources, yet those clean electrons won’t matter if the wires can’t carry them where they’re needed. Add in rising demand from electric vehicles, heat pumps, and data centers powered by AI, and the pressure on outdated infrastructure grows.

Key takeaway #1

Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance. Ensuring that substantiation and documentation requirements are met at the outset will allow for better results during an IRS examination. Tax credit buyers and investors should continue to carefully diligence projects to ensure that energy tax credit requirements are met.

Key takeaway #2

While the focus of the July 7th EO and promises made in connection with the passages of the Act appear to focus on the new requirements set forth in the Act, the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit tax years dating back to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 remains open, so taxpayers should ensure that they have audit files at the ready to prepare for possible IRS enforcement activity.

On July 4th, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""Act""), which included a phaseout of incentives for solar and wind generation projects. Projects must either begin construction within one year or be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit or the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit. The House's version of the legislation required a more accelerated phaseout than the Act and only allowed projects that began construction within 60 days of enactment of the bill to be eligible for the tax credits. In discussions last week with House conservatives who favored the faster phaseout of solar and wind tax credits, which was not adopted in the Act, President Trump promised strict enforcement of the rules, including the beginning of construction requirements, for solar and wind projects to qualify for energy tax credits.

On July 7th, President Trump issued an Executive Order (""EO"") titled ""Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources. In the EO, the Trump Administration directs the Treasury Secretary to ""take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities"" within 45 days following the enactment of the Act.

Beginning of Construction Rules

Specifically, the EO directs the Treasury Department to issue new and revised guidance for the beginning of construction requirements, which it states should prevent the ""artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility"" and ""restrict the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

Many House conservatives disfavor the current IRS guidance provisions: the Five Percent Safe Harbor and the Physical Work Test. The Five Percent Safe Harbor allows energy projects to demonstrate ""beginning of construction"" by incurring at least five percent of the total project cost, even if the project isn't completed within the same tax year. The Physical Work Test allows a taxpayer to establish ""beginning of construction"" by beginning physical work of a significant nature.

These ""beginning of construction"" tests are set forth in IRS Notices. Because IRS Notices are informal guidance and not formal guidance, the IRS may withdraw, amend, or issue notices at any time. Taxpayers may rely on the existing IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59, both specifically referenced in the Act, until Treasury and the IRS withdraw and/or issue new guidance.

The ""beginning of construction"" rules are important not only to retain eligibility for the credits past the termination date for the credit, but also to determine whether a project must meet the foreign entity of concern requirements set forth in the Act.

Foreign Entity of Concern Requirements

The EO also directs the Treasury Secretary to take ""prompt action"" to implement the enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions in the Act within 45 days following enactment. The complex FEOC provisions included in the Act limit the ability of ""prohibited foreign entities,"" as defined in the Act, to claim tax credits for qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology that begin construction after December 31, 2025. Taxpayers cannot claim these credits if they engage in sourcing (including, ""material assistance""), licensing, or payments to a prohibited foreign entity. The material assistance restriction renders a taxpayer ineligible for the credit if a certain percentage of the value of a project is sourced from one or more prohibited foreign entities. A taxpayer needs to have a ratio higher than the thresholds set forth in the Act to qualify for the credit.

There are some exceptions, including for certain foreign-controlled publicly traded companies. There are also exceptions for certain manufactured products and eligible components acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and that are placed into service before January 1, 2030 (or for wind and solar facilities before January 1, 2028) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Key Takeaways

Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance. Ensuring that substantiation and documentation requirements are met at the outset will allow for better results during an IRS examination. Tax credit buyers and investors should continue to carefully diligence projects to ensure that energy tax credit requirements are met.

While the focus of the July 7thEO and promises made in connection with the passages of the Act appear to focus on the new requirements set forth in the Act, the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit tax years dating back to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 remains open, so taxpayers should ensure that they have audit files at the ready to prepare for possible IRS enforcement activity.

are expected to increase energy demands and as renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, have become cheaper than fossil fuels.","ASHEVILLE - Though only a few employees milled about the West Asheville-based renewable energy provider on July 10, Sugar Hollow Solar is busy these days. All of the company's vans were out on job sites, making solar panel installations on hot rooftops or maintaining systems.

Despite steady business, shifting federal policies have the company of around 65 people bracing for impact. Federal support for residential solar panel installations will wind down later this year.

""It's going to be bad for our economy and just overall in our industry,"" Sugar Hollow Solar's co-founder and CEO Doug Ager said. ""There are going to be some job losses.""

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed into office by President Donald Trump on July 4, will wind down many renewable energy tax credits that incentivized investment into residential renewable energy technologies. Tax credits for residential solar, wind and geothermal installations will end later this year and installations for commercial renewable energy and sustainable homebuilding are set to wind down in 2026 and 2027. The changes give companies like Sugar Hollow Solar mere months to adjust.

For years, Sugar Hollow's residential customers could expect to receive tax credits for installing solar panels. The Residential Clean Energy Credit covers 30% the cost of new residential renewable installations and saved consumers roughly $8,000 to $12,000 per installation, the company's COO Clary Franko said in an interview.

After the bill's passage, the credit, which traces its roots back to the Energy Policy Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2006, will end Dec. 31, giving customers a strict deadline to qualify for lower-cost installations.

""Like everyone in the industry, it's not like we're scheduling for tomorrow,"" Franko said of solar panel installations. ""We're already scheduling a couple few months out. It just doesn't give people a lot of time.""

Investments in innovation, halted

The credits have widely been seen as short-to-mid term investments into the renewable energy sector, which has seen a period of intense growth and innovation in recent years.

From 2012 to 2024, renewable energy production has doubled its share of the country's energy generation growing from 12% to 24%, according to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. The credits also came as increased demand for data centers and A.I. are expected to increase energy demands and as renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, have become cheaper than fossil fuels. But now some are wondering whether that innovation will slow down.

""They were funding innovation and now they are not. I think that's a mistake,"" said Donald Nicholson, who co-owns the family business Nicholson and Sun, which builds net-zero homes across Asheville.

Nicholson's company utilizes the New Energy Efficient Home Credit, which provided $5,000 in credits to contractors that construct and sell homes that are so ""energy efficient that a renewable energy system could offset most or all the home's annual energy use,"" according to the official Zero Energy Ready Home webpage. It was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and set to phase out in 2032, the Big Beautiful Bill will end the program on June 30, 2026.

For more attainable sustainable homebuyers, the ""party's over,"" Nicholson said, as the credit repeal will likely impact pricing. At his company's net-zero community in West Asheville, most available homes fall below the city's current median cost of $507,000. The money makes a difference for homeowners on a tighter budget.

""We try to build entry-level, attainable homes where $5,000 is actually a significant profit,"" Nicholson said. Similarly, Ager expects the residential credit changes to make it harder for lower income residents to invest in renewable technology like solar panel installations.

""Especially in middle income families. It'll make it harder for them to invest in this long-term,"" Ager said

Shifting business, surviving Helene

While utility-level renewable residential credits exist in North Carolina, Sugar Hollow Solar expects to shift it's business from mostly residential installations to a ""50-50"" split with commercial projects, Ager said. Tax credits for commercial projects will expire in 2027, with some credits for battery installations lasting longer.

But, still, at the beginning of 2026, they expect a lull or even contractions in the industry, Ager told the Citizen Times. The business is still optimistic, however. Sugar Hollow Solar's offices had been located along Thompson Street when Tropical Storm Helene hit. The Swannanoa River swamped their offices and led to a roughly $1.4 million loss. A swath of flooded solar panels sit outside their offices, and though they were muddied in the storm, they still work. Ager is considering donating them to a partner in Ukraine.

Two weeks after the storm, the company began making installations again. The company plans to continue through the Big Beautiful Bill's changes.

""We'll be here. We're not going anywhere,"" Ager said.

Two recent examples in Indiana and Virginia demonstrate how some utilities are adapting their rate structures to serve large load customers.
[3] The proposal would require new large load customers to sign a fixed 14-year contract term with the ability to ramp load during the first 4 years.
According to Dominion’s filing this rate would apply to 139 customer accounts including 131 data centers, approximately 30% of data center customer accounts in Dominion’s Virginia service area.
[4] Dominion has also committed to proposing an experimental “High Load Interruptible Load Tariff” in a future proceeding.","The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, hyperscale cloud platforms, and real-time data analytics is fueling a surge in data center development that is driving electricity demand growth not seen in decades, if ever. For electric utilities, this presents an unprecedented opportunity to deploy capital into the infrastructure needed to meet the unique energy demands of data center customers. However, the pace, scale, and uncertainty of demand growth also creates new operational, financial, and regulatory challenges for utilities.

Data center customers have unique service requirements (e.g., large loads, high load factors, preference for low-carbon solutions), a desire to interconnect quickly (relative to traditional commercial and industrial customers), and they tend to be highly sophisticated (i.e., experienced energy/PPA buyers). Meanwhile, utilities have not experienced this level of load growth in decades and accurately forecasting demand has proven difficult in part due to speculative data center proposals and uncertainty around technology enhancements that may reduce the energy needed to power AI and other computing functions. Further, most utilities face resource constraints, be that financial, human, or access to materials. Resources needed to support data center growth may be limited due to other on-going efforts to modernize the grid, improve system reliability and resiliency, and enable the adoption of distributed energy resources and electrification.

Both utilities and regulators are examining the potential operational impacts of data centers, and increasingly, the potential financial implications to other electricity customers. Across the country, utilities are adapting existing tariffs, creating new rate classes, and/or changing energy services agreements to provide clear rules for large load customers while protecting other customers from unfairly bearing the costs of new infrastructure investments that are built primarily to serve these new large load customers.

Traditional ratemaking principles require that utility rates be “just and reasonable,” with costs allocated based on the principle of cost causation (i.e., customers should pay for the costs they impose on the system). To achieve these principles, utilities are considering a variety of tariff or contract provisions for new large load customers including:

Minimum Demand Charges: Requiring customers to pay for a percentage of their contracted capacity, even if actual usage is lower

Minimum Contract Duration: Locking in long-term agreements, which may include ramp-up periods as data centers come online

Exit Fees: Requiring companies to pay hefty fees if they decide to break their contract

Collateral and Credit Requirements: Mitigating financial risks if data center businesses fail

The rate structures and tariff provisions relevant to a given utility will depend on a variety of factors including the market environment and regulatory jurisdiction (i.e., is it a T&D only utility or fully integrated), current system capacity, and the scale of data center demand, among others. Two recent examples in Indiana and Virginia demonstrate how some utilities are adapting their rate structures to serve large load customers.

Indiana Michigan Power a subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP)

In February 2025, Indiana Michigan Power received commission approval to modify its existing industrial tariff to accommodate large loads.[1] The modified tariff applies to customers with new or expanding load with contract capacity greater than (or expected to be greater than) 70 MW at one location or 150 MW in aggregate across multiple locations (each location must exceed 1 MW). The modified tariff also includes provisions which require large load customers to sign an initial contract term of at least 12 years, with an allowable load ramp period of up to 5 years, pay an exit fee if they reduce their contact capacity by more than 20 percent, pay a minimum monthly demand charge of at least 80 percent of their contract capacity, and provide sufficient collateral if they do not meet certain credit rating and liquidity requirements.[2]

Virginia Electric and Power Company a subsidiary Dominion Energy

In March 2025, Virginia Electric and Power Company submitted a request to create a new customer class (GS-5) for existing and new customers with measured or contract demand at one site of 25 MW or greater and a load factor of at least 75 percent.[3] The proposal would require new large load customers to sign a fixed 14-year contract term with the ability to ramp load during the first 4 years. The proposal would also allow customers to reduce their contracted capacity by 20 percent, further reduction in capacity or termination would trigger an exit fee. GS-5 customers also would need to pay a minimum monthly demand charge covering 85 percent of contracted capacity for transmission and distribution, as well as 60 percent of generation. Lastly, large load customers would be required to post a collateral of $1.5M per MW of their contracted capacity if they are unable to meet credit and liquidity requirements. According to Dominion’s filing this rate would apply to 139 customer accounts including 131 data centers, approximately 30% of data center customer accounts in Dominion’s Virginia service area.[4] Dominion has also committed to proposing an experimental “High Load Interruptible Load Tariff” in a future proceeding.

Put in other terms, the richest 1% of Americans would get about 22% of the bill’s tax benefits in 2026.
Much of the bill’s tax policy is an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The New Hampshire state budget signed into law in June increases prescription co-pays and charges some enrollees premiums.
The budget, which was passed before the federal bill, also enacts work requirements.","When Michelle Lawrence heard about the Medicaid cuts included in the Republican tax and spending bill signed into law on July 4, it felt like “a punch to the gut.”

“I laugh, because if I don’t laugh, I cry,” she said.

Lawrence, who lives in Henniker, was diagnosed with a chronic form of cancer called T-cell lymphocytic leukemia 16 years ago. She said she lost her job about five years ago because the cancer was making it too difficult for her to work. And in losing her job, she lost her health insurance because she couldn’t afford COBRA coverage or anything on the marketplace.

“So I applied for Medicaid, which has been a major lifeline for me,” she continued. “That has enabled me and a lot of other cancer patients like me to be able to access the treatment needed in the past few years. I’m here. I’m alive and a contributing member of society. … Without Medicaid, I wouldn’t be able to afford my treatments or go to the doctor.”

Lawrence works 40 hours a month at a nonprofit assisting people with disabilities. Between the symptoms of her cancer and the side effects of her treatment, she can’t work any more than that, she said. But the “big beautiful bill” adds a work requirement to Medicaid that requires people to work 80 hours per month to receive coverage.

“Those 40 hours a month are hard for me to do. I have had cancer for 16 years,” she said. “I can’t create a healthier Michelle that’s going to be able to work 80 hours. If I could, I would have by now, because I’d rather be working. No one wants to be sick and no one wants to be unable to work.”

The bill includes exceptions to the work requirements for “serious and complex medical conditions,” but it’s still unclear if that exemption will apply to all cancer patients, just some cancer patients, or no cancer patients at all. Lawrence said she asked the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, the agency responsible for administering Medicaid in the state, but officials there didn’t have an answer for her.

“And that’s the scary part,” Lawrence said. “It feels like the Wild, Wild West. So we passed this bill, and now it’s left up to interpretation, and I don’t think that’s reasonable, because what am I supposed to do? Like, just carry on and wait to find out if or if not I get kicked off? Should I be planning a funeral instead of my next doctor’s appointment?”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, affects huge swaths of the federal government’s services, budget, and tax code. The bill extends a set of tax cuts enacted in a signature piece of legislation from the first Trump administration, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And it makes deep cuts to social services in order to partially pay for the tax breaks, though independent bipartisan analysis from the Congressional Budget Office still projects the bill will increase the federal deficit. The bill also includes a number of other tax and unrelated provisions. The effective date of those provisions varies, with some changes — such as some of the Medicaid cuts — set to take effect after the 2026 midterm elections.

The cuts will leave states with tough decisions about whether to cover the new funding holes with state money — a big challenge for states like New Hampshire that are in tight budget cycles of their own — or cut the programs.

Asked about her thoughts on the bill and whether the state should pay to fill those gaps, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte provided a statement to the Bulletin: “We are evaluating the impact of the recently passed federal legislation on New Hampshire. I disagree with federal reductions to SNAP and Medicaid benefits and will work closely with DHHS to protect our most vulnerable citizens.”

New Hampshire’s delegation dissents

The bill has been lambasted by Democrats, including the four members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, all Democrats who voted against the bill.

“What this president calls the big beautiful bill, I call the big beautiful betrayal of the American people,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said during a press conference Tuesday. “This bill takes food and health care away from seniors and families to give trillions of dollars more to corporations and to the wealthiest.”

First District Rep. Chris Pappas, who represents the eastern half of the state, called the bill “a disaster for the American people.”

“It’s a cruel bill that contains deep cuts that are going to impact our families, our neighbors, all across the state of New Hampshire,” he said. “This is decidedly unpopular here in New Hampshire … But the fact is, our colleagues across the aisle, it’s not that they didn’t hear it, it’s that they didn’t listen to what people were actually saying.”

Pappas is vacating his seat in the House of Representatives at the end of this term in order to run for Senate in 2026. Scott Brown, one of his Republican opponents in that election, did not respond to the Bulletin’s request for an interview, but he has publicly targeted Pappas for his vote against the bill, writing on social media, “Pappas will side with left-wing partisans in Congress over the people of New Hampshire and the tax certainty in the budget reconciliation package.”

“I proudly support President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill because working families deserve a break,” Brown wrote in a separate post, pointing specifically to provisions that eliminate taxes on tips and overtime.

Tax cuts felt by the rich and the deficit

An analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based fiscal think tank, shows the bill’s tax benefits are heavily skewed to America’s wealthiest. The richest fifth of Americans are set to receive roughly 72% of the net tax benefits in the bill in 2026, while the middle fifth would receive roughly 10%. The poorest fifth would receive less than 1% of the benefits, according to the analysis. Put in other terms, the richest 1% of Americans would get about 22% of the bill’s tax benefits in 2026.

In New Hampshire, the top 1% of households are expected to receive 16% of the bill’s tax benefits, according to the same think tank’s analysis. Those households, which earn more than $894,699 annually, are expected to pay $59,170 less in taxes over the course of 2026, on average. The poorest 20% of New Hampshire households, on the other hand, will receive 1% of the bill’s tax benefits. Those households, which earn less than $37,000, are expected to get $200 in annual savings across 2026.

Many fiscal conservatives embraced the tax cut portion of the bill. Much of the bill’s tax policy is an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a New Hampshire-based conservative think tank, championed those changes and was happy to see them extended.

“To the extent that One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes permanent the 2017 tax rates and does some expansion in terms of business tax deductions … that’s good,” Drew Cline, the organization’s executive director, said. “Those 2017 changes were designed to achieve two main goals: One was to simplify the code, and the other was to stimulate growth. So to the extent that the new bill furthers those goals, those are positive.”

Cline acknowledged that the bill’s tax benefits primarily go to the wealthiest Americans, but he dismissed that as a concern “because the rich are the ones who pay the vast majority of income taxes” already. He argued that the U.S. tax code is currently very progressive, so any tax benefits would be felt by those paying the most taxes already. (Other think tanks disagree on the U.S. tax code’s progressivity; the Brookings Institution, for example, argues the tax code is less progressive relative to peer countries including the U.K., Canada, Spain, Greece, Japan, Germany, and Australia, among others, and is becoming less progressive over time.)

Still, Cline isn’t entirely on board with the bill. He’s not a fan of how tax exemptions for tips and overtime included in the bill will complicate the tax code, which he believes should be simplified. More importantly, Cline is worried about the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit across the coming decade.

“The bigger story here is that we are spending and we are borrowing at crisis levels when we don’t have a crisis,” he said. “And that is not sustainable.”

The biggest cut to Medicaid in U.S. history

The bill cuts Medicaid nearly $1 trillion over the next decade through a number of different provisions. In New Hampshire specifically, the bill is expected to revoke 18% of New Hampshire’s federal baseline spending for Medicaid, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s $3 billion over 10 years. Medicaid, which is funded and operated jointly by state and federal governments, covers roughly 186,000 people in New Hampshire, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

One of the biggest changes to Medicaid is the new work requirements. Opponents of work requirements argue that a vast majority of Medicaid enrollees are already working, that the paperwork and bureaucracy required to prove eligibility is too burdensome for states to do effectively, and that many people — like Lawrence, the cancer patient — are not only too sick to meet the requirement but often not well enough to complete the bureaucratic process of proving they can’t work.

Work requirements have been unsuccessfully attempted at the state level a few times, including in New Hampshire. In 2018, the state enacted a law mandating Medicaid enrollees work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. However, about one month after the rule went into effect in 2019, only about 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement complied and documented their hours. At that point, then-Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, intervened and paused the new system before the remaining roughly 17,000 people lost coverage. The state had spent more than $130,000 in outreach efforts to inform recipients of the requirements and to teach them how to complete the eligibility paperwork. Arkansas and Georgia have also tried to implement work requirements. Arkansas had similar issues until a federal judge intervened and blocked the law.

The cuts also come at the same time as a number of changes to Medicaid at the state level. The New Hampshire state budget signed into law in June increases prescription co-pays and charges some enrollees premiums. The budget, which was passed before the federal bill, also enacts work requirements. However, details on the state work requirements have yet to be ironed out and need to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s also unclear how the state rule would work in relation to the new federal requirements.

U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a former governor who oversaw New Hampshire’s expansion of Medicaid in 2014 before being elected to the Senate, called the bill “the largest cut to Medicaid we have seen in our nation’s history.”

Shaheen, her colleague in the Senate, compared the cuts to Republicans’ failed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.

“We celebrated (in 2017) because we knew that millions of Americans were going to continue to have access to health care,” she said. “Our colleagues in the Senate and the administration are celebrating (now) because millions of Americans are going to lose their access to health care.”

Cuts to SNAP

Laura Milliken, executive director of NH Hunger Solutions, a statewide advocacy group working to address hunger in New Hampshire, said the bill “is just a world of bad.”

The bill includes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps low-income families pay for food. Those cuts are expected to cause 22.3 million families in the U.S. to lose some or all of their SNAP benefits.

“It just is so, so unnecessary and cruel at a time that we’re all feeling like everything’s expensive,” Milliken said. “People are having difficulty affording their housing, their child care, their medication. It seems like the moment to strengthen our programs that protect low-income folks and not to cut them, and this is such a drastic change in the program.”

The bill passes off much of the administrative cost of SNAP to states, which may or may not be willing or able to take on those costs. The bill also reduces benefits for some recipients by restricting what factors can be taken into account when deciding how much a family receives. The bill also caps future increases to SNAP at the rate of inflation. It bans many migrants (specifically refugees and asylees) from participating in the program (people in the country without legal status were already ineligible). And work requirements will become stricter.

“People are scared,” Milliken said. “People are thinking, ‘Boy, I’m barely making ends meet right now, what am I going to do if my SNAP benefits are cut?’”

Milliken said many of the food pantries in New Hampshire are afraid they won’t be able to keep up with the increased demand they expect to see as the provisions of the bill go into effect. She also noted that because SNAP automatically qualifies kids for free and reduced-price school meals, which in turn qualify schools for federal aid, the changes will likely impact other programs as well.

Milliken said NH Hunger Solutions hopes to work with state officials to try to mitigate the effects the bill will have on food insecurity in New Hampshire.

Other provisions

The omnibus bill also has a myriad of unrelated provisions that touch nearly every segment of the federal government.

For example, the bill eliminates the IRS direct file program, which sought to help Americans file their taxes for free. The bill also limits the dollar amount of student loans graduate and professional students can take out. It also eliminates regulations for nursing home staffing requirements, revokes Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, and eliminates several tax credits meant to encourage environmentally friendly practices.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/johnsonbbb-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:39.952587

""Our partnership with Eaton will deliver innovation that addresses the biggest barriers to electrified transportation,"" ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said.

This development is expected to roll out across the United States, Canada, and Europe. It will make EV charging more reliable and maximize the potential and power of EVs.

Using EVs reduces air pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency notes that creating electricity for charging EVs can be done with dirty energy. But EVs themselves don't have tailpipe emissions.

If solar or wind is used to generate electricity, that prevents even more pollution from entering the air.

Charging stations are also becoming more widespread, and batteries are becoming more efficient. A Recurrent study suggests that older models' battery life patterns demonstrate that newer models' batteries will last even longer.

While many people are debunking EV myths, it's important to note that the current EV manufacturing process is still flawed.

The production of EV batteries involves the use of cobalt. EV Magazine has reported on the human rights issues in the cobalt industry in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. EVs are a step toward a greener future, but no one should have to suffer for a cleaner climate.

Companies are working on solutions to create cobalt-free batteries. EV Magazine references Aliant Battery, a company that has been making rechargeable, cobalt-free, lithium batteries since 2022.

You can minimize the resources needed to make this transition happen by buying a used EV. While all models are becoming more affordable over time, buying used can help you save money and minimize waste.

The EPA’s climate change website, for instance, is still up and running, even though all references to the phenomenon were erased on the agency’s home page.
Up until the National Climate Assessments disappeared, she would have said that “climate erasure” was an inappropriate characterization of what’s happening.","For 25 years, a group of the country’s top experts has been fastidiously tracking the ways that climate change threatens every part of the United States. Their findings informed the National Climate Assessments, a series of congressionally mandated reports released every four years that translated the science into accessible warnings for policymakers and the public. But that work came to a halt this spring when the Trump administration abruptly dismissed all 400 experts working on the next edition. Then, on June 30, all of the past reports vanished too, along with the federal website they lived on.

A lot of information about the changing climate has disappeared under President Donald Trump’s second term, but the erasure of the National Climate Assessments is “by far the biggest loss we’ve seen,” said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The National Climate Assessments were one of the most approachable resources that broke down how climate change will affect the places people care about, she said. The reports were also used by a wide swath of stakeholders — policymakers, farmers, businesses — to guide their decisions about the future. While the reports have been archived elsewhere, they’re no longer as easy to access. And it’s unclear what, if anything, will happen to the report that was planned for 2027 or 2028, which already existed in draft form.

So why did the reports survive Trump’s first term, but not his second? You could view their disappearance in a few different ways, experts said — as a flex of executive power, an escalation in the culture war over climate change, or a strategic attempt to erase the scientific foundation for climate policy. “If you suppress information and data, then you don’t have the evidence you need to be able to create regulations, strengthen regulations, and even to combat the repeal of regulations,” Gehrke said.

This isn’t climate denial in the traditional sense. The days of loudly debating the science have mostly given way to something quieter and more insidious: a campaign to withhold the raw information itself. “I don’t know if we’re living in climate denial anymore,” said Leah Aronowsky, a science historian at Columbia Climate School. “We have this new front of denial by erasure.”

By cutting funding for research and withholding crucial data, the Trump administration is making it harder to know exactly how the planet is changing. In April, the administration pulled nearly $4 million in funding from a Princeton program to improve computer models predicting changes in the oceans and atmosphere, claiming the work created “climate anxiety” among young people. That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency failed to submit its annual report to the United Nations detailing the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ended its 45-year tradition of tracking billion-dollar weather disasters. Trump also hopes to shut down the Mauna Loa laboratory in Hawaiʻi, which has measured the steady rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide since the 1950s — the first data to definitively show humans were changing the climate.

“This kind of wholesale suppression of an entire field of federally sponsored research, to my knowledge, is historically unprecedented,” Aronowsky said.

In a response to a request for comment, the EPA directed Grist to a webpage containing past greenhouse gas emissions reports, as well as a version of what was supposed to be this year’s report obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund. However, the agency confirmed that the latest data has not been officially released. The White House declined to comment, and neither NASA nor NOAA responded in time for publication.

Last year, a leaked training video from Project 2025 — the policy roadmap organized by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank — showed a former Trump official declaring that political appointees would have to “eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere.” The strategy appears to be designed to boost the fossil fuel industry at a time when clean energy has become competitive and the reality of climate change harder to dismiss, as floods, fires, and heat waves have become perceptibly worse. “We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said in his inauguration speech in January.

The administration hasn’t exactly been subtle about its endgame. Lee Zeldin, the head of the EPA, doesn’t deny the reality of climate change (he calls himself a “climate realist”), but he’s zealously dismantled environmental programs and has recommended that the White House strike down the “endangerment finding,” the bedrock of U.S. climate policy. It comes from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Air Act that required the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants since they endanger public health. If the administration can convince the courts that climate change isn’t a health consideration, it could end that regulatory obligation.

“If you’re removing information about climate change, its reality, and its impact on people, then I think it’s a lot easier to make the case that it’s not an environmental health issue,” Gehrke said.

There’s a word for the idea that ignorance can serve political ends: agnotology (from the Greek “agnosis,” or “not knowing”), the study of how knowledge is deliberately obscured. What Trump is doing to information about climate change fits squarely in that tradition, according to Aronowsky: “If you remove it, then in a certain sense, it no longer exists, and therefore, there’s nothing to even debate, right?”

Climate denial first took off in the 1990s, when the oil and gas companies and industry-friendly think tanks started sowing doubt about climate science. Over the decades, as the evidence became rock-solid, those who opposed reducing the use of fossil fuels gradually shifted from outright denying the facts to attacking solutions like wind and solar power. What the Trump administration is doing now marks a radical break from this long-term trend, said John Cook, a climate misinformation researcher at The University of Melbourne in Australia. “This is a 180, not just a turn, but diving into something we’ve never even seen before,” he said. On the other hand, Cook said, the administration is taking a classic climate denial tactic — painting scientists as “alarmists” or conspirators who can’t be trusted — and turning it into government policy.

Half a year in, the second Trump administration’s treatment of climate information hasn’t yet reached the “eradication” levels that Project 2025 aspired to, at least on government websites. The EPA’s climate change website, for instance, is still up and running, even though all references to the phenomenon were erased on the agency’s home page. Most of the website deletions so far have served to isolate climate change as an issue, erasing its relationship to topics such as health and infrastructure, Gehrke said. Up until the National Climate Assessments disappeared, she would have said that “climate erasure” was an inappropriate characterization of what’s happening. “But now, I’m really not so sure,” she said.

Rachel Cleetus, the senior policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, thinks that the administration’s actions actually go beyond erasure. “They’re literally trying to change the basis on which a lot of policymaking is advanced — the science basis, the legal basis, and the economic basis,” she said. Her biggest concern isn’t just what facts have been removed, but what political propaganda might replace them. “That’s more dangerous, because it really leaves people in this twilight zone, where what’s real, and what’s important, and what is going to affect their daily lives is just being obfuscated.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/natl-climate-assessment-social.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-07-14 07:19:48.926260

As part of the initiative, used batteries from Zenith’s fleet will be managed through Recell.Store’s digital platform, enabling second-life applications where suitable. Batteries that can no longer be repurposed will be responsibly recycled at parent company Altilium’s state-of-the-art battery recycling facilities in Devon, helping to recover critical materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel for reuse in the EV battery supply chain.

“Together, we’re making it easier and safer for fleet owners to handle EV battery disposal responsibly and meet their ESG requirements, while unlocking second-life value and reducing environmental impact” said Rod Savage, Head of Operations at recell.store.

As sales of EVs continues to grow, so too will the need for responsible management of end-of-life batteries. According to McKinsey, over 100 million batteries are expected to be retired in the next decade.

“Finding a safe and ethical way to dispose of batteries addresses a current and growing issue in our sector” added Alan Bastey, Decarbonisation and Sustainability Consultant at Zenith. “This partnership ensures we have the foundations in place to enable us to manage the asset responsibly on behalf of our customer, while setting standards within the industry.”

Recell.Store will partner with OEMs, salvage yards and fleet owners to ensure efficient and safe reuse, repurposing and recycling of batteries. By recovering the critical materials such as lithium and nickel from battery waste, Altilium is creating a sustainable domestic supply chain for the battery metals essential for the UK’s transition to a clean transport future.

Altilium’s proprietary EcoCathode recycling process can recover over 95 percent of the cathode metals from EV battery waste, in a format that can be directly reused in battery manufacturing, with up to 74 percent lower GHG emissions compared to mined materials and 20 percent lower costs.

SNAP cuts will also hit the state, said Ife Finch Floyd, the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute's director of economic justice.
The federal cuts extend that to age 64 and will require parents of kids ages 14-17 to hold a job.
Nearly $4.5 trillion in tax cuts nationwide are projected to add a net $3.24 trillion to the red ink.
Without the bill, those 2017 tax cuts would have expired, leading to a major tax increase, Wingfield said.","The new federal budget bill passed by Congress includes significant cuts to healthcare, food assistance, and clean energy programs, while also extending tax cuts.

Critics argue the cuts will disproportionately harm low- and middle-income Georgians, particularly in rural areas, and increase the state's financial burden.

Supporters contend the tax cuts benefit all income levels and that work requirements for Medicaid recipients could incentivize employment.

The bill's impact on Georgia includes potential hospital closures, increased health insurance premiums, reduced food assistance, and setbacks for the renewable energy sector.

ATLANTA - When Congress passed President Donald Trump's controversial budget bill July 3, Republicans and Democrats went to their corners to portray it either as the largest tax cut in U.S. history or a devastating gutting of the nation's safety net.

But beyond the politics, Georgia health-care and clean-energy advocates warned that cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and food stamps, as well as the phasing out of clean-energy tax credits will hurt low- and middle-income Georgians in exchange for easing the tax burden on the wealthy who don't need such government largesse.

""It's the largest cut ever, and it moves us in the wrong direction,"" said Monte Veazey, president and CEO of the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals. ""It's a moral failure that hurts everyone who depends on our health-care system.""

The bill's cuts to health care will kick about 93,000 Georgians off of Medicaid and raise health-insurance premiums for more than 1.2 million Georgians, according to numbers released by U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. More than 120,000 Georgia children will lose some or all food assistance, according to Warnock.

Veazey said rural Georgia will be hit particularly hard, with 16 cash-strapped rural hospitals facing potential closure and others being forced to reduce services they offer that lose money.

""For every Medicaid patient we serve, we lose about 17 cents on the dollar,"" he said. ""This is going to grow that number. It's going to be difficult for people to access the health-care system.""

Advocates for low-income Georgians and children said the federal cuts will shift the cost of paying for health insurance and food to states.

Georgia will have a couple of choices, they said: dig into its own treasury to fill the void or cut services.

State cutbacks to the ACA, Medicaid and SNAP (the food stamps program) could be achieved by introducing more administrative requirements, they said, something the federal government is already imposing.

Identity ""proofing"" challenges with ACA ""mean that many folks just won't enroll because of administrative burdens,"" said Whitney Griggs, director of health policy for Georgians for a Healthy Future.

Work requirements and direct cuts will cost Georgia $10 billion in Medicaid funding over the next decade, said Leah Chan, director of health justice for the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute.

SNAP cuts will also hit the state, said Ife Finch Floyd, the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute's director of economic justice.

The federal government historically has covered the full cost of SNAP, but the new budget bill changed that by requiring states to pay a percentage of their cost if they have an unacceptable payment ""error rate,"" meaning inaccurate eligibility roles, Chan said.

""This is unprecedented, and this is a fundamental change in the structure of the SNAP program,"" she said.

In a few years, states with an error rate of 6% or more will have to pay 5% to 15% of their program benefit costs, Chan said, noting that in Georgia, 5% is equal to $162 million.

It also will become harder for Georgians to qualify for SNAP with the new federal work requirements. Currently, people ages 18-54 without children or a qualifying disability must prove they are working 80 hours a month to receive benefits. The federal cuts extend that to age 64 and will require parents of kids ages 14-17 to hold a job.

The phasing out of clean-energy tax credits will do tremendous damage to fast-growing renewable energy and electric vehicle operations across Georgia, said Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga. The massive EV plant Hyundai opened in March west of Savannah in Bryan County is the largest economic development project in the state's history.

""The renewable sector, solar manufacturing, battery production, electric vehicle manufacturing will all be hurt,"" Ossoff said. ""This bill is a direct attack on the industry that is driving Georgia's economic development, job creation, and wealth creation.""

The same goes for the state's solar energy industry, added Hannah Shultz, program director at the nonprofit Georgia Interfaith Power and Light.

""Solar tax incentives have allowed over a dozen faith communities in the last several years to build resilience, reduce their electric costs, and reinvest savings into vital mission and ministry initiatives in service to their communities,"" she said. ""It is incredibly disheartening to see partisan politics take precedence over real impacts to people and our planet.""

While most of the reaction to the budget bill has come from critics decrying the various spending cuts, one group that stands to benefit from the legislation is farmers.

Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tyler Harper said prices of farm inputs have increased by 30% in the last half dozen years. Nationally, the bill invests an additional $60 billion in farm programs.

""It helps agriculture across the board,"" Harper said. ""Investment in farm programs ... is a success for all farms regardless of size.""

Even taxpayer advocates are criticizing the bill because of its impact on the nation's growing debt. Nearly $4.5 trillion in tax cuts nationwide are projected to add a net $3.24 trillion to the red ink.

""Congress has officially lost its mind when it comes to fiscal responsibility,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a really ugly, scary, ticking debt bomb.""

But Kyle Wingfield, president and CEO of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, said the bill's tax cuts simply make permanent the lower tax rates Congress enacted early in Trump's first term in the White House. Without the bill, those 2017 tax cuts would have expired, leading to a major tax increase, Wingfield said.

Wingfield disputed claims by opponents that the measure only benefits the wealthy.

""It's all the brackets all the way up and down,"" he said. ""The bulk of the tax money that gets cut goes to the middle class because there are so many middle-class taxpayers.""

The work requirement in the bill for Medicaid recipients has been widely criticized since many face significant barriers to employment including health problems and child-care duties.

But Wingfield said the legislation could give able-bodied recipients the incentive they need to find a job.

""Far from being a punitive or harmful policy, this could end up helping people be in a better position,"" he said.","https://www.augustachronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/10/PTAL/84541276007-trump-and-bill-signing.jpg?crop=1878,1056,x0,y0&width=1878&height=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-14 05:08:32.110518

BID Energy’s 4,000MWh BESS in New South Wales

BID Energy, an independent advisory and development firm specialising in renewable energy projects, is leading the largest of the two initiatives.

The company is also pursuing another BESS project in Australia: the 400MW/800MWh Derringullen Energy Storage System near Yass, New South Wales.

The new utility-scale 4,000MWh Kiar BESS will be located in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, just under 100km north of Sydney. The project will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via a 330kV transmission line running through the site, owned by network operator Transgrid.

By leveraging this existing infrastructure, BID Energy aims to minimise the costs of connecting the project to the NEM.

The Kiar BESS will include rows of enclosed battery modules connected to power conversion systems (PCS) and underground 33kV high-voltage ring main reticulation equipment and switchgear.

The layout and quantity of battery modules, PCS, and ring main units will be finalised during the detailed design and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process.

The project will cover approximately 110 hectares and will be decommissioned at the end of its proposed 25-year operational life. Construction is expected to take 18 to 24 months, with commissioning anticipated for late 2027 or early 2028.

BID Energy has committed to working with the Central Coast Council, local residents, Indigenous groups, businesses, and other stakeholders to ensure the project benefits the community through benefit-sharing arrangements.

X-Elio’s 1,200MWh BESS in the Southern Tablelands

Spanish sustainable energy developer X-Elio, owned by Canadian asset manager Brookfield, is proposing the 300MW/1,200MWh Canyonleigh BESS in the Southern Tablelands region of New South Wales.

The project is located near Brayton, around 200km southwest of Sydney and 120km northeast of Canberra.

The Canyonleigh BESS will be situated to the east of X-Elio’s proposed Willavale Park Renewable Energy project, which features 300MW/600MWh of BESS co-located with a 72MWp solar PV power plant. Like BID Energy’s Kiar BESS, the Canyonleigh system will connect to the NEM.

The project will cover approximately 48 hectares, with the BESS itself requiring around 13 hectares.

According to the EPBC Act application, the Canyonleigh BESS will consist of lithium-ion battery units housed in shipping container-style enclosures, along with inverters, transformers, and other related electrical infrastructure.

Construction, including grid connection and commissioning, is expected to take 12 to 18 months. The BESS will have an operational lifespan of between 20 and 30 years.

X-Elio’s expanding BESS Portfolio in Australia

X-Elio is actively developing energy storage projects across Australia, many of which integrate BESS with renewable energy generation, such as utility-scale solar PV.

Earlier this year, the company submitted plans for a 720MW solar-plus-storage project in Queensland to the EPBC Act. This project features a 4-hour duration 720MW/2,880MWh BESS.

In 2022, X-Elio’s 200MW Blue Grass Solar Farm near Chinchilla, Queensland, began operations. The project is set to add a cumulative 148MW grid-forming BESS in two stages.

Aniruddh Agrawal Founder of Ahaan Solar, tells us more. Excerpts from an interview:

DQ: What inspired you to venture into solar module manufacturing? How does this complement your parent company Airox Nigen's hydrogen expertise?

Aniruddh Agrawal: The inspiration came from a strategic vision to build an integrated clean energy ecosystem. Airox Nigen has been at the forefront of hydrogen generation technology for over three decades. As green hydrogen production relies heavily on clean electricity, solar became a natural extension.

Ahaan Solar was founded to complement Airox’s green hydrogen mission by providing efficient, high-quality solar modules entirely manufactured in India. Together, we are building a vertically integrated renewable value chain that spans from solar power generation to hydrogen production, storage, and application. It’s about bringing synergy between two technologies that are crucial to India’s decarbonization and energy independence goals.

DQ: The Rohnat Renewable Energy Park houses your 2 GW solar module manufacturing project. Can you walk us through the scale, milestones, and impact of this initiative?

Aniruddh Agrawal: Our 17-acre facility in Rohnat, Haryana, is more than a factory, it's a clean energy blueprint. In Phase 1, we’re launching a 600 MW line by mid-2025, with advanced automation and precision engineering capabilities. The full-scale 2 GW capacity will be completed in phases over the next few years.

This project directly aligns with India’s National Solar Mission and the Make in India initiative by reducing reliance on imported solar components. We expect to generate hundreds of jobs, stimulate regional manufacturing, and supply high-efficiency modules for both domestic projects and exports. It's our way of contributing tangibly to India's renewable energy roadmap.

DQ: Ahaan Solar is deploying advanced TOPCon technology in its modules. How do this innovation enhance the efficiency and sustainability of your solar products?

Aniruddh Agrawal: We have chosen TOPCon because they represent the cutting edge of solar efficiency and long-term performance. TOPCon cells offer higher conversion efficiencies and lower degradation, making them ideal for India's high-irradiance conditions. It also combines the best of crystalline and thin-film technologies, ensuring better performance in low-light and high-temperature environments.

Both technologies extend module lifespans and reduce the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) over time. These innovations make our modules more sustainable, not just in terms of energy output, but also in resource use, recyclability, and reliability across varied geographies.

DQ: How does Ahaan Solar integrate cutting-edge technology and sustainable practices throughout your manufacturing process?

Aniruddh Agrawal: Sustainability is embedded in our DNA, because of our history with Airox Nigen. Our facility is designed to optimize water and energy consumption using closed-loop systems and rooftop solar integration. Automation and AI-driven quality control ensure minimal material wastage and consistent output.

We are sourcing raw materials with transparency and focusing on reducing our overall carbon footprint during production. Our R&D team is also working on low-lead soldering and glass recycling initiatives to further green our supply chain. This approach doesn’t just help the planet; it ensures customers receive durable, high-performance modules built with responsibility and care.

DQ: With operations slated to commence by the end of-2025, what are your production targets for both domestic and international markets? How do you plan to scale beyond the initial 600 MW capacity?

Aniruddh Agrawal: Our initial 600 MW line is expected to be operational by the end of 2025, primarily serving domestic demand for utility-scale and rooftop solar projects. Post-commissioning, we aim to ramp up to 1.2 GW within the next 18 months and achieve full 2 GW capacity within the next few years.

Yet, on July 4 President Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law. This legislation fundamentally reorients U.S. energy policy, shifting federal support from renewable energy initiatives toward fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The consequences of this shift carry significant implications for climate finance, emissions trajectories, and global climate action efforts at a critical moment.

Significant investments under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law placed the United States on a path toward reduced carbon emissions through increased reliance on renewable energy, including wind, solar, and electric vehicles. These incentives directly drove investment growth, expanding renewable energy projects nationwide, fostering technological innovation, and significantly boosting green-sector employment.

The Big Beautiful Bill now phases out or dramatically reduces these critical tax incentives and subsidies starting around 2026-2027. Without federal incentives, renewable energy projects previously viable could struggle for financing, and clean energy jobs are likely to be severely impacted. Independent analyses forecast potential job losses in the clean energy sector totaling approximately 830,000 nationwide due to scaled-back investment.

Perhaps the starkest consequence, however, is the anticipated rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Previous climate policy goals sought significant reductions in U.S. emissions aligned with international targets such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement. However, climate researchers estimate that under the Big Beautiful Bill, emissions could rise substantially — by approximately 500 to 730 million metric tons annually by 2035 compared to current projections under existing policies.

Globally, the financial commitment needed to combat climate change has been extensively documented. The 2022 McKinsey report, “The Net-Zero Transition,” estimated that reaching net-zero emissions globally by 2050 requires an annual capital expenditure of approximately $9.2 trillion — $3.5 trillion per year above current investment levels. Similarly, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its 2021 “Net Zero by 2050” report recommended doubling global clean energy investments to around $4 trillion annually by 2030 to meet a 1.5°C warming limit.

Yet global emissions continue to rise. According to the UNEP 2023 Emissions Gap Report, even full implementation of national climate pledges currently leaves the world on track for a dangerous warming scenario between 2.5 and 2.9°C, significantly above the safer 1.5°C threshold. This report underscores that inaction carries severe economic consequences, estimating global losses of $2 trillion to $4 trillion per year by 2100 from unchecked climate disruptions.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (2023) emphasized the urgent need for global emissions to peak by 2025 and halve by 2030 to maintain any realistic hope of staying within the 1.5°C limit. Achieving these goals, according to IPCC analysis, requires global investments in climate mitigation to increase three to six times current spending levels.

With each year that passes without adequate investment, the window to maintain safe levels of warming shrinks dramatically.

The Big Beautiful Bill’s shift away from renewable energy and toward fossil fuels and nuclear power introduces significant economic costs domestically. Experts forecast increased household energy expenses, potentially by $100 to $400 annually per family by 2035, coupled with higher wholesale energy prices. This increase reflects not only a loss of renewable energy cost benefits but also increased reliance on more expensive energy sources over time.

Moreover, the social costs of delayed climate action are not evenly distributed. Marginalized and economically vulnerable communities, already disproportionately impacted by climate-induced disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and heatwaves, face exacerbated financial burdens as energy costs rise and resilience efforts stall. Financial resources to protect and empower these communities through the energy transition are further jeopardized.

Historically, the U.S. has been central to international climate initiatives, financial assistance, and investment mobilization in renewable energy and climate resilience. This new legislative direction reduces America’s leverage in international climate negotiations, potentially weakening the overall global response as other major emitters may reconsider their climate commitments.

As renewable investment momentum shifts toward countries like China and Germany, the U.S. could find itself significantly behind in key economic sectors essential for future global competitiveness, from electric vehicles to battery storage technologies.

The passage of the Big Beautiful Bill highlights the broader challenge facing climate finance globally: political will remains the most critical — and elusive — resource. While technically and economically feasible, meeting global emissions targets requires coordinated, sustained, and significant financial investments. As of 2025, the opportunity to meet the 1.5°C target is widely considered nearly lost. Yet, the slightly higher target of 2°C warming remains achievable, albeit increasingly difficult with every passing year of inaction.

The next several years could decisively shape global climate outcomes for generations. The window for impactful climate action remains narrowly open, but time and financial resources are critically constrained.

The question is no longer about knowing the cost, but whether there remains sufficient political and financial commitment — both within the U.S. and internationally — to make timely, transformative investments. The clock continues to tick.

Investment Takeaway: - Buy: For investors seeking exposure to LNG infrastructure and a company with visible earnings catalysts.","The geopolitical calculus of energy security has never been more intertwined with corporate strategy than it is today for Kinder Morgan (KMI). As the U.S. and European Union (EU) deepen their LNG partnership to counterbalance Russian influence, Kinder Morgan's $8.8 billion project backlog—nearly 65% larger than three years ago—has emerged as a critical lever for sustained earnings growth and a geopolitical bulwark. The company's Southern U.S. infrastructure buildout, anchored by pipelines like the Trident and Gulf Coast Express, is not just a play on rising LNG demand; it's a strategic response to Europe's energy transition, and investors would be wise to take note.

The Backlog Boom and LNG's Role in KMI's Future

Kinder Morgan's project pipeline ($8.8B net as of Q1 2025) is now 91% weighted toward natural gas infrastructure, with LNG exports and Gulf Coast power generation as its twin pillars. Flagship projects like the $1.6B Trident Intrastate Pipeline—set to deliver 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to Texas LNG terminals by early 2027—and the $1.8B South System Expansion 4 (SSE4) highlight the company's focus on linking shale gas abundance to export hubs. These projects are underpinned by long-term contracts, which management claims will generate a first-full-year Project EBITDA multiple of 5.9x upon completion.

The math is compelling: KMI's 2025 budgeted Adjusted EPS of $1.27—a 10% jump from $1.16 in 2024—is directly tied to these capital expenditures. Meanwhile, its recent acquisition of Outrigger Energy II's Bakken infrastructure ($640M) further strengthens its feedgas supply chain, ensuring reliable LNG feedstock for Gulf Coast terminals.

Why the EU Needs Kinder Morgan's Southern U.S. Hub

The EU's energy strategy has shifted decisively toward U.S. LNG. In 2024, the U.S. supplied 46% of EU LNG imports, and post-January 2025—when Russian gas transit through Ukraine ended—European LNG demand surged. By Q1 2025, U.S. LNG's share of EU imports had grown to 53%, displacing Russia's 14% slice. This dynamic is a windfall for Kinder Morgan, as its Gulf Coast infrastructure is the gateway for 70% of U.S. LNG exports.

The EU's REPowerEU plan aims to cut Russian gas dependency further, but renewables alone can't fill the gap. Natural gas remains a bridge fuel, and Kinder's pipelines are the arteries. For instance, the Trident Pipeline will directly connect Katy, Texas shale fields to the Port Arthur LNG terminal, reducing transportation bottlenecks and ensuring European buyers have a reliable, non-Russian supplier.

Risks and Mitigation: Tariffs, Demand, and Geopolitical Volatility

No infrastructure play is without risk. Kinder Morgan faces headwinds like steel tariffs, which could inflate project costs. However, the company has mitigated this by securing domestic steel contracts for two-thirds of its backlog and negotiating cost caps.

On the demand side, the EU's gas consumption has fallen to an 11-year low, but LNG's role is structural. Even with renewables growth, IEEFA forecasts EU LNG demand will remain above 150 billion cubic meters annually through 2030—a level Kinder's backlog is designed to meet.

The Investment Case: EPS Growth and Dividend Discipline

KMI's dividend has grown for 14 consecutive years, and the Q1 2025 hike to $0.2925/share (2% annualized) underscores management's confidence. With a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.1x (projected to drop to 3.8x by year-end), the balance sheet is sturdy enough to support both capital spending and shareholder returns.

Critically, Kinder's backlog is a multi-year earnings catalyst. Each $1B of projects placed into service typically boosts annual EBITDA by ~$170M—meaning the $8.8B backlog could add over $1.5B to EBITDA once fully operational. This trajectory aligns with the company's 2025 guidance: $8.3B in Adjusted EBITDA (+4%) and $2.8B net income (+8%).

Conclusion: A Play on LNG and Geopolitical Certainty

Kinder Morgan's strategic pivot to LNG infrastructure positions it as an indispensable player in the U.S.-EU energy alliance. With its backlog growth and contract-heavy model, KMI is well-placed to convert geopolitical tailwinds into steady EPS growth. For investors seeking a leveraged play on energy security and a dividend stalwart, Kinder Morgan merits a closer look.

Investment Takeaway:

- Buy: For investors seeking exposure to LNG infrastructure and a company with visible earnings catalysts.

- Hold: If you already own KMI, the backlog execution and dividend growth justify patience.

- Avoid: Only if you believe LNG demand will collapse, which seems unlikely given EU's long-term decarbonization plans still rely on natural gas as a transition fuel.

The next few years will be a proving ground for Kinder's strategy, but the stakes—and the LNG exports—are too high for the company to fail.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-14 04:06:25.195617

Supporters are celebrating the win for Frasier Solar but worry about how much the power siting board focused on whether local government opposition was unanimous.
Only within the past few years have state regulators used unanimous local government opposition as a reason to kill proposed solar projects.","A contested solar agrivoltaics project avoided having its permit denied by Ohio regulators, likely thanks to the neutral stances of a county board and one of its townships.

The Ohio Power Siting Board approved construction of the 120-megawatt Frasier Solar project late last month despite local groups’ organizing efforts, which led the other township within the project’s 840-acre footprint and a neighboring township to pass anti-solar resolutions. The power siting board has found that unanimous local government opposition was reason enough to decide other solar projects did not meet a public interest requirement under state law. One of those cases is before the Ohio Supreme Court.

In the Frasier case, however, local governing bodies for Knox County and Clinton Township stayed neutral. Knox County voted unanimously in 2023 to accept a payment arrangement instead of property taxes, which will add more than $40 million for local governments over the project’s 40-year useful life, but it took a neutral position on the project itself.

About six months after an evidentiary hearing — basically an administrative trial — on Frasier Solar, Knox County restricted new solar projects within most of its boundaries. However, legal counsel for the Ohio Ethics Commission found that a conflict of interest prevented Drenda Keesee, a newly elected Knox County commissioner, from taking official action against Frasier Solar because she owned property next to the project site. Another county commissioner served as an ad hoc power siting board member for the Frasier decision, so he could not take a position before hearing the case. He wound up voting with the board’s majority to grant the permit.

Prior to the administrative trial, Clinton Township’s board had clarified that despite an anti-solar position for future projects, it was officially neutral on Frasier Solar.

“We had a very small dog in the fight,” Clinton Township Trustee Jay Maners told Canary Media, noting that most of the project will be in Miller Township. He recalled that there was sparse attendance at early trustee meetings when the project was discussed, with most in favor of it. Then ​“everything exploded” with people suddenly voicing opposition, he said.

“There was a lot of misinformation,” Maners said, such as solar opponents falsely claiming tax dollars would pay for the project, and solar proponents warning about rising energy prices.

The Ohio Power Siting Board’s June 26 ruling discussed Clinton Township’s neutral stance on Frasier Solar, as well as that of Knox County, to stress that local government opposition was not unanimous. The board found that the project was in the public interest and approved the permit.

Supporters are celebrating the win for Frasier Solar but worry about how much the power siting board focused on whether local government opposition was unanimous. That leaves solar energy vulnerable to a standard that depends on potentially arbitrary local government rulings, rather than regulatory experts’ judgment of projects’ merits.

Frasier Solar is exempt from parts of Senate Bill 52, a 2021 law that lets counties block large solar and wind projects before they get to the power siting board. Yet its developer, Open Road Renewables, faced substantial local opposition and misinformation, much of which was stoked by a dark money group with multiple connections to fossil fuel interests and the anti-solar speakers it brought in. Opponents also went to local township meetings to push for anti-solar resolutions.

The staunch local opposition and involvement of fossil fuel interests fit a pattern playing out across the country. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University last month reported a 32% jump in the number of contested projects for 2024 compared with 2023.

Only within the past few years have state regulators used unanimous local government opposition as a reason to kill proposed solar projects. Those projects, like Frasier, were otherwise exempt from parts of the 2021 law. But Ohio regulations don’t contain such a rule. Another part of Ohio law appears to say that local government consent isn’t a condition for siting decisions.

“I’m certainly happy to see this project move forward, and it had every reason to move forward,” said Dan Sawmiller, Ohio energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Yet he questioned what the role of the power siting board is if it lets unanimous local opposition control whether projects go ahead.

“They’ve got the goal post cemented in, and it’s in the wrong location,” Sawmiller said. As he sees it, the board and its staff have a responsibility to use their expertise to make decisions in the public interest for the whole state.

It’s also hard to fact-check local government resolutions, said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a Cleveland State University law professor who testified as an expert witness for the Ohio Environmental Council. Those decisions could be based on misinformation or simply be a response to political pressure, with little focus on the factual basis for objections.

Facts vs. misinformation

Frasier Solar became ​“known nationally as part of a case study on how the fossil fuel industry stokes opposition to renewable energy projects,” said Dave Anderson, policy and communications director for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group on utility and fossil fuel influence.

Testimony at the administrative trial revealed that an anti-solar group called Knox Smart Development had big financial backing by Tom Rastin, who has been a leader of the Empowerment Alliance, an anonymously funded group that promotes the natural gas industry. Rastin is a former vice president of Ariel Corp., which makes equipment for the oil and gas industry.

Anti-solar media flourished throughout the area during the permitting process too. An eight-page Ohio Energy Reporter sent by bulk mail consisted mostly of anti-solar advertorials. Anti-solar stories and ads also ran in outlets such as the Mount Vernon News, which ProPublica described as a conservative ​“pink slime” publication.

Evidence introduced by the developer last summer characterized some of the opposition’s publicity as ​“misinformation campaigns,” which the power siting board noted in its opinion.

Nonetheless, the project had an ​“encouraging level of support, both locally and from across the state,” said Craig Adair, vice president for development at Open Road Renewables. About 40% of those who spoke at local public hearings or filed comments favored the project.

More significantly, the siting board considered the merits of comments, not just the total numbers. In doing so, the board focused on Robertson’s testimony, which found that half of opponents’ unique arguments at local hearings were factually inaccurate or unsupported by evidence. About a third were already addressed by permit conditions, and nearly one-tenth were just subjective opinions, she also found.

“The happy news is that the siting board and the staff weren’t snowed by the number of opposing comments,” Robertson told Canary Media. ​“We really were able to take the wind out of their sails on the vast majority of the negative comments.” A similar analysis may help in future cases, she suggested. ​“We can’t let truth and facts disappear. We have to keep pushing what is real.”

The board’s ruling also noted evidence provided by chapters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about jobs and other positive economic benefits. Additional experts for the Ohio Environmental Council described how the solar farm and revenue from it could help local governments deal with climate change impacts.

“Given the risks Ohio faces from climate change, the board’s review of any application is incomplete without considering impacts,” said Karin Nordstrom, one of the Ohio Environmental Council’s lawyers in the case.

Adair welcomed the other parties’ supporting evidence and said he hopes to see the same level of scrutiny in future cases. ​“As long as the board continues to review projects on their merits and not fall prey to the misinformation, it’s encouraging,” he said.

Still, solar and wind projects continue to face hurdles under state law that don’t apply to fossil fuels. While counties now have the power to block most large solar and wind projects, local governments can’t even enforce zoning restrictions against oil and gas development.

“A lot of businesses are going to say, ​‘I’ll take my investment elsewhere,’” Adair said. And while some projects like Frasier may get approval, the combination of SB 52 and other deference to local governments ​“is going to leave you vulnerable to getting the supply that you need on the grid,” he added.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Knox-County-fields.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=2e97c8c5d9f79b44ddc18aa871167853,N,,2025-07-14 05:08:36.308090

There’s this irony: we are modifying the weather – it’s called climate change.","Good morning. The death toll from the catastrophic floods in Texas has climbed to 129, including at least 27 children and counsellors at Camp Mystic in Kerr County.

With more than 160 people still missing, authorities warn that the number of casualties is likely to rise. On Sunday morning, some search operations were cancelled as heavy rain and strong winds battered the state once again.

The flash floods, which swept through large parts of central Texas, are being described as one of the worst natural disasters in the state’s history. At Camp Mystic, rain gauges recorded 6.5in (16.5cm) of rainfall in just 180 minutes.

In addition to the human cost, the floods have caused widespread destruction. According to a preliminary estimate by private forecaster AccuWeather, the economic toll could range from $18bn to $22bn (£13.2bn to £16.2bn).

The floods struck as the climate crisis worsens, and as the Trump administration’s hollowing out of federal agencies has left critical services such as the National Weather Service under severe strain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is also facing continued threats of defunding.

Yet, despite the scale of devastation, there has been little public reckoning over climate breakdown or the erosion of essential public services. Instead, conspiracy theories have abounded.

To understand how this catastrophe unfolded and the political response to it, I spoke to Oliver Milman, the Guardian US environment reporter. That’s after the headlines.

Five big stories

Israel-Gaza | An Israeli airstrike has killed at least 10 people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water in Gaza, Palestinian health officials have said. Dozens of others were killed in Gaza over the weekend in a separate strike near a food aid distribution site. Meanwhile, former Israeli PM Ehud Olmert has said that a proposed “humanitarian city” would be a concentration camp for Palestinians.

Health | Health officials have urged people to come forward for the measles vaccine if they are not up to date with their shots after a child at Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool died from the disease.

UK news | Charlotte Church, veteran peace campaigners, Trade unionists, activists and politicians, are among hundreds who have signed a letter describing the move to ban the group Palestine Action as “a major assault on our freedoms”.

Spain | Several people were hurt in a second night of anti-migrant unrest in the town of Torre Pacheco in south-east Spain after a pensioner was beaten up, authorities said.

NHS | Health secretory Wes Streeting will meet representatives from the British Medical Association this week as he looks to avert five days of strikes by resident doctors.

In depth: What we know so far

The devastating floods began in the early hours of 4 July, Independence Day in the US. Oliver Milman told me that what started out as a seemingly small storm stalled in an area where two rivers in central Texas meet, and dumped an enormous amount of rain.

“It caused the river to burst its banks, swept away homes, cars, flooded rivers and, most tragically, caught up on Camp Mystic,” Oliver said. “There’s still hope that some people could be rescued, but it’s certainly going to be one of the biggest, deadliest natural disasters in recent US history.”

Oliver said there are several factors that could explain why this flood was so devastating. We also get into the responses from elected officials and other players.

How much of this is down to the climate crisis?

As the planet gets hotter, mostly because of humans burning fossil fuels, the atmosphere is able to hold more moisture. One meteorologist told Oliver that the Earth’s atmosphere is now like a giant sponge.

“You’ve got more moisture in the atmosphere, and more energy because it’s getting hotter, and therefore you’re getting more of these extreme precipitation events happening in several places around the world, including parts of the eastern US. But the western half of the US seems to be getting more drought,” Oliver said. “So, very crudely speaking, half the country’s not getting enough rain, and the other half is getting too much in these intense downpours.”

He pointed to some interesting statistics from the Environment Protection Agency: of the 10 heaviest precipitation single-day events in US history going back to 1910, nine have happened since 1995. “We’re clearly getting more and more of these events. There’s been research done showing they’re becoming more common in Texas and will continue to as the world heats up,” Oliver added.

The geography of central Texas also made the floods more catastrophic. “It’s hilly and has these canyons, lots of rivers, and not much topsoil. So when rain hits, it flies off the ground very quickly. It’s known as “Flash Flood Alley” in some places, so that was a factor. The rain hit, and the devastation followed.”

What impact have Donald Trump’s cuts had?

The other factor, which Oliver likened to a toxic cocktail, is the political situation in the US.

“The Trump administration has essentially tried to gut the federal workforce: firing scientists, firing weather forecasters, trying to eliminate large sections of the scientific agencies that deal with climate change. So you had a situation where a lot of National Weather Service offices, which track storms and issue warnings, were critically understaffed,” Oliver explained.

Democrats have called for an investigation into whether the sweeping cuts introduced by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), once led by Elon Musk, played any role in the disaster. The Trump administration has dismissed any suggestion that its policies had an impact.

“The Trump administration has pushed back quite hard and said this was an act of God, there were adequate resources, and so on,” Oliver said. Yet, understaffing was an issue and there was a disconnect between the meteorologists issuing warnings and the emergency services, he said.

“The National Weather Service issued a warning about dangerous flood conditions at 1.14am [on 4 July], but there wasn’t – and it’s still unclear why – coordination with emergency services to evacuate people, to mobilise resources in enough time. A lot of people are pointing fingers at the cuts Trump has made to the coordination services usually handled by the federal government.”

And it’s not just Trump that people are focusing on. The week before the floods, Texas senator Ted Cruz, ensured that the “big, beautiful bill”, a Republican spending bill pushed through and signed by Trump on Independence Day, would include particular cuts.

“It does a lot of things: cuts the social safety net, people lose health care, gives tax breaks to the wealthy, removes food assistance, guts support for clean energy,” Oliver said. “But one thing it also did was remove a $150m fund to improve weather forecasting at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Cruz personally inserted the language to cut that and then, tragically, just days later this storm hit his home state and killed many people. So there are a lot of questions being asked about his role and whether those cuts played a significant role.”

Republicans have largely fallen into line on the Texas floods, lavishing praise on Trump, while avoiding questions around the effect of Doge.

Has this moved the dial on the climate emergency?

In Texas, the reaction on the ground has been one of disbelief and devastation, Oliver said. “There’s a lot of ‘thoughts and prayers’ rhetoric in Texas right now, a sense of rallying to help those in need. People are mainly stunned rather than immediately pointing fingers, although local officials are raising questions about how much warning they got from the National Weather Service. There are also concerns about the local government’s actions. There had been a plan to install an early-warning flood system along the river, but the idea was ditched because it was considered too expensive. So you’ve got this local angle, too.”

Far-right players have descended on central Texas in a stunt they claim is part of a “disaster relief” effort. In a video posted by one group, they say their so-called “activists” are distributing supplies to survivors, but make clear that they are prioritising “their people” and “European peoples” in those operations.

As is now common when disaster strikes, conspiracy theories are being spread, Oliver said, by rightwing influencers and elected representatives such as Marjorie Taylor Greene. “They have questioned the cause [of the flood], whether it’s weather modification, cloud seeding, some nefarious machine. There’s this irony: we are modifying the weather – it’s called climate change. But it’s not the kind of weather modification they’re talking about.”

Oliver isn’t surprised by this reaction. “People are now able to live in their own realities, sealed off from facts,” he said. “Whatever people believed before the storm, the storm just reinforced it. That’s become a recurring theme, not just in disasters but in politics more broadly. People are very entrenched here. I know that’s also an issue in the UK and Europe, but in the US things feel paralysed. I don’t know if this will move anyone’s opinion.”

The Upside

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad

Social media can be brutal, but Brenda Allen is doing her bit to make it more benign. The 95-year-old, who lives in Cheshire, has proved a huge hit on TikTok. Her videos, in which she talks through her collection of Jellycat soft toys, have garnered more than 2m views, along with a flood of requests in the comments from people asking to adopt her as their gran.

Brenda is now planning to auction her collection of Jellycats in aid of a children’s hospice. Her daughter Julie said that the family had been “blown away” by her moment of internet fame.

During the 6-week training program, students rotate through 10 work-stations to gain hands-on skills in framing, electrical wiring, drywall installation, weatherization, insulation, painting and light fixture installation.
Oliveto said: “We build our program on a construction-based foundation with the green energy components weaved in, because green energy isn’t standalone.
In our program, students not only become part of a team, but they also develop real skills that make them feel confident and capable.”","A new workforce training program targeting young adults 18 years and older, was created to help ensure that all New Yorkers, including those in Disadvantaged Communities (DACs), are included in NYS’s clean energy future. The program is led by Liz Oliveto, WPWDB Youth Program Director in partnership with Training Provider Soulful Synergy to prepare 18 participants to enter the growing field of clean construction with confidence, competence, and purpose.

Funded by a New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) Office of Just Energy Transition (OJET) Renewable Energy Training Initiative (RETI) Grant, the program recognizes that climate change does not impact all communities equally. RETI funding provides:

The up-skilling or re-skilling of workers transitioning from fossil fuel to clean energy positions;

The up-skilling or re-skilling of residential workers in weatherization, building performance, and retrofitting, including fees for required industry-recognized credentials; and

Wraparound services during training, including but not limited to, childcare, transportation, housing, food, mental health services, and substance use treatment or services.

The Westchester, NY program, which launched in May and wraps up on July 11th, combines foundational construction certifications with specialized green building credentials and real-world hands-on experience. The initiative is designed not only for individuals new to the field but also for those seeking to reskill or upskill, providing a rare, flexible approach to clean energy workforce development.

Oliveto said: “Too often, workforce programs are linear and limited. This one is different. We’re giving participants not just a starting point, but a foundation and options for where they can go next, whether that’s further specialization in green building or jumping directly into a job. That kind of flexibility is rare.”

Foundations in Safety and Sustainability

Participants earn a comprehensive suite of 10 certifications, including OSHA 30, Fall Prevention, Drug & Alcohol Awareness, EPA Section 608, and the Building Performance Institute’s Principles of Building Science. The first three represent the Site Safety Training Card which is essential for anyone entering the construction field. It started as a New York City requirement but has since become standard in Westchester County and, as many employers work in both locations, it gives participants the flexibility to work in either. They also complete two certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council’s GPRO program, covering the fundamentals of green building and sustainable construction management.

During the 6-week training program, students rotate through 10 work-stations to gain hands-on skills in framing, electrical wiring, drywall installation, weatherization, insulation, painting and light fixture installation. These build-out exercises are designed to simulate real job site conditions.

Oliveto said: “We build our program on a construction-based foundation with the green energy components weaved in, because green energy isn’t standalone. It depends on traditional construction knowledge. You can’t install solar panels on a building without a proper roof. You need to understand how the building is put together before you can enhance its sustainability.”

Student participant Michael Novello said: “I’ve already experienced a lot of personal growth and am getting more confident in what I’m doing. I have a bit of background in a lot of what we’re learning, but it’s learning the right way to do it, understanding why we build the way we build. Also I love the teamwork. We work with different people every day and we learn to work together. It’s been a real positive experience.“

A Human-Centered Approach

What truly sets this program apart is its commitment to student support. With an exceptionally low student-to-instructor ratio, sometimes as low as 4:1, the program meets learners where they are. All participants face at least one significant barrier to employment, from financial hardship to lack of transportation. This training isn’t a typical classroom, and it’s not a typical staff either.

CEO and Director of Training, Soulful Synergy Alejandro Alvaraz said: “Thanks to the support from the grant and from Liz Oliveto, our instructors actually have the time and flexibility to support the students as individuals. Whether it’s emotional support, a practical resource like bus fare, or just someone to ask. ‘Have you eaten today?’—there’s someone available to do that. We have been very intentional about choosing empathetic, student-centered instructors which is why we retain students. If their basic needs aren’t met, they can’t focus on learning.”

The staff includes alumni of past training programs who now give back as instructors, creating a full-circle community of support and mentorship.

From Training to Career Placement

Job readiness is a key component of the curriculum. Participants receive career coaching in resume writing, interviewing, and how to present themselves in business settings. The ultimate goal: to place every graduate in a meaningful, good-paying clean energy job.

Alvarez said: “We want our students to walk into interviews with pride. They’ll be able to say, ‘I know these tools. I built this wall. I understand sustainable construction.’ That confidence makes all the difference.”

To date, several students have expressed interest in pursuing further training in areas like electrical work, while others are preparing to step directly into green energy jobs. Soulful Synergy is actively working to place graduates with employers across New York City and Westchester.

Alvaraz concluded: “People need a sense of purpose. People need to be part of a group with a shared purpose. People need to feel competent within that group—they need to feel they’re contributing something of value. That third piece is what’s often missing in traditional education. In our program, students not only become part of a team, but they also develop real skills that make them feel confident and capable.”",https://riverjournalonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Students-Michael-Novello-and-Daniel-Cruz-349x480.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 05:08:40.491325

The first one is a crumb rubber processing plant operated by PT Potensi Bumi Sakti, located in Glee Siblah Village, Woyla District, West Aceh. The second is Indonesia's first eco-friendly solder manufacturing facility, run by PT Solder Tin Andalan Indonesia (STANIA), situated in the Tunas Industrial Estate in Batam, Riau Islands.

Hashim, CEO of Arsari Group, noted that the Aceh rubber plant was a long-awaited project that began construction back in 2013 but only became operational in 2025 − nearly 12 years later.

“This might be the slowest-built factory in Indonesia,” Hashim said to laughter from the audience, as quoted by Antara, on Tuesday, July 8, 2025.

He attributed the delay to difficulties accessing bank credit during his time in political opposition, which made securing financing nearly impossible − even from local institutions like Bank Aceh. However, he expressed renewed optimism for future financing to support Indonesia’s economic growth.

The Aceh facility currently employs 200 workers, with the potential to scale up to two shifts, creating jobs for 400 to 600 people. The installed machinery can process 10 tons of wet rubber per hour or 5 tons of dry rubber daily. Once fully operational, it’s expected to process 100 tons of dry rubber per day, or roughly 30,000 tons annually, with operating costs reaching Rp4 billion (US$246,314) per day.

Meanwhile, the Batam-based solder plant under STANIA is built on a 6,500 square meter site and is capable of producing 2,000 tons of solder bars annually. Future expansion targets a capacity of 16,000 tons per year, including solder wire, powder, and paste products, with revenue projections of up to Rp1 trillion (US$61.6 million).

Currently, one production line employs 80 people, and expansion to four lines is planned as demand grows. “This is just one line for both leaded and lead-free solder. If demand increases, we’ll expand to four lines,” Hashim said.

The Batam factory emphasizes sustainability by using 100 percent renewable energy, certified by PLN’s Renewable Energy Certificate (REC), making it a zero-emission facility. The building is also designed to reduce electricity use through optimal natural lighting.

“Through eco-friendly technologies and strategic collaborations, we aim to show that the mining industry can also lead in sustainability,” Aryo Djojohadikusumo, President Director of Arsari Tambang, said.

On the supply chain side, STANIA has signed a Head of Agreement (HoA) with PT Freeport Indonesia to source lead and silver − two key components in high-quality solder production. Additionally, STANIA has partnered with Volex, a global connectivity solutions provider, to export solder product internationally.",https://cdn.indonesiabusinesspost.com/3/5/4/3/hashim-djojohadikusumo-image-source-katadata_300x206.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 05:08:46.012334

About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.
Indian air conditioners are inefficient Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.
“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.
Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — India’s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them.

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.

The Line 5 tunnel project has been under scrutiny from lawmakers, environmentalists and tribes in the Great Lakes region for more than a decade.
If the project is approved without proper analyses of climate change, other companies may have more leeway to cite the project and executive order as reasons for why NEPA considerations aren’t necessary, she said.

——— This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, https://insideclimatenews.org, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.","Groups submitting comments on the latest stage of the Enbridge Line 5 oil pipeline project in Michigan argue the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has failed to complete adequate analyses of climate change impacts and greenhouse gas emissions.

On May 30, the Corps’ Detroit district released its draft environmental impact statement for the Enbridge Energy Line 5 Tunnel Project, in which Canada-based energy company Enbridge would construct a 3.6-mile tunnel under the lakebed of the Straits of Mackinac that would house a replacement segment of Line 5, through which Enbridge transports 540,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.

Right now, 72-year-old dual pipelines run along the bottom of the straits en route from northwestern Wisconsin through Michigan into Sarnia, Ontario. It crosses both Dickinson and Iron counties in the region.

However, experts from the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network, which submitted joint comments on the project June 30, argue the draft EIS is inadequate, failing to take climate change into consideration and overlooking potential harms of the project.

“The biggest thing is that the Corps decided to entirely exclude any considerations of greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts that are associated with the tunnel project, and their reasoning for doing this was that it’s consistent with the executive order that President Trump issued earlier this year,” said Ellis Walton, an associate attorney at ELPC.

ELPC argued that the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, requires a deeper review than the Corps completed.

“NEPA the statute, as well as NEPA precedent … has established that federal agencies should be looking at foreseeable effects of major federal actions, and it’s pretty foreseeable that a tunnel project that extends the lifeline of (an oil) pipeline would have foreseeable climate impacts and foreseeably contribute to greenhouse gases and climate change,” Walton said. “It’s so important for the Corps to analyze these climate impacts and understand how we may be harming environmental quality now as well as in the future.”

Changes to NEPA rules were issued in late June by agencies including the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, Interior, Defense and Transportation “to simplify this overly burdensome process and ensure efficient and timely environmental reviews,” the White House said in a statement at the time.

That comes on the heels of a May 29 U.S. Supreme Court decision that gives the federal government more power to decide what to focus on in a NEPA review — and what to leave out. “Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote.

Keele and Walton said their groups are still reviewing the changes, but both expressed confidence that earlier precedents on NEPA will provide stable grounds for arguing against the project.

Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company supports and welcomes the public comment process now underway. “Public and stakeholder input is essential to the integrity of this process, and we look forward to hearing feedback, answering questions, and continuing to engage transparently with all interested parties,” Duffy said in a statement.

White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said the project is part of the Trump administration’s promise to unleash American energy to promote the economy and security while protecting natural resources.

“Line 5 is great for families in Michigan and Wisconsin, who benefit from quality jobs within the energy industry and lower costs from expanded pipelines,” Kelly said in a statement.

In comments to Inside Climate News, the Corps reiterated it removed the topics of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change from the draft EIS in accordance with the executive orders.

The Corps has said since 2023 that it would not evaluate climate impacts from the extraction and use of the pipeline’s products in its EIS of the Line 5 project. Although it initially said it would evaluate emissions from tunnel construction and operation, no such evaluation appears in the current draft EIS.

In that draft, the agency says greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and environmental justice are “Not Applicable” for the draft EIS because of Trump’s Jan. 20 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order and his move to rescind executive orders signed by Democratic presidents.

In the Corps’ executive summary of the draft EIS, the terms “climate change” and “greenhouse gas emissions” do not appear at all — although the term “emissions” is included, in each case related to local air quality.

Denise Keele, executive director of MiCAN, said her group argues the energy crisis cited in Trump’s executive order is not a true emergency. “The last time we checked, our fossil fuel industry was making record profits, and I don’t think there’s an emergency in getting fossil fuels out of the ground,” Keele said, adding that the “real emergency” is the potential impacts of climate change on human health and the environment that could result if the project is constructed.

The Corps also cited Trump’s order in April when announcing a truncated timeline for public comment on the project and its draft EIS, giving groups less time to review the statement and submit comments.

The normal comment period is 60 days, and for a project this big it is usually extended up to 90, Keele said. In this case, the period was 30 days.

The Line 5 tunnel project has been under scrutiny from lawmakers, environmentalists and tribes in the Great Lakes region for more than a decade. In 2020, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered the state Department of Natural Resources to revoke the permit allowing Enbridge to operate its dual pipelines in the straits. Enbridge challenged that decision with a lawsuit filed the same year. Attorneys for the state are still seeking to dismiss the challenge.

Another ongoing case, filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in 2019 against Enbridge, argues the 1953 permit for Line 5 was never valid. On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would take up the case to determine whether it belongs in state or federal court. Duffy said Enbridge is looking forward to the high court’s review.

Keele said another concern is the precedent that the project could set should it move forward. If the project is approved without proper analyses of climate change, other companies may have more leeway to cite the project and executive order as reasons for why NEPA considerations aren’t necessary, she said.

Meanwhile, Keele said, Michigan has been prioritizing a renewable energy economy–it set a goal to generate 60% of state electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Moving forward with Line 5, she said, would go against the state’s efforts to phase out fossil fuels.

“Michigan already knows it doesn’t want to suffer those climate impacts, and we’re moving in the other direction,” Keele said.

Despite global renewable energy capacity growing by 15% in 2024, some regions still get left behind, widening the transition gap across the world.

According to the Renewable Energy Statistics 2025 by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Asia continues to lead the shift, accounting for 71% of new renewables capacity in 2024. It is followed by Europe and North America, contributing 12.3% and 7.8%, respectively.

This leaves behind Africa, Eurasia, Central America and the Caribbean, which together accounted for 2.8% of total capacity addition. Despite its massive economic and development opportunities, Africa only increased its renewables capacity by 7.2%, IRENA said.

“Bridging the divide and closing the investment gap between countries and regions is critical. It requires targeted policies, international financing, and partnerships that unlock capital and technology where they are needed most,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera.

“By aligning investment flows with policy frameworks, we can ensure that the green transition becomes a powerful engine for resilience and sustainable economic growth worldwide,” he added.

Last year, the world added 582 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity. This is dominated by solar and wind power, which account for 97.5% of all net additions in 2024, with the former increasing by 453 GW, and the latter adding 114 GW.

Whilst it represents a record increase, it still falls short of the pace required to reach the global tripling target of 11.2 terawatts (TW) by 2030, RENA noted. If the same pace continues, the world will only reach 10.3 TW, missing the target by 0.9 TW.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community.","by Brian G. Henning, Gonzaga University, [This article first appeared in The Conversation, republished with permission]

In June 2021, a deadly heat wave pushed temperatures to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in Spokane, Washington, a northern city near the Idaho border where many homes weren’t built with central air conditioning.

As the heat lingered for over a week, 19 people died in Spokane County and about 300 visited hospitals with signs of heat-related illnesses.

Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region. To help save lives, the city teamed up with my university, Gonzaga, to start preparing for a hotter future.

We were excited and relieved when the community was awarded a US$19.9 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help it take concrete steps to adapt to climate change and boost the local economy in the process. The grant would help establish resilience hubs with microgrids and help residents without air conditioning install energy-efficient cooling systems. The city doesn’t have the means to make these improvements on its own, even if they would save lives and money in the long run.

Less than a year later, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the funding.

Spokane’s grant wasn’t the only one eliminated – about 350 similar grants that had been awarded to help communities across the country manage climate changes, from extreme heat and wildfire smoke to rising seas and flooding, were also terminated on the grounds that they don’t meet the White House’s priorities. Many other grants to help communities have also been terminated.

Many of the communities that lost funding are like Spokane: They can’t afford to do this kind of work on their own.

Why cities like Spokane need the help

Like many communities in the American West, Spokane was founded in the late 19th century on wealth from railroads and resource extraction, especially gold, silver and timber.

Today, it is a city of 230,000 in a metro area of a half-million people, the largest on the I-90 corridor between Minneapolis and Seattle. In many ways, Spokane could be on the cusp of a renaissance.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a $48 million grant to develop a tech hub that could put the Inland Northwest on a path to become a global leader in advanced aerospace materials. But then, in May, the Trump administration rescinded that grant as well.

The lost grants left the economy – and Spokane’s ability to adapt fast enough to keep up with climate changes – uncertain.

This is not a wealthy area. The median household income is nearly $30,000 less than the state average. More than 13 out of every 100 people in Spokane live in poverty, above the national average, and over 67% of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunch.

The city is a light blue island in a dark red sea, politically speaking, with a moderate mayor. Its congressional district has voted Republican by wide margins since 1995, the year that then-House Speaker Tom Foley lost his reelection bid.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome

The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community. The newly formed Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water and the Environment brought together a coalition of government and community partners to apply for the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program. The grants, funded by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, were intended to help communities most affected by pollution and climate change build adaptive capacity and boost the safety of their residents.

A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well. People just weren’t showing up. Our research found that the best approach is to strengthen existing community facilities that people already turn to in moments of difficulty.

Half the $19.9 million award was for outfitting five resilience hubs in existing libraries and community centers with solar arrays and battery backup microgrids, allowing them to continue providing a safe, cool space during a heat wave if the power shuts down.

Another $8 million in grant funding was meant to provide 300 low- to moderate-income homeowners with new high-efficiency electric heat pump heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, providing more affordable utility bills while improving their ability to cool their homes and reducing fossil fuel emissions.

Communities are left with few options

Now, this and other work is at risk in Spokane and cities and towns like it around the country that also lost funding.

According to the Trump administration, the program – designed to help hundreds of communities around the country become safer – was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

A class action lawsuit was recently filed over the termination of the grants by a coalition that includes Earth Justice and the Southern Environmental Law Center. If the case is successful, Spokane could see its funding restored.

Meanwhile, the city and my team know we have to move fast, with whatever money and other resources we can find, to help Spokane prepare for worsening heat. We formed the Spokane Community Resilience Collaborative – a partnership between community organizations, health officials and the city – as one way to advance planning for and responding to climate hazards such as extreme heat and wildfire smoke.

As concentrations of heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, both the frequency and severity of heat waves increase. It is only a matter of time before another deadly heat dome arrives.

The announcement was made in Riyadh on Sunday in the presence of the Minister of Energy, His Royal Highness, Prince AbdulAziz bin Salman bin AbdulAziz Al Saud, with power purchase agreements signed with the Saudi Power Procurement Company as the off-taker for all projects.

The development forms a crucial component of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 diversification strategy, with the Public Investment Fund (PIF) committed to delivering 70% of the nation's renewable energy targets by 2030.

The seven facilities include the 3,000 MW Bisha solar plant in Asir province, the 3,000 MW Humaij solar installation in Madinah, and 2,000 MW projects at Khulis in Makkah province and two sites in Riyadh province at Afif1 and Afif2. Wind energy capacity will be provided by the 2,000 MW Starah facility and 1,000 MW Shaqra plant, both located in Riyadh province.

Construction is expected to begin following financial closure in the third quarter of 2025, with projects becoming operational between the second half of 2027 and first half of 2028.

ACWA Power's CEO Marco Arcelli described the agreement as ""a significant milestone in Saudi Arabia's strategic vision for a more resilient and sustainable energy landscape"", whilst Badeel's Acting CEO Sultan AlNabulsi emphasised that, ""this investment will enhance the resilience of the energy sector nationally, positively impacting all other vital sectors of the national economy, and increasing the country’s investment attractiveness.""

Aramco's Senior Vice President of New Energies, Waleed Al Saif, said the company was ""delighted to expand our footprint in the renewables business"" and highlighted how the partnership would help ""build Saudi Arabia's renewable energy infrastructure""

The company officially inaugurated the first phase of the project in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia. The facility has an annual production capacity of 320,000 tonnes of green ammonia.

Zhang Lei, Envision’s founder and CEO, stated “This is more than a technological milestone. Scalable, green alternatives are now real and operational. We can’t get to net zero without green hydrogen, and we can’t afford to wait. This is the blueprint for a clean energy future.”

Plans for Expansion and Global Export

Envision announced that exports of green ammonia from the Chifeng plant will begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Looking ahead, the company plans to scale up production to 1.5 million tons per year by 2028, making it a cornerstone of China’s ambition to lead in green fuel technologies. s move aligns with Beijing’s strategic energy priorities. Hydrogen—along with its carriers ammonia and methanol—is now at the heart of China’s clean energy agenda, following its dominance in electric vehicles, solar panels, and battery manufacturing.

How Green Hydrogen is Produced

Unlike conventional hydrogen that relies on fossil fuels, green hydrogen is produced via electrolysis. This process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar. This method ensures zero carbon emissions, making it a key solution for decarbonising sectors like steel, cement, fertilisers, and shipping. According to China’s National Energy Administration, the country produced around 36.5 million tonnes of hydrogen in 2024, making it the world’s top producer. However, more than half of this volume still comes from fossil-fuel-based methods.

Stronger Policy Support for Green Fuels

At the beginning of 2025, Beijing ramped up policy support for green hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia. The move acknowledges their critical role in reducing emissions from traditionally hard-to-abate industries. The government’s push comes amid rising global demand for green fuels driven by the urgent need for energy transition to combat climate change.

Global Demand Set to Surge

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global hydrogen demand will rise by 1.5 times current levels by 2030, reaching about 150 million tons annually. New applications in the EU, East Asia, and the US are expected to drive a significant portion of this growth.

Strategic International Partnership

In May 2025, Envision Energy signed a long-term agreement with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation to supply green ammonia from the Chifeng facility. Industry leaders expect this deal to accelerate the adoption of clean fuels. Key sectors set to benefit include chemicals, fertilisers, and maritime shipping.

Driving Toward Cost Competitiveness

As reported by scmp.com, Envision aims to achieve price parity between its green ammonia and methanol and their fossil-fuel-based counterparts by 2028. This goal reflects the company’s broader vision to make green fuels economically viable and globally competitive.

With this project, Envision Energy is expanding China’s clean energy footprint.

Eni said in a media release that this initiative is part of Plenitude’s broader strategy, which identifies Energy Communities - specifically CER (Renewable Energy Communities), AUC (Collective Self-Consumption), and AID (Individual Remote Self-Consumption) - as an innovative and sustainable energy model.

These configurations offer businesses, citizens, and communities, within a local area, a platform to produce, consume, and share renewable energy, Eni said.

The AID project involves building a 758-kilowatt-peak photovoltaic plant, expected to generate approximately 860 megawatt-hours annually. Eni added that the energy produced will be virtually shared among five Nuova Simplast supply points.

The plant will be set up on an unused industrial lot owned by Nuova Simplast, next to its headquarters, and will distribute the renewable energy to nearby facilities. As a result of this project, Nuova Simplast will qualify for 20-year state incentives for Energy Communities. Part of these incentives will, as required by law, be used to support local social initiatives around the plant, Eni said.

Plenitude will support Nuova Simplast from design to the application for state incentives, providing its partner the Plenitude Comunità Energetiche digital platform to enable the management and monitoring of the AID configuration.

AID allows solar energy systems to be installed on surfaces other than traditional rooftops, overcoming potential structural limitations, Eni highlighted. This flexibility enables businesses to make use of unused industrial land or adjacent plots, optimizing space and energy production.

On a larger scale, locally produced and consumed renewable energy within the Energy Community alleviates pressure on the national power grid. By reducing peak demand, it contributes to increased grid stability and helps stabilize energy prices, Eni added.

About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.
Indian air conditioners are inefficient Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.
“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.
Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — India’s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them.

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.

This story was originally published by Vox.com and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In 2023, my husband and I bought our house in southwest Colorado, in part because it backed up to open space. That was the dream: trails just past the fence, a scrubby network of oak and sage stretching out into the hills beyond. But a little over a year into homeownership, I was questioning the wisdom of living so close to a burnable landscape.

This past winter’s spate of wildfires across Los Angeles made that fear of living alongside such a combustible landscape all the more real—fear that was only intensified by the weather. In my town, winter and its all important snow never really showed up. By spring, our snowpack was well below normal, winds were whipping, and I was becoming more paranoid about my wildfire risk.

It’s not just people like me—living on the edge of fire-prone terrain—who may be sharing that paranoia.

More than 100 million people across 20 states and Washington, DC, live in the path of the increasingly fierce hurricanes. Most of the eastern half of the country is now at risk for tornadoes, and floods have increased in frequency and intensity in both coastal areas and river valleys. Over the Fourth of July weekend, extreme flooding in central Texas was among the most deadly of the past century.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information found that 2024 held the second-most billion-dollar natural disasters ever for the US—right behind 2023. This year, with its already higher than average fire activity and predicted busy Atlantic hurricane season, is already shaping up to be significant, too.

At the same time, government cuts have undermined every critical juncture for disaster preparation. Federal programs for wildfire mitigation, proactive work like thinning forests and conducting prescribed burns, which help prevent large scale fires, have been halted due to staffing cutbacks and lack of funds.

Cutbacks to the National Weather Service, through reductions in force at NOAA, have already led to gaps in forecasting, which makes it harder for the public to plan for extreme weather events like the Texas Hill Country floods this month or the deadly May tornadoes, which killed at least 27 people as they swept across Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia.

And the agency explicitly tasked with disaster relief is shrinking. FEMA has cut funding for its bipartisanly popular Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, a major tool for building flood-resistant infrastructure, among other resiliency projects. It has lost some of its ability to help us recover, too. FEMA, already understaffed in 2024, has lost a third of its workforce since the beginning of the year. It has scaled back training and stands to lose $646 million in funding. As if that’s not enough, President Donald Trump has said he plans to phase out FEMA as a whole after the 2025 hurricane season

In the face of all that, I wanted to find out what all of us could do to limit our risk.

The first step was pretty basic: Instead of just spiraling about hypotheticals, figure out the specific risks in your area. For now, FEMA’s National Risk Index, where you can identify the threats to your community, remains a good source. By looking through the index, I learned my county is high in wildfire risks—which I already knew—but also that the area is prone to landslides, drought, and severe lightning storms.

Once I knew the risks, I looked at how I could prepare.

But the answers weren’t obvious. I reached out to both my regional FEMA office, whose contact was easy to find online, and the national headquarters, because I wanted to know what sort of concrete things I could do to protect my home—and what kind of support I might expect if the worst-case scenario happened to hit my community. I got a short email back saying that I should contact local authorities.

And so I started the real journey there, by looking at my local resources.

The most meaningful thing you can do on your own is harden your own home against relevant disasters. I found online that my local fire department provides free wildfire assessments because they think reducing your own vulnerability is one that can also reduce community risk. “The less time I have to spend at your house,” Scott Nielsen, my local wildfire battalion chief, told me, the more he can spend fighting other parts of the fire.

Nielsen says that when it comes to mitigating fire, we can’t change things like topography or weather, but we can change the fuel—and often that fuel includes our homes.

When Loren Russell, who works for the wildfire division of my regional fire district, came over to assess my risks, what he said surprised me: Instead of the overgrown hill behind the house, which had scared me, he was worried about nooks in the eaves or corners of the deck where embers could get caught. He also worried about the the oily junipers in the yard, which could become ladder fuels that might allow fire to leap to the tree canopies, and about the ways those canopies connected, spreading sparks across the landscape.

Russell says it’s always the same few things that create risk. Looking at the splintering boards of my neighbor’s fence, he noted that he’d seen fires blow across whole subdivisions through fences. “Once embers are in a fence it’s like a wick,” he says.

There are strategies for personal protection, too—and not just for fire. FEMA says that if you live in a hurricane-prone area, you can install impact resistant doors (particularly garage doors), storm shingles, and reinforced roof bracing, all of which help your house withstand storms. If you’re in a floodplain, you can seal cracks in your foundation, move your electrical boxes higher, or build berms and drains into your landscaping so water runs away from your home.

There can be a range of costs for those projects, from your own sweat equity for landscaping to tens of thousands of dollars for a new roof. But there can be grants and tools available to offset some of the cost, like Alabama’s program to help fund home strengthening, which is run through the state insurance office. Check your state resources, like the division of emergency management.

There’s no perfect formula for what to do. Russell says mitigation makes a real difference, but that risk is personal, because it’s also tied up in tolerance, and in trying to predict the future. “You go out and you build a concrete bunker and surround it with gravel, but,” he says, “now you live in a concrete bunker surrounded by gravel.”

Turning your home into a bunker is expensive, unappealing, and it might not make a difference in your broader risk tolerance. And unfortunately, it doesn’t really change your insurance liability. At least not yet.

My insurance agent told me that they don’t yet factor home hardening into their policies and pricing, even though simply being in a disaster-prone area can raise your premiums or make it harder to get insurance—and sometimes, insurance companies will simply dump policy holders in risk-prone areas. More than 100,000 Californians in fire-prone areas have lost their insurance in the past five years.

Those drops don’t necessarily reflect what’s happening on the ground. “We had one insurance agency that was pretty happy to drop people. I looked at their reports and didn’t find them to be based in fire science,” Nielsen says, about our area of western Colorado. He says they’re based on zip codes, which can be relatively arbitrary, instead of on the kind of terrain and fuel supply that actually make a difference to fires. And they almost never reflect mitigation work.

One of the only ways home hardening and mitigation makes a difference for insurance is when it’s done on a neighborhood scale. For instance, in 10 states, communities that have been certified as firewise through the National Fire Protection Association are able to get insurance discounts.

That is reflective of actual risk, “You really are impacted by your neighbor’s property,” says Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California Santa Barbara. He says that the LA wildfires showed just how much broader-scale hardening—or lack thereof—impacts risk. But regional tools, like consistent fire hazard mapping programs, or building code requirements for new construction can significantly reduce risk. That’s true of other natural disasters, too.

Nielsen says that landscape scale problems, like fire, need landscape scale solutions. Home hardening is a piece we can control, but it’s networked into a bigger system of land management, risk tolerance, and policy. When a tornado or a hurricane comes, it doesn’t just hit one house.

Nielsen thinks about what’s commonly called the Swiss cheese model of risk assessment, where multiple layers of protection. This includes everything from personal scale, like hardening your roof to withstand high force winds; to local and regional projects like floodplain mitigation or evacuation planning; to federal tools, like the National Weather Service, or FEMA, which apply to the whole country.

You can visualize each layer as a Swiss cheese slice in a sandwich. They all have holes, ideally, the gaps overlap, and the layers support one another—and stop a threat from becoming catastrophic.

That’s even more true for renters, or people who live in urban areas, who might not have as much control over their own homes, and who are even more impacted by the places around them. Hurricanes have wreaked havoc on major cities. If that’s you, ask your landlord what they’ve done to harden the property, ask about past damage, consider supplemental renters insurance and then get curious about municipal management like storm drains, which divert water away from housing, evacuation routes or fire mitigation, depending on your risks.

Having a lot of layers of swiss cheese is especially important now.

It’s all connected. Preventative mitigation is networked into a broader system, but so is dealing with disasters when they come, whether they’re fires, floods, or storms. Marshalling national resources during and after large-scale disasters has been a federal responsibility since the 1970s. That kind of coordinated response is part of how we plan for natural disasters, but the current administration is planning to cut the budget and scope of FEMA and turn responsibility toward state and local governments, which aren’t always funded or prepared to manage large incidents.

The scientists and field workers I spoke to for this story told me they were worried about the lack of federal investment. Moritz says that he’s concerned about disaster response, but he’s also worried about understanding future preparedness. “Some of the big questions that we don’t have answers for yet rely on big labs and national level funding,” he says. “Research wise, a lot of Forest Service colleagues who do really good work in federal labs have been let go, or lost staff. Those are serious losses that will take a long time to get back from.”

He says that there are still big gaps in the research about exactly how home hardening fits into the puzzle of resilience, and what kind of choices are the most effective, but that in the face of that federal lack of support, the sort of things we can do individually or as a neighborhood collective become even more important.

When there are several fires burning at once—like in Los Angeles earlier this year—responding agencies are spread thin and every person might not be able to depend on their help, Mortiz told me. That makes education shared among neighbors even more important. “That’s the scale you can make a difference,” he said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25010813123789.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-14 04:06:14.505073

STATEMENT OF SENATOR PIA S. CAYETANO

On recent government efforts to curb illegal online gambling

I commend the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for taking concrete steps to hold content creators accountable for promoting illegal online gambling. The agency's Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center has ordered influencers to remove these materials. Their coordination with social media platforms shows a clear intent to enforce accountability.

Likewise, I welcome the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation's (PAGCOR) directive to remove all gambling-related billboards and other public advertisements nationwide. This move to limit the aggressive promotion of gambling is a critical step in creating a safer and more responsible environment for all, especially our youth.

Online gambling has become a silent epidemic, thriving in plain sight and quietly tearing at the fabric of the Filipino family. Students are gambling away their allowances, employees are placing bets during work hours, and parents are left to deal with the consequences of broken trust, addiction, and mounting debt. With smartphones making this vice accessible 24/7, even to minors, it now reaches into our homes, classrooms, and workplaces. What may be thought of as a harmless distraction often spirals into a destructive cycle of dependency and despair.

This is why among the priority bills I filed for the 20th Congress includes the ""Ban on Online Gambling Act"" to explicitly prohibit online gambling in all its forms-especially gambling through e-wallets, restrict its promotion on social media, and raise public awareness about its harms. I will continue to push for policies that protect families, educate the youth, and hold enablers accountable.

I also call on payment platforms like e-wallet providers to take the responsible path and stop enabling these gambling ventures. If we are serious about addressing this issue, everyone--from regulators to service providers--must act in the interest of public welfare.

Let us not allow this vice to quietly take root in our daily lives. The time to act is now.",,N,,2025-07-14 04:06:00.304879

(ENB) stands out as a compelling investment opportunity. The Canadian energy infrastructure giant is undervalued relative to its peers, thanks to underappreciated cash flow resilience and a robust pipeline of growth projects in the U.S. and Canada. Let's dissect why now could be a pivotal moment for this under-the-radar stock.

The Cash Flow Engine: Strong and Expanding

Enbridge's financial health is its cornerstone. In Q1 2025, Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) surged 9% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, driven by record Mainline pipeline throughput (3.2 million barrels per day) and contributions from recent acquisitions like U.S. gas utilities. With DCF comfortably covering its $0.94-per-share dividend (implying a DCF-to-dividend ratio of ~6x), the company's payout remains secure.

Meanwhile, Adjusted EBITDA hit $5.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, fueled by toll escalators on its liquids pipelines and colder weather boosting gas distribution revenue. Even as interest expenses and maintenance capex rose, Enbridge's financial discipline kept its debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 4.9x—within its 4.5–5.0x target range.

Growth Projects: Fueling Future Cash Flows

Enbridge's expansion pipeline is its secret sauce. Key projects include:

1. Mainline System Expansion: Adding 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of incremental capacity by 2027, with $2 billion allocated through 2028. This will transport more oil from Alberta to U.S. refiners, capitalizing on strong Permian Basin production growth.

2. Ingleside Energy Center: Storage capacity is expanding to 20.1 million barrels by year-end, while new marine docks will enhance exports to Asia. The adjacent Houston Oil Terminal (EHOT), coming online in 2026, adds 2.5 million barrels of storage and integrates with the Gray Oak Pipeline.

3. Gray Oak Pipeline: Capacity is being expanded by 120,000 bpd by early 2026, supporting rising Permian crude volumes (projected to grow by 2 million bpd by 2030).

These projects are not speculative; many are already under construction or secured via open seasons. For example, the Southern Illinois Connector, part of the Mainline expansion, concluded its open season in July 2025 with strong shipper commitments.

Valuation: A Discounted Growth Story

Despite its strong fundamentals, Enbridge trades at a 13.3x EV/EBITDA multiple, below its historical median of 15.3x and well below the industry's median of 6.3x. This mispricing is puzzling given its stable cash flows and growth profile.

Compare Enbridge to peers like Chevron (CVX) or TotalEnergies (TTE), which trade at 6–8x EV/EBITDA. Enbridge's higher multiple reflects its growth-heavy asset mix, but it's still attractively priced given its DCF visibility and low-risk projects.

Risks and Mitigants

Regulatory Delays: The proposed Alberta-to-Prince Rupert pipeline, which would transport 1 million bpd of oil sands crude to the Pacific Coast, faces hurdles like Indigenous land claims and federal tanker bans. While a 2030 timeline is likely, this project is not central to near-term cash flows.

Oil Price Volatility: Lower oil prices could reduce demand for infrastructure. However, Enbridge's fee-based model (revenue tied to volumes, not commodity prices) insulates it from price swings.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Discount, Play the Growth

Enbridge is a rare blend of stability and growth. Its cash flows are resilient, its projects are shovel-ready, and its valuation is undemanding. With a DCF-to-enterprise-value ratio of 3.5% (higher than most midstream peers), investors get paid to wait for growth to materialize.

Actionable Takeaway:

- Hold: For long-term investors seeking steady dividends (yield ~6.5%) and exposure to North American energy infrastructure.

- Buy: If the stock dips below $40, given its $5.50–$5.90 annual DCF guidance.

Final Word

Enbridge is a testament to the adage that infrastructure wins in uncertain times. With a $29 billion growth backlog, a fortress balance sheet, and projects aligned with both oil demand and renewable energy goals (e.g., offshore wind in France), it's a play on energy transition—and a bargain at current prices.

In a sector rife with volatility, Enbridge offers a rare mix of safety and upside. For investors willing to look beyond the headlines, this could be the energy stock to watch.

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.

POWER HUNGRY CHATBOTS Over the past few years, a confluence of events have resulted in skyrocketing power capacity rates at PJM.
Among those, auctions were repeatedly delayed as regulators mulled multiple rule changes at PJM, giving developers less time to plan for power plant construction.
Tech giants started scouring the US power grid for capacity, contributing to the spike in auction prices in 2024.","America’s largest power grid is under strain as data centers and AI chatbots consume power faster than new plants can be built.

Electricity bills are projected to surge by more than 20 per cent this summer in some parts of PJM Interconnection’s territory, which covers 13 states – from Illinois to Tennessee, Virginia to New Jersey – serving 67 million customers in a region with the most data centers in the world.

The governor of Pennsylvania is threatening to abandon the grid, the CEO has announced his departure and the chair of PJM’s board of managers and another board member were voted out.

The upheaval at PJM started a year ago with a more than 800 per cent jump in prices at its annual capacity auction. Rising prices out of the auction trickle down to everyday people’s power bills.

Now PJM is barreling towards its next capacity auction on Wednesday, when prices may rise even further.

The auction aims to avoid blackouts by establishing a rate at which generators agree to pump out electricity during the most extreme periods of stress on the grid, usually the hottest and coldest days of the year.

High prices out of the auction should spur new power plant construction, but that hasn’t happened quickly enough in PJM’s region as aging power plants continue to retire and data center demand explodes.

PJM has made the situation worse by delaying auctions and pausing the application process for new plants, according to more than a dozen power developers, regulators, energy attorneys and other experts interviewed by Reuters.

“We need speed from PJM, we need transparency from PJM and we need to keep consumer costs down with PJM,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told Reuters in an interview. “I think they’ve taken some steps in that direction which is really encouraging to me and we’re going to continue to work at it.”

PJM says the supply and demand crunch has been caused largely by factors outside of its control, including state energy policies that closed fossil-fuel fired power plants prematurely and data center growth in “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia and other burgeoning hubs in the Mid-Atlantic.

“Prices will remain high as long as demand growth is outstripping supply – this is a basic economic policy,” said PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields. “Right now, we need every megawatt we can get.”

New projects totaling about 46 gigawatts – enough capacity to power 40 million homes – have been cleared in recent years, “but are not getting built because of local opposition, supply chain backups or financing issues that have nothing to do with PJM,” Shields said.

PJM has lost more than 5.6 net gigawatts in the last decade as power plants shut faster than new ones enter service, according to a PJM presentation filed with regulators this year. PJM added about 5 gigawatts of power-generating capacity in 2024, fewer than smaller grids in California and Texas.

Meanwhile, data center demand is surging. By 2030, PJM expects 32 gigawatts of increased demand on its system, with all but two of those gigawatts coming from data centers.

POWER HUNGRY CHATBOTS

Over the past few years, a confluence of events have resulted in skyrocketing power capacity rates at PJM.

Among those, auctions were repeatedly delayed as regulators mulled multiple rule changes at PJM, giving developers less time to plan for power plant construction.

In 2022, PJM stopped processing new applications for power plant connections after it was overloaded with more than 2,000 requests from renewable power projects, each of which required engineering studies before they could connect to the grid. PJM says its interconnection queue has not led to the supply shortfall.

Then, in 2023, ChatGPT became a household name and demand exploded. Tech giants started scouring the US power grid for capacity, contributing to the spike in auction prices in 2024.

Consumer advocates from Maryland, New Jersey and other states filed complaints with federal regulators, asking for a re-do of the auction.

Shapiro has made repeated threats to remove Pennsylvania, the biggest electricity exporting state and the “P” in PJM, from the grid if it didn’t bring costs down. Asked in June if leaving PJM is still on the table, the governor told Reuters: “It is.”

During the fallout, PJM’s CEO Manu Asthana announced in April that he would leave his post at the end of the year, citing a family move to Texas.

Asthana did not respond to requests for comment.

Citing fears of blackouts, the Trump administration in May ordered two oil and natural gas power plants in Pennsylvania, both scheduled to retire in May, to continue operating through the summer.

CONNECTION DELAYS

In response to the backlash, PJM has made multiple reforms, including capping prices at $325 per megawatt-day and holding auctions every six months instead of annually, Shields said.

PJM also moved to fast-track connections of 51 power projects to its system, but many of those are still expected to take until 2030 or 2031 to come online.

Among them is Constellation Energy’s Three Mile Island nuclear plant, rechristened Crane Clean Energy Center, which is being restarted under contract from Microsoft. Even under PJM’s expedited plan, the plant isn’t expected to start up until at least 2027.

Despite the reforms, PJM isn’t processing new applications fast enough, said Joshua Macey, an energy expert and associate professor at Yale Law School. “It’s pointless if they haven’t fixed the interconnection queue,” he said.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/energy-plant.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 05:10:31.008994

As the 2024–2025 political cycle unfolds, the U.S. clean energy industry is acting like it’s in a race against the clock.","Introduction: Policy Whiplash Fuels a Renewable Rush

The U.S. renewable energy sector is experiencing a paradoxical surge. While long-term clarity is clouded by shifting political winds and looming legislative threats, short-term deployment of clean energy technologies is accelerating. Developers, manufacturers, and utilities are racing to lock in federal tax credits, finalize financing, and break ground on projects before any potential rollback of incentives or regulatory shifts materialize.

This phenomenon, what some are calling a “policy-induced urgency, ” is a defining feature of the current renewable energy landscape. With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) still largely intact but increasingly under scrutiny, stakeholders are seizing the moment. On July 4, 2025, the U.S. Congress passed and President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB, H.R.1). This sweeping tax package includes provisions that accelerate the phase-out of critical clean energy tax credits. In response, developers are front-loading activity, driving record-breaking quarters in manufacturing, construction, and energy storage.

This article explores how uncertainty about U.S. climate and energy policy is paradoxically fueling a short-term boom. It examines five key areas where action has accelerated in recent months, driven not just by incentives, but by the fear of losing them.

Surging Solar Manufacturing: A Preemptive Sprint

One of the most direct outcomes of recent policy ambiguity has been the record-breaking surge in solar module manufacturing capacity. According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. added 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module capacity in Q2 2025, one of the strongest quarters in U.S. history. Developers are moving fast to capture tax credits before potential reversals.

The trigger? The BBB legislation outlines a sharp sunset for many renewable incentives. The Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) will now expire on December 31, 2025, cutting short its original duration. Similarly, the Commercial Investment Tax Credit (Section 48) for solar and wind will terminate after December 31, 2027. Although these dates leave a short window for deployment, the compressed timeline has caused manufacturers to accelerate operations dramatically.

This flurry of activity demonstrates the fragile confidence in long-term federal support. Manufacturers are hedging against risk by compressing what might have been a five-year plan into the next 12–18 months.

Battery Storage Builds Soar Amid Credit Clock Watching

The same urgency is seen in energy storage. With federal tax credits for standalone storage newly introduced via the IRA, developers are rushing to complete projects while the regulatory environment still favors rapid deployment.

In Nevada, the Reid Gardner Battery Energy Storage System, a 220 MW / 440 MWh project, was recently commissioned with the help of $100 million in federal support. Across the country, similar projects are being fast-tracked. Developers anticipate that changes in Congress could revise credit structures or add new compliance burdens, reducing the economic attractiveness of new builds.

Under BBB, standalone and retrofit battery credits (under Section 48E) remain technically available through 2032, but eligibility is narrowed to leased or PPA-tied systems, and cross-subsidies are under review. As a result, developers are bundling battery projects with solar deployments to maximize near-term credit access.

Recent Utility-Scale Battery Storage Projects (Q4 2024–Q2 2025)

This rush to deploy before the “policy window” closes is producing what the U.S. Energy Information Administration calls a “2025 supercycle” in battery installations, growth that is unlikely to persist at the same pace without long-term policy stability.

Offshore Wind Races to Approval Before Regulatory Shifts

While solar and storage are seeing development peaks, the offshore wind sector is undergoing a fast-tracked permitting spree. The Biden administration, via the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), has accelerated project reviews, approving multiple multi-gigawatt developments in recent months.

Notable examples include:

Maryland Offshore Wind (US Wind) – 2.2 GW project approved in December 2024

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind – 2.6 GW under construction, 50% complete

Sunrise Wind (New York) – 924 MW began turbine installations in early 2025

These projects are being shepherded through while federal support remains robust, but developers acknowledge the precariousness of the moment. Under BBB, the commercial ITC for offshore wind will expire after December 31, 2027, and developers must begin construction by mid-2026 to qualify. These deadlines are pushing utilities to speed up permitting and equipment contracts.

As one executive noted, “We are trying to get everything locked down while we still can count on the rules not changing.” This sense of urgency is driving permitting acceleration and supply chain finalizations.

Manufacturers Hedging Bets With Accelerated Factory Builds

The IRA’s domestic content incentives were designed to bring clean energy manufacturing back to U.S. soil, and they’ve succeeded. But with BBB curtailing the duration of these benefits, manufacturers are pushing to begin production before the window closes.

Since 2022, over 120 new clean tech factories have been announced in the U.S. These include solar cell fabs, battery gigafactories, and EV component plants. In the first half of 2025 alone, $34 billion in new investments were publicly committed, most aiming to begin operations before 2027.

Table 2: Selected U.S. Clean Energy Manufacturing Announcements (H1 2025)

These companies are front-loading capital expenditures to ensure eligibility for IRA credits, and to establish market presence before political tides turn. The result: a short-term spike in economic activity, jobs, and industrial output that may taper if uncertainty persists.

Conclusion: Racing Against the Clock

The U.S. renewable energy sector is experiencing a rare alignment of incentives and anxiety. Strong policies like the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are catalyzing clean energy growth, but political developments such as the BBB are injecting new uncertainty into the system. Rather than stall activity, this has triggered a short-term boom, as developers and manufacturers rush to capitalize on current rules before they potentially disappear.

This dynamic is unsustainable in the long run. Bursts of growth followed by periods of uncertainty make it difficult for supply chains to stabilize, for skilled labor to be developed, and for communities to trust the energy transition. Nonetheless, in the short term, policy instability has become an accelerator rather than a brake.

As the 2024–2025 political cycle unfolds, the U.S. clean energy industry is acting like it’s in a race against the clock. The outcome will determine whether the recent boom is a foundation for long-term resilience, or merely a surge before a slowdown.

The development follows collaboration with Dr Binesh Puthen Veetti and his team at Macquarie University, who have pioneered new silver extraction technology.

The company has secured global rights to the university’s proprietary “Microwave Joule Heating Technology” (MJHT), designed to recover metals from solar panel waste. The technology enables energy-efficient recovery of valuable materials from discarded solar panels.

Alongside silver, solar panels also contain other critical elements such as silicon, gallium and indium — metals vital to advanced semiconductor manufacturing and renewable energy systems.

Silver fingers and busbars on a solar panel transport electricity.

The company is also preparing to assess a new silver extraction process developed by the same university team. This secondary technology is distinct from MJHT and will be formally presented to Lithium Universe after patent finalisation.

Silver demand is forecast to reach a record 680 million ounces in 2025, with industrial use growing at a 7% compound annual growth rate. A supply deficit of around 117.6 million ounces is expected. Since 2018, silver prices have surged by 126% to US$34 per ounce, highlighting the economic incentive to recover the metal from solar waste.

“While solar panels contain many critical metals and minerals, the follow-up extraction of these materials needs to be prioritised. Due to the large volume of residual material, rising prices, and supply shortages, the company plans to focus on silver extraction as the first phase. Once we address silver extraction, we can then explore the extraction and recovery of other critical metals like silicon, indium, and gallium — critical in advanced semiconductor and solar energy technologies.”

Surging silver demand driven by solar energy boom

Silver demand is rapidly escalating, underpinned by its critical role in solar panel manufacturing. Each panel typically contains about 20 grams of silver, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 8 grams per square metre. At a spot price of US$34 per ounce, the silver content equates to approximately A$36 per panel.

Silver 10-year price trend.

Silver demand driven by PV cells.

Photovoltaics (PV) have become a major consumer of silver, and their growing deployment — particularly in markets such as Australia — is intensifying demand. Australia’s target of 82% renewable energy generation by 2030, alongside a planned 43% cut in emissions, is driving large-scale solar adoption.

The global industrial demand for silver is forecast to grow at 7% annually, with total consumption expected to reach a record 680 million ounces in 2025. PV and artificial intelligence (AI) are now among the fastest-growing sectors driving this expansion.

Silver remains both costly and finite, primarily sourced from argentite ores via smelting or chemical processing. However, production has not kept pace with rising consumption. A projected market shortfall of around 117.6 million ounces in 2025 continues a pattern of deficits that has placed upward pressure on prices.

Reflecting these dynamics, silver prices have surged 126% over the past seven years, rising from US$15 per ounce in 2018 to US$34 per ounce in 2025.

Potential silver extraction technology to complement MJHT platform

In June 2025, Lithium Universe entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Macquarie University for its MJHT, a platform that employs targeted microwave energy to selectively heat silicon wafers within photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, softening the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) thermoplastic encapsulant. This process enables efficient room-temperature delamination, allowing for the recovery of valuable materials without the extreme heat (up to 1,400°C) or hazardous chemicals typically used in conventional recycling methods.

The delamination approach avoids mechanical crushing, reducing material cross-contamination and improving recovery efficiency.

As a follow-on to this process, Macquarie University’s Dr Binesh and his research team have developed a complementary silver extraction technology tailored for delaminated silicon wafers derived from the MJHT process. This silver recovery method is currently undergoing patent submission. Upon completion, the licence for the new technology will be offered to Lithium Universe.

While the company has not yet formally assessed the new silver extraction technology, it has initiated independent research and patent investigations to identify the most effective methods for recovering silver from end-of-life solar panels.

Why silver recycling is a lucrative opportunity

Global solar panel waste is projected to surge from 8 million tonnes in 2030 to between 60 and 78 million tonnes by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). In Australia alone, the accumulated waste is expected to reach 1 million tonnes by 2035, equating to an estimated value of over A$1 billion. Despite the scale of this challenge, only 15% of used photovoltaic (PV) cells are currently recycled, with the majority sent to landfill due to costly, inefficient methods that require high heat and hazardous chemicals.

The silver content in solar modules offers a compelling case for change. Each panel contains around 20 grams of silver — approximately A$36 at current prices. The Australian Smart Energy Council notes that the aggregate silver in these panels is equivalent to the output of Australia’s largest silver mine. As demand for silver accelerates in sectors such as electronics and renewable energy, this underutilised resource presents a significant and scalable recycling opportunity.

Lithium Universe aims to capitalise on this opportunity.

Unlocking value from critical and strategic metals

In its second phase, LU7 plans to explore recovery pathways for other critical metals found in PV panels, including silicon, gallium and indium. These materials are vital to both the clean energy transition and advanced semiconductor applications. However, their supply chains are concentrated, with China accounting for around 80% of global gallium output and over 60% of indium production.

Gallium is primarily obtained as a by-product of aluminium smelting, while indium is produced during zinc mining. Other sources include Germany, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine (gallium), and Canada and Peru (indium), with refining activity centred in Japan and South Korea.

Given their strategic importance and supply risk, domestic recycling of these metals from end-of-life solar panels offers potential for both economic resilience and technology sovereignty.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzA3XC8yMDI1LTA3LTE0LTExLTI2LTU2LTEwZDM3MGNiYTc4M2I2NTBlNDFkM2NmNWRkMGUzOTc0LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-07-14 06:11:42.037890

However, Northvolt is just a typical example of the huge amount of money spent by the European battery industry.
If abandoned halfway, it will bring a heavier transformation burden to the European automobile industry.
The low - risk production capacities of the two countries reach 115 GWh and 125 GWh respectively.
Since last year, more and more European automobile manufacturers have slowed down the electrification process.","The European Federation for Transport and Environment (T & E for short) recently released a research report titled ""European Automobiles at a Crossroads"". The report points out that the European automobile industry is at a critical juncture. Whether the ""combustion engine ban"" proposal is advanced or delayed will have completely different impacts and directions on the entire industry.

On the one hand, there has been an obvious chain reaction of declining sales of electric vehicles in Europe. According to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), the sales of electric vehicles in the EU decreased by 5.9% in 2024, and this year they also face the threat of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. With pure electric vehicles not selling well for a long time, the plan to stop selling fuel - powered vehicles in the 27 EU countries by 2035 has cast a new shadow.

On the other hand, if no remedial measures are taken and the EU abandons the goal of banning the sale of fuel - powered vehicles within its territory by 2035, the entire European automobile industry may lose 1 million jobs. Most of the efforts made for ""zero - emissions"" will go to waste, and the investment losses in new energy sectors such as batteries will be as high as two - thirds.

It's a dilemma of neither advancing nor retreating.

In the strategy of electrification transformation, the EU has found itself in an awkward situation. Due to the sluggish sales of pure electric vehicles, many automobile manufacturers have successively lowered their short - and medium - term sales targets, forcing the EU to have room to relax the carbon dioxide emission targets. However, to date, the EU still adheres to the established plan of completely banning the sale of fossil - fuel vehicles by 2035.

This report from T & E clearly supports the continuous advancement of the ""combustion engine ban"". The report comments that if the EU adheres to the clean energy target for 2035 and implements the transitional policies, the European automobile industry is expected to return to the level of producing 16.8 million new vehicles per year, reaching the peak level after the 2008 economic crisis.

In a nutshell, if the ""combustion engine ban"" is abandoned halfway, the sunk costs will be extremely high, and there is also a risk of large - scale unemployment. T & E data shows that if the EU maintains the ""combustion engine ban"" target for 2035 and implements a package of policies to promote the development of emerging industrial chains, by 2035, the contribution of the automobile industry to the European economy will increase by 11%.

Employment and Industrial Chain Value

To support the continuous advancement of the ""combustion engine ban"", the T & E report presents several important data:

If the EU can implement the ""combustion engine ban"" until 2030, the job losses in the traditional automobile manufacturing field may be offset by more than 100,000 jobs created in new electrification fields such as batteries. By 2035, the number of jobs in the new energy field of the automobile industry will reach 120,000, mainly concentrated in industrial chains such as batteries and electric drives.

As long as Europe can ensure a battery manufacturing capacity of more than 900 GWh, it can create more than 100,000 new jobs, and the number of jobs created will reach 120,000 by 2035. In addition, the economic output of the battery industrial chain will increase to about five times, reaching 79 billion euros.

The report points out that if the established ""combustion engine ban"" target is weakened, or if the EU's policies waver and there is a lack of a comprehensive industrial transformation plan, by 2035, the economic contribution of the automobile industry may decrease by 90 billion euros (equivalent to about 758 billion yuan), and the economic contribution of the charging market will accumulate a loss of 20 million euros (equivalent to about 168 million yuan).

Regarding the sunk costs of the industrial chain, T & E conducted a study on 13 new electric vehicle projects in Europe. Among them, 5 projects are brand - new electric vehicle factories, and the remaining 8 are transformed from existing fuel - powered vehicle production lines.

If all the projects are successfully implemented, Europe will add at least 2.1 million electric vehicle production capacities annually, and the total production is expected to reach 5.1 million by 2027, which is sufficient to meet the growing market demand. This figure will be achieved on the basis of the 1.8 million production in the whole of Europe in 2024. According to T & E statistics, the sales of pure electric vehicles in Europe (including the EU, the UK, European Free Trade Association countries, and Serbia) were about 2 million in 2024, while the production was close to 1.8 million in the same year.

However, due to the uncertainty of the future market prospects and policies, some projects face the risk of delay or even cancellation. T & E evaluated all 13 projects based on four key criteria, including the project status (delayed/started/testing phase), construction progress (not started/under construction/completed), whether the factory site is determined, and whether there is a government subsidy commitment. According to the evaluation results, these 13 projects are divided into three risk levels: low, medium, and high, to reflect the possibility of investment implementation.

The low - risk projects include the BMW factory in Hungary and the Volvo factory in Slovakia, both of which are brand - new; as well as the Stellantis factory in Serbia and the Volkswagen and Chery factories in Spain, which are converted from existing fuel - powered vehicle production capacities to electric vehicle production capacities. These projects will form a total annual production capacity of 550,000 vehicles, drive an investment of about 4.8 billion euros, and create at least 5,550 jobs.

The medium - risk projects have a total planned annual production capacity of 1.2 million vehicles, involve an investment of 9.3 billion euros, and can support 11,000 jobs. Among them, BYD's Szeged factory in Hungary, with an investment of 4 billion euros, accounts for nearly half of the total, making it the largest project on the list; followed by the transformation project of the Seat - Volkswagen factory in Spain, with a cumulative investment of 3 billion euros; and the upgrading production bases of Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan in the UK, which are expected to produce a total of 250,000 electric vehicles annually, similar to the plan of the Volvo factory in Gothenburg.

The high - risk projects include three, all of which are in the early development stage, or there are still uncertainties about the final investment decision or start - up date. Among them, there is the suspension of the 700 - million - euro electrification transformation of the Oxford MINI factory by BMW, and the plan to build a factory in Serbia through a joint venture between Renault and China's Jiangling.

Batteries and Supporting Facilities

What needs to be weighed between sunk costs and strategic shifts is not only the vehicle manufacturing but also the huge investment in key components such as batteries.

Previously, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) statistics showed that China currently supplies about 80% of the world's lithium - ion batteries. Six of the world's top 10 electric vehicle battery manufacturers are from China. Europe has invested 36 billion US dollars (equivalent to 232 billion yuan) in the development of automotive power batteries, but 12 out of 16 local battery factories have encountered production delays or cancellations, and the situation is not optimistic.

Northvolt, once hailed as the ""light of European batteries"", applied for bankruptcy protection in Sweden. After burning through 14 billion US dollars (equivalent to about 100 billion yuan), it withdrew dejectedly, marking a huge setback for Europe's ambition to challenge China in the field of power batteries. However, Northvolt is just a typical example of the huge amount of money spent by the European battery industry. In addition to this well - known star company, Europe has also spent a lot of money on other battery companies in the past few years and gradually established its own battery energy storage industrial chain. If abandoned halfway, it will bring a heavier transformation burden to the European automobile industry.

Similarly, T & E evaluated the battery factories in Europe based on multiple key criteria, and the data shows that:

The low - risk battery factories have all received the necessary funds and have started construction. Some factories have even been put into production, which will bring an annual production capacity of 391 GWh to Europe, with an investment of 39 billion euros and the creation of up to 43,000 technical jobs. The ACC factory in Douvrain, France, and the Volkswagen PowerCo project in Salzgitter, Germany, belong to this category.

The medium - risk projects have not started construction mainly because the final investment decision has not been made. This is currently the largest category in the European battery field, involving an annual production capacity of 627 GWh, an investment of 48 billion euros, and 47,000 potential jobs. Compared with low - risk projects, there are many uncertainties in this type of factories. A representative project is Basquevolt in Spain, where most of the production capacity will be allocated to emerging fields such as solid - state batteries.

The high - risk projects are still in the conceptual or approval stage. Although they will include a total annual production capacity of 410 GWh, an investment of 21 billion euros, and 37,000 job opportunities, their advancement completely depends on subsequent industrial policies.

T & E analysis shows that in terms of actual expected output (not theoretical capacity), Europe's local production capacity may meet two - thirds of its local battery demand by 2030.

However, if only the low - risk projects are finally implemented, this proportion will drop sharply to 24%, far lower than the EU's 2030 target of 40% self - sufficiency rate. After including the medium - risk projects, the self - sufficiency rate can reach 52%, but this figure is also lower than the previous estimates of T & E and the EU. Affected by unfavorable global and EU factors (such as insufficient industrial support), many battery projects are at risk of cancellation or delay.

Taking Spain as an example, in terms of policy support, the country has shown great development potential and plans to achieve an annual production capacity of 244 GWh by 2030. However, only 13% of it belongs to low - risk projects, and the realization of most of the production capacity still depends on future policy directions.

In contrast, the development prospects of Poland and Hungary are clearer. The low - risk production capacities of the two countries reach 115 GWh and 125 GWh respectively. Although Poland has no plan to build new factories for the time being, Hungary is expected to add another 90 GWh of production capacity and may become a new center of the European electric vehicle industry in the future.

Major automobile economies such as France and Germany are in the middle position in the battery manufacturing field. The total production capacity of the two countries exceeds 350 GWh, of which 130 GWh belongs to low - risk projects.

Since last year, more and more European automobile manufacturers have slowed down the electrification process. The top priority for the EU is not only to re - examine its electrification strategy, find a balance between industrial policies, infrastructure, and market demand, but also to consider the input - output ratio of the original investment and how to calculate the sunk costs if the policy is slowed down or stopped.

This account is really hard to calculate because in addition to the huge investment of automobile enterprises, there are also huge ""money - burning"" pits in supporting facilities such as batteries. And behind it, there are millions of local jobs involved.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250714/v2_59ed0279110747298c576fc5f1a02324@000000@ai_oswg354499oswg1536oswg722_img_000~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:05:56.037730

In a recent explainer titled “EV Charging 101,” the automaker broke down the essentials of powering GM electric vehicles, reinforcing its commitment to making EV ownership practical, intuitive, and future-ready.

With the transition from the widely used CCS (Combined Charging System) to the NACS (North American Charging Standard) beginning in 2025, GM aims to unify charging standards across the industry. Cadillac’s upcoming 2026 OPTIQ and OPTIQ-V models will be the first GM vehicles equipped with native NACS ports, allowing direct access to Tesla Superchargers without adapters.

Home Charging Made Easy

For everyday use, GM promotes home charging as the most convenient and cost-effective method. Two levels are supported:

Level 1 (120-volt): A standard outlet offering 3–5 miles of range per hour—ideal for short commutes.

Level 2 (240-volt): Significantly faster, providing up to 40 miles of range per hour.

GM Energy’s PowerUp 2 and PowerShift chargers allow overnight charging and even vehicle-to-home (V2H) energy backup during power outages, especially when paired with the V2H Enablement Kit. Preferred installation partners like Qmerit ensure a smooth setup process.

Public Charging Across North America

With access to over 250,000 charging stations through partnerships with EVgo, ChargePoint, and Pilot/Flying J—and now more than 21,500 Tesla Superchargers via GM-approved NACS adapters—GM EV owners can confidently travel long distances. The upcoming IONNA Rechargery network, a joint venture with other automakers, is expected to further expand fast-charging availability along key highways.

New GM EVs come equipped with Google Maps and built-in route planning to locate and filter nearby chargers, including availability and speed. The GM brand apps further simplify public charging by linking with provider networks and supporting Plug and Charge—a technology that allows automatic payment and authentication just by plugging in.

Charging Etiquette and Performance Tips

The guide also highlights proper charging behavior: vacating spots after an 80% charge, avoiding unnecessary use of shared power stations, and never unplugging other vehicles. Charging speeds may vary due to battery temperature, usage history, and other conditions, but pre-conditioning and charging to 80% are advised for daily use.

According to the ICCT, regular hybrids produce about 20 percent fewer emissions than petrol cars.
More Buyers Are Choosing Electric Electric vehicles are not just cleaner.","Electric cars are becoming a powerful solution to climate change. A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) has found that battery electric vehicles (EVs) now create 73 percent less pollution over their lifetime compared to petrol cars. This is a major improvement and shows just how fast clean technology is moving.

A Huge Drop in Emissions

The ICCT study shows that modern electric cars produce only 63 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre over their full life. This includes everything from building the car to driving it and scrapping it. Petrol cars, in comparison, release about 235 grams for every kilometre.

This shows how much cleaner EVs have become. In fact, the 73 percent reduction is 24 percent better than similar results from four years ago.

As Dr. Marta Negri, the lead researcher, explains, ""Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids.""

Battery Manufacturing: Less of a Problem Now

People often say electric vehicles pollute more when they are built because of the battery. It’s true that battery-making creates more emissions at the start. In fact, 40 to 60 percent of an EV’s production emissions come from the battery.

But this extra pollution is made up quickly once the EV is on the road. The study found that an electric car becomes cleaner than a petrol car after just 17,000 kilometres. That’s about one to two years of regular use. As battery factories improve and power grids become cleaner, this gap is closing even faster.

Cleaner Electricity Means Cleaner EVs

Electric vehicles do even better when they are charged with clean power like wind or solar energy. In that case, the total emissions drop by 78 percent compared to petrol cars, going down to just 52 grams of CO2 per kilometre.

This also proves that where your electricity comes from really matters. Even in areas where power comes from coal or gas, EVs still perform better because electric motors are much more efficient. While petrol engines convert only 16 to 25 percent of fuel into motion, electric motors convert up to 91 percent of electricity into movement.

Hybrids Lag Behind

Some people think hybrid cars are a good middle ground. But the numbers tell a different story. According to the ICCT, regular hybrids produce about 20 percent fewer emissions than petrol cars. Plug-in hybrids do slightly better, reducing emissions by 30 percent. Still, this is far behind the 73 percent cut achieved by full electric vehicles.

This makes one thing clear. While hybrids help a little, going fully electric makes the biggest difference for the environment.

More Buyers Are Choosing Electric

Electric vehicles are not just cleaner. They are also becoming more popular. In 2024, EV sales reached over 17 million units worldwide, growing by 25 percent from the previous year. This rise is being driven by better batteries, more charging points, and rising awareness of climate change.

Transport is one of the hardest sectors to make greener. But this new research proves that EVs are not just moving pollution somewhere else. They are actually cutting it down in a real and measurable way.

A Cleaner Future Is in Motion

The 73 percent drop in emissions is only the beginning. As battery technology improves and more power comes from renewable sources, electric vehicles will become even cleaner.

For people thinking about their next car, the answer is becoming clearer. EVs are not just cleaner on the road. They are cleaner throughout their whole life, from the factory to the driveway.

This shift is more than just a change in vehicles. It is a sign that the world is moving toward a better, cleaner way to travel. As more countries support electric cars and cut back on petrol and diesel, this study shows a real way forward. Electric vehicles are leading the way into a cleaner future for all.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/electric_cars_72_cleaner_than_petrol_cars_featured_0b308f2b0e.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 00:02:45.001212

Citing BPA’s own analysis demonstrating increased costs for consumers, along with the potential to weaken energy grid reliability and access to clean energy, the groups say the plan violates BPA’s obligations to consumers and the environment, according to a release.

“Energy prices have already skyrocketed across the Northwest over the past few years. People are struggling,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, in a statement. “BPA benefits immensely from the power generated in our region, but its responsibilities to Northwest utility customers rise above what works best for BPA. It must ensure the people in our region aren’t financially harmed by this hasty decision.”

BPA announced in May that it would join Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+ day-ahead market rather than continue in the “real time” market under the California Independent System Operator.

Agency officials said the move will yield economic benefits for its customers and more equitable management of the region’s energy resources.

The groups have petitioned the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to review BPA’s decision. Along with Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, the other parties include NW Energy Coalition, Idaho Conservation League, Sierra Club and Montana Environmental Information Center. They are being represented by environmental law firm Earthjustice.

“Bonneville’s decision on markets will affect the transmission and generation of electric power across the West and is exactly the type of major federal action that should first consider the harms it could cause to our air quality, grid system reliability, fish and wildlife, etc. This is exactly why Congress enacted NEPA – to examine the consequences before acting. Here, however, the agency has completely ignored its obligations under federal law,” said Jaimini Parekh, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, in a statement.

Officials with power utilities in the Tri-Cities region have said they have no concerns the move will pull power from the Tri-Cities; BPA is legally required to provide power to the 140 consumer-owned utilities in the region, which includes Benton REA, Benton PUD and Franklin PUD.

Those same officials have praised BPA’s decision, anticipating a greater likelihood of cost benefits since BPA would no longer have to adjust its operations in a way that would more likely benefit California ratepayers over the others it serves.

“It’s that element of governance, this will move to a collective conglomerate,” Ryan Redmond, CEO of Benton REA, previously told the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business. “It’s a solid and more equitable model for us to work from.”",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/2025/02/19/Ice-Harbor-Lock-and-Dam.jpg?height=635&t=1740001491&width=1200,N,,2025-07-13 23:04:11.457948

The article The GOP Megabill: What Taxpayers Should Know originally appeared on NerdWallet.","The sprawling budget bill signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on July 4 after it squeaked through Congress has many far-reaching effects for consumers, as well as for the economy at large. Taxes top the list.

The almost 900-page “big, beautiful bill” has plenty to say about taxes, and an array of changes, new credits and deductions are part of the new bill. But at its heart, the bill is about extending the tax provisions passed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, during Trump’s first administration.

Many 2017 tax cuts now permanent

“You know, everyone's focused on changing this and changing that, but the main point of this law was to extend or make permanent a lot of the provisions that were in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” says Evan Morgan, a CPA and principal in tax advisory services at Kaufman Rossin, a Miami-based accounting firm.

The clock was ticking on many of the 2017 changes, which were set to revert to earlier levels at the end of 2025.

“They were due to expire and go back to a higher rate,” Morgan says. “They said, ‘No, no, we’re going to make that permanent.’”

Tax brackets

In tax year 2017, tax rates ranged from 10% to 39.6%. The TJCA lowered the top rate, for top earners, to 37%. That range is now made permanent in the “big, beautiful bill,” which also makes provisions to adjust certain income thresholds — or brackets — for inflation in future years.

Standard deduction

Increases in the standard deduction enacted in 2017 were also due to expire, and the new bill not only makes them permanent, but raises them again and makes them active in tax year 2025 (for taxes filed in 2026).

The new standard deduction levels are:

Single filers and married filing separately: Increases from $15,000 to $15,750.

Married filing jointly: Increases from $30,000 to $31,500.

Heads of household: Increases from $22,500 to $23,625.

In tax year 2017, before the TCJA, standard deductions were $6,350 for individuals, $12,700 for those married filing jointly and $9,350 for heads of household.

State and local tax deduction

Before the TJCA, there was no cap on the amount a taxpayer could deduct for certain state and local taxes paid. The 2017 act set a $10,000 cap, set to expire at the end of 2025 — and then revert to no cap.

The new bill sets a new cap at $40,000 in tax year 2025, rising 1% to $40,400 in 2026. In tax year 2029, it reverts to $10,000.

The state and local (SALT) deduction is available only for taxpayers who itemize rather than take the standard deduction, and there are limitations for high earners. Still, it can be worth exploring, particularly for homeowners.

“Even in a non-tax state like Florida, it doesn't take that expensive of a home to get you to $10,000 in property taxes,” says Morgan. “Now that limit has been raised from 10 to 40.”

Child tax credit

In 2017, the TCJA temporarily raised the maximum child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. The credit was due to revert to $1,000 at the end of this year. The legislation raises the maximum credit to $2,200 for the current year, adjusts it for inflation going forward, and makes it permanent.

What’s new in the ‘big, beautiful bill’?

Senior deduction

During his campaign, Trump pledged to eliminate income taxes some Americans over 65 pay on their Social Security benefits. Instead, the bill adds a new deduction for qualifying taxpayers:

$6,000 for eligible individuals.

$12,000 for married couples filing jointly if both spouses are 65 or older.

The deduction is temporary, ending after tax year 2028, and is layered on top of the standard deduction available to all taxpayers and the additional senior standard deduction. To get the full deduction, eligible taxpayers must have $75,000 or less in modified adjusted gross income ($150,000 or less for joint filers).

No taxes on tips/overtime

Trump also campaigned on ending taxes on tips and overtime, and the new legislation enacts both pledges — temporarily. Unless Congress takes further action, these provisions will expire after tax year 2028. Both take effect this tax year (for taxes filed in 2026).

On tips:

Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct up to $25,000 in “qualified” tips from their income.

Tipped workers will still be on the hook for payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare.

There are limitations on industries included, as well as a gradual phaseout of the deduction above certain modified adjusted gross income thresholds ($150,000 for individuals; $300,000 for couples).

On overtime:

Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct up to $12,500 against their overtime pay. This doubles to $25,000 for qualified joint filers.

The deduction applies to any amount paid over the worker’s base pay.

The deduction is reduced after the same thresholds as the tips provision.

Deduction for car loan interest

This deduction is designed to boost U.S. auto manufacturing, so there are built-in limits on qualifying. This deduction is available starting in tax year 2025 (taxes filed in 2026) and expires after tax year 2028.

The basics:

Taxpayers can write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans.

Taxpayers don’t have to itemize to claim the deduction.

The restrictions:

The car must be new and purchased after Dec. 31, 2024.

The car must be assembled in the United States.

The deduction is reduced — potentially down to $0 — for individuals earning more than $100,000 per year (or joint filers earning more than $200,000).

Tax breaks for small businesses

There are numerous tax provisions in the bill that affect businesses of all sizes, including small businesses.

“The two biggest ones that we're going to deal with is the restoration of bonus depreciation and the enhancement of Section 179 expense for businesses that buy fixed assets,” says Morgan, who specializes in working with small businesses.

Changes to the bonus depreciation will allow businesses to deduct 100% of the cost of new “qualified property” (certain kinds of machinery and other “short-lived” assets) acquired after Jan. 19, 2025.

The TCJA set a 100% deduction back in 2017, but it began phasing out in 2022. Before the latest changes, the deduction would have been 40% in the current tax year.

“So in other words, if I spent a million dollars on things like computers and desks and chairs and furniture and fixtures, as a business, I was only going to get a 40% bonus appreciation deduction in 2025,” says Morgan. “That has now been changed retroactively … and it's gone back to 100%. So that's going to be pretty big.”

Section 179 allows businesses to deduct the cost of certain assets at full value, rather than a depreciated cost. The “big, beautiful bill” raises the limit for this kind of deduction from $1 million to $2.5 million.

There are many more changes that have impacts for business owners, and there are nuances to the two changes listed above. For details, business owners should consult with a tax advisor.

Good news for online sellers

Morgan did highlight one additional change that will be of interest to those who sell items online through platforms like Etsy, Venmo and eBay.

The threshold for reporting sales was reduced to $600 annually in the American Rescue Plan of 2021, though implementation of the new limit had been delayed.

The new budget bill reinstates the previous reporting limits of $20,000 and 200 transactions.

What’s going away?

While the “big, beautiful bill” is almost entirely focused on cutting taxes, some tax credits are going away — primarily in the realm of clean energy.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing a new electric vehicle and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing used EVs, will both end on Sept. 30, 2025.

Two clean energy tax credits, which together allow homeowners to claim a tax credit for rooftop solar, geothermal heat pumps or other green energy devices, will end after 2025.

A lot of changes — with a smaller IRS

Many new tax changes will require the IRS to develop new internal rules and guidelines — at a time when the agency is rapidly losing staff and funding. As part of the new administration’s push to trim the federal workforce, the IRS workforce has already decreased by more than 25% and further cuts are planned.

Now it’s prepared to usher in a second one, when the country’s leaders in innovation, technology, energy and artificial intelligence meet at Carnegie Mellon University on Tuesday for the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit.
Drake’s Well, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, ushered in an energy revolution.
“People will quickly see we are on the brink of America’s next industrial revolution, just in the same way Pennsylvania led the first one when Drake’s oil was discovered,” McCormick said.
His answer: “The energy production is incredible, it is the number two energy producer in the country which is the first necessary step to power the AI revolution and to really power the energy revolution.","PITTSBURGH — It was the site of America’s first industrial revolution. Now it’s prepared to usher in a second one, when the country’s leaders in innovation, technology, energy and artificial intelligence meet at Carnegie Mellon University on Tuesday for the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit.

President Donald Trump, in an interview with me ahead of the summit, said the event is going to “open the eyes of a lot of people of what is about to be unleashed in Pennsylvania.”

Senator David McCormick, the Pittsburgh Republican who assembled the July 15 event, said the energy and AI summit will feature Trump, several cabinet members, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, big Tech leaders from OpenAI and Meta as well as energy leaders from all over the country, including the natural gas powerhouse EQT’s Toby Rice.

“And what is about to happen here in Pennsylvania, with the technology experts from our universities, the natural resources, the ability to turn around long dormant industrial communities and our unparrelled workforce is a game changer,” McCormick said.

He compares the moment to 1859, when Edwin Drake became the first American to successfully drill for oil. Drake’s Well, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, ushered in an energy revolution.

Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie was an early investor in this oil boom, which he then used to build the largest steel company in the world in western Pennsylvania. Carnegie became one of the richest men in American history, and donated most of it — including to the Pittsburgh research university that bears his name.

“People will quickly see we are on the brink of America’s next industrial revolution, just in the same way Pennsylvania led the first one when Drake’s oil was discovered,” McCormick said.

“We are at that moment right now, thanks to the technology that comes from [Carnegie Mellon] and the hubs of companies that surround it, as well as our incredible work force to build these AI data power centers, and the tradesmen and women who will supply the energy needed for them,” he said.

Darrin Kelly, the President of the Allegheny-Fayette Labor Council, said if the investments in projects all line up, his men and women will be ready to go. “We have the best workforce in the world and no matter what it is, we’ll shine when the time comes.”

The event comes on the heels of a boom in the labor force in Pennsylvania that kicked off last month when Trump announced the partnership and $11 billion investment from Japanese-owned Nippon Steel. That investment not only kept the American steelmaker in the U.S., but also protected more than 100,000 jobs through investments in steelmaking in Pennsylvania as well as in other plants in Indiana, Arkansas, Minnesota and Alabama.

That announcement was quickly followed by Amazon pledging $20 billion in Pennsylvania for AI infrastructure.

Shapiro told me that the investment will establish multiple high tech cloud computing and AI innovation campuses across the Commonwealth, “It will create thousands of new jobs that will build, operate and maintain the first two data center campuses in Luzerne and Bucks counties,” he said, adding, “look for more investment soon.”

Western Pennsylvania sits in the sweet spot for the growth and development of the AI boom; both the University of Pittsburgh and CMU are heralded for attracting and training some of the brightest minds in the country when it comes to engineering, research and artificial intelligence.

Western Pennsylvania has had its troubles. After the end of the steel boom, the area decayed, unemployment was rampant — still-vacant coal fired power plants, steel mills and manufacturing plants stand as ghostly sentinels of an era that has long vanished.

But things started to turn around about 15 years with a natural-gas boom and oil fracking technology. McCormick says between the access to massive amounts of energy, both natural gas, nuclear as well as coal that will turn things around in a way no one has seen for generations.

In April, in Homer City, the stacks of a former coal fired power plant were imploded, and the site is being redeveloped into a $10 billion AI and data center.

In the two years since the Homer City coal fire plant had been closed down, the tiny western Pennsylvania village had already started to show signs of depression — but the new investment changed everything.

McCormick said this isn’t just about the potential tens of thousands of construction jobs to build these AI data centers. “These jobs will also include chemists, scientists, engineers, AI experts, physicists,” he said.

McCormick said people have asked him why Pittsburgh?

His answer: “The energy production is incredible, it is the number two energy producer in the country which is the first necessary step to power the AI revolution and to really power the energy revolution. We have incredible skilled labor, with the welders, steam fitters, pipe fitters, construction workers and electricians, but we also have incredibly sophisticated technologists.”

“I think it’s arguably CMU is the best AI university in the country. It’s got incredible tradition with computer science and technologists, which is why in recent years, Google and Apple and Airbnb and everybody else, Tesla all have offices around here because they’re trying to draw on that talent,” he said.

Trump, Shapiro and McCormick all expressed great excitement about what people learn from this summit, but also to show the turn around for the region.

“Too often the stories have been about what once was, well this is a moment about how great things will be,” said McCormick, adding, “We are only beginning.”

In addition, the property owners have not sufficiently alleged the expected impact of the concrete batch plant on their own properties.
Instead, they have merely relied on news reports and other information describing the consequences of other concrete batch plants elsewhere.
Lockaby, Botetourt County Attorney (Spilman Thomas & Battle, PLLC, on brief), for appellee Botetourt County Board of Supervisors.","Where the appellants did not own or occupy real property in close proximity to the challenged location, and failed to demonstrate a particularized harm, they lacked standing to challenge the zoning determination.

Background

This matter is part of an ongoing series of lawsuits concerning an onshore wind project known as the Rocky Forge Wind Farm in Botetourt County, Virginia. Appellants appeal from the judgment of the circuit court finding that they lacked standing in the circuit court to challenge the decision of the Botetourt County Board of Zoning Appeals affirming the determination made by the Botetourt County Zoning Administrator.

Standard

First, the complainant must own or occupy real property within or in close proximity to the property that is the subject of the land use determination, thus establishing that it has a direct, immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest in the decision. Second, the complainant must allege facts demonstrating a particularized harm to some personal or property right, legal or equitable, or imposition of a burden or obligation upon the petitioner different from that suffered by the public generally.

Melissa Hunley

The court first considers whether Melissa Hunley, the closest of the property owners, had standing in the circuit court. Her property is approximately two miles from the concrete batch plant. Given that the concrete batch plant in this case is not dissimilar from the construction sites at issue in other Supreme Court cases assessing standing to challenge zoning decisions, and given that Hundley is located significantly farther from the concrete batch plant than successful litigants in Supreme Court cases where the court has found that there was standing, the court finds that Melissa Hundley has failed to satisfy the first prong of the standing test.

Moreover Hundley has not shown that the construction and operations of the concrete batch plant create a “particularized harm” to her or to her property that is “different from that suffered by the public generally.” While Hundley alleges that runoff from the concrete batch plant could damage her streams, the record before this court on appeal shows that her property is actually upstream from the concrete batch plant, so the streams on her property would not be harmed by any purported runoff that runs into Mill Creek.

Furthermore, it is not enough for Hundley to claim that dust and noise from the concrete batch plant will affect her. Hundley must instead allege that the dust and noise affect her in a way distinguishable from those around her—the general public—and that the concrete batch plant creates “sufficient noise, particulate matter, or pollution off site to cause actual harm.”

Remaining property owners

The remaining property owners each alleged in their petition that the dust, noise or runoff from the concrete batch plant would negatively impact their enjoyment of the natural resources on their own land and in the surrounding area. These property owners, however, have not alleged why the special environmental protections included in the modified permit that Rocky Forge Wind obtained from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality would not protect them from the alleged dust, noise and runoff from the concrete batch plant.

In addition, the property owners have not sufficiently alleged the expected impact of the concrete batch plant on their own properties. Instead, they have merely relied on news reports and other information describing the consequences of other concrete batch plants elsewhere.

The additional concerns alleged by the property owners that a potential “spill of concrete, fuel, cement, etc., could be devastating” to “the property owners abutting Mill Creek” likewise fails to satisfy the particularized harm standard for standing because none of the property owners (other than Hundley who, as noted lives upstream from the concrete batch plant) claim to own land actually abutting Mill Creek or the Rocky Forge Wind Farm site.

This committee makes recommendations for council consideration. Majority council approval would be required at a future council meeting for any resolutions to take effect.

The first resolution focuses on the proposed construction of a plastics plant by Alterra Energy LLC in Sugarloaf Township.

According to the proposed resolution, the Akron, Ohio-based company has proposed to construct a plastics pyrolysis plant at 42 Tomhicken Road that would involve transporting approximately 100,000 tons of discarded plastic into the county from major urban centers, such as New York City and Philadelphia.

It said the “proposed plant would reportedly produce approximately 80,000 tons per year of a fuel product derived from the pyrolysis of plastic waste.”

The resolution cites concerns about the emission of toxic chemicals and pollutants and would urge the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and any other relevant regulatory agencies to deny permits or other approvals for the proposed facility.

The second resolution would oppose new PPL transmission lines through Nescopeck, Black Creek, Sugarloaf and Hazle townships. PPL said that project will provide additional power and support existing and future load growth.

“Numerous residents, property owners and community organizations have expressed deep concerns regarding potential negative impacts on property values, community aesthetics, the environment and public health,” the proposed resolution said.

The resolution would urge PPL and regulatory agencies to pursue alternative routes or solutions and perform environmental and health impact assessments.

Tuesday’s committee meeting is at 6 p.m. in the county courthouse on River Street in Wilkes-Barre.

Instructions to attend remotely will be posted under council’s online meetings section at luzernecounty.org.

Councilman Jimmy Sabatino chairs the infrastructure committee, and Harry Haas is vice chair. The other members are Patty Krushnowski and LeeAnn McDermott.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, accused Republicans on Friday of wanting to ""bury their constituents"" after the deadly Texas floods by rolling back ways to combat climate change.

She specifically called out the Trump administration and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem for what she claimed was a delayed response to the flash flooding that devastated parts of central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend.

She went on to blame the Republican Party for voting on the ""big, ugly bill"" to effectively begin ""clawing back"" on ways to help combat climate change and prevent similar disasters.

""The reality is that we are going to continue to face emergencies, especially since as we just got done with the big, ugly bill, they are clawing back those things that would have hopefully started to cool this planet down, because they don’t believe in science,"" Crockett said on MSNBC’s ""The Weeknight."" ""The least that they could do is believe in helping American people. Unfortunately, we continue to see Republicans decide that they want to bury their constituents instead of actually doing everything that they can to make sure that they live amazing and full lives.""

More than 120 people were killed in the flash flooding with dozens reported missing.

Since last week, several Democratic figures have been quick to politicize the floods by blaming climate change and President Donald Trump’s government cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) for exacerbating the damage.

In a statement to Fox News Digital last week, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it ""shameful and disgusting"" to see Democrats politicizing the tragedy and insisted accusations that the NWS was understaffed had been ""debunked by meteorologists, experts, and other public reporting.""

Last month, Crockett also agreed with a statement from CNN analyst Michael Fanone that ""Republicans want poor people to die as quickly as humanly possible.""

US motorists who fancy switching from their old gas-powered vehicle to a new electric vehicle can claim up to $7,500 thanks to the Clean Vehicle Credits.

Anyone buying a used EV could save up to $4,000.

However, all of that is set to change after September 30.

$7,500 tax credit set to run out soon

While EVs are generally cheaper to run than their gas-powered counterparts, they tend to come with a higher upfront cost.

In the US, in a bid to get more folks to make the switch, the United States introduced an attractive tax credit of $7,500 for new US-made electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs.

However, the tax credit is set to be scrapped after the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill by President Donald Trump.

All federal EV tax incentives will end after September 30, 2025.

The bill was passed by Congress on July 3, and means all federal tax incentives will end on September 30.

As a result, car experts are sending out a clear message to US motorists who are considering getting an electric vehicle.

“Now is the time to buy,” director of industry insights at Cox Automotive Stephanie Valdez Streaty told CNBC.

She also suggested that we might see dealers offering better savings to create a sense of urgency with the $7,500 tax credit set to run out.

Things to watch out for if you’re buying a new EV

With the $7,500 tax credit set to run out in just three months, some experts have predicted a surge in new EV purchases.

But there are some things to look out for, the tax credit only applies to new vehicles, trucks, vans, and SUVs priced under $80,000 for trucks, and under $55,000 for all other cars.

If you’re hoping to get a used car to claim up to $4,000 in tax credit, it will need to be at least two years old and cost $25,000 or under.

The vehicle itself also needs to meet some requirements, including having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and undergoing final assembly in North America.

Greylock has grown the company by expanding in multiple directions: acquisitions, the drill bit and diversification.
We’ve increased production without drilling any new wells—just being able to get a lot of wells back online and working over wells.
“We’re starting to see a lot of traction and get deals done with what we call ‘demand-driven’ projects.
“That’s really unchanged.” Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said.","You need to be scrappy to survive as a private producer on the small side of the spectrum. But if you can keep that grit, hold the line on cost and set a sharp eye on the competition, you can spot the opportunities.

“That’s the fun part, but it’s certainly a challenge,” Greylock Energy CEO Kyle Mork told Hart Energy.

Greylock has grown the company by expanding in multiple directions: acquisitions, the drill bit and diversification.

Much of its leadership team worked together originally at Energy Corp. of America. In 2017, the Greylock team coalesced with backing from Boston-based private equity firm Arclight Capital and some 3,500 conventional wells in Appalachia, which the company still operates.

The next step was taking a position in Greene County, Pennsylvania, with unconventional acreage in the dry gas Marcellus play, and also some midstream assets.

“In the first several years of Greylock, we were really about growing via the drill bit in the Marcellus position in Greene County,” Mork said.

“The entire time we’ve existed, we’ve looked at opportunities to acquire new assets. Initially, we were primarily focused on other Appalachian assets and then as time went on, we started looking at other basins. In 2022, we closed a big deal to buy assets in the Rockies in both Utah and Wyoming from a public producer.”

That deal allowed Greylock “to really take an asset that was very non-core for the seller and [create] very much a core asset for us. We’ve increased production without drilling any new wells—just being able to get a lot of wells back online and working over wells.

“We’ve continued to develop, drill new wells and bring wells online in the east and are preparing for our first new activity in the Rockies in the next 12 months or so.”

Standing out

On a production basis, Greylock’s footprint is two-thirds in Appalachia and one-third in the Rockies. But two key aspects set it apart, Mork said.

Augmenting its upstream production is Greylock’s midstream business, which builds out projects for third parties.

“We’re starting to see a lot of traction and get deals done with what we call ‘demand-driven’ projects. For instance, we have two projects with a big steel producer here in Appalachia that consumes a good amount of gas as a part of the process, so we built pipelines for them. And we’re talking to data centers, like everyone else on Earth, and other big consumers of gas on the midstream side,” Mork said.

Next is the technical team in place that packs a one-two punch of expertise: the firm can develop, drill, complete and bring online new unconventional resources in multiple places, as well as workover conventional assets and optimize them.

“We’re comfortable with both operating and producing fairly complex producing assets and also doing the latest and greatest unconventional development,” he said.

Expanding development

Greylock is always looking for its next add-on, Mork said. In any given year, the firm is examining different packages and bidding on assets.

“As we think about the next 12 to 24 months, I think we will be looking to expand development in our Utica play, potentially a little more in the Marcellus and then definitely, get our first development activity going in the Rockies, but we will also be looking for outside opportunities.

“We’re pretty basin agnostic. We want to look at everything that comes to market in Appalachia and in the Western Rockies as well, but we’re open to other basins and we’ve looked at assets in a lot of other basins as well.”

The firm’s entrance into the Rockies wasn’t necessarily premeditated, he said.

“We just really liked the asset as we started to look at it and thought there were some unique things about being in that basin with their gas pricing, and we picked up some liquids with it.

“But yes, we will definitely be looking at potential acquisitions this year.”

Rocking the resource

Greylock is a gas-weighted producer, a position that is coming into its own this year as Henry Hub prices have shown stability while crude oil is rocked by market volatility, tariffs and trade turmoil. A drop in Henry Hub prices below $3/MMBtu—or a pop above $5, for that matter—might trigger a reconsideration of activity levels. As such, the firm hasn’t needed to revisit its guidance, a step many of its peers took during the first quarter.

“Our real focus in the second half of the year is our next batch of wells in our Utica position in northern Pennsylvania,” Mork said. “That’s really unchanged.”

Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said. But drilling deep, 10,000-plus ft laterals in the Utica is an expensive proposition that also promises significant volume. Year-over-year production growth by the end of 2025 could be as much as 15%, he said. Production growth is in a 10% to 15% year-over-year range.

“For us, turning in three, four, five wells a year, we can achieve steady growth with respect to new wells and total company production,” he said. “Like a lot of producers now, we’re not looking to grow dramatically and outspend cash flow to do so. We’re really looking to grow at a steady pace and be able to do it within our existing cashflow.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/07/drilling-site-2.jpg?itok=SpmD7yAS,N,,2025-07-13 21:04:08.911721

Next is the technical team in place that packs a one-two punch of expertise: the firm can develop, drill, complete and bring online new unconventional resources in multiple places, as well as workover conventional assets and optimize them.

“We’re comfortable with both operating and producing fairly complex producing assets and also doing the latest and greatest unconventional development,” he said.

Expanding development

Greylock is always looking for its next add-on, Mork said. In any given year, the firm is examining different packages and bidding on assets.

“As we think about the next 12 to 24 months, I think we will be looking to expand development in our Utica play, potentially a little more in the Marcellus and then definitely, get our first development activity going in the Rockies, but we will also be looking for outside opportunities.

“We’re pretty basin agnostic. We want to look at everything that comes to market in Appalachia and in the Western Rockies as well, but we’re open to other basins and we’ve looked at assets in a lot of other basins as well.”

The firm’s entrance into the Rockies wasn’t necessarily premeditated, he said.

“We just really liked the asset as we started to look at it and thought there were some unique things about being in that basin with their gas pricing, and we picked up some liquids with it.

“But yes, we will definitely be looking at potential acquisitions this year.”

Rocking the resource

Greylock is a gas-weighted producer, a position that is coming into its own this year as Henry Hub prices have shown stability while crude oil is rocked by market volatility, tariffs and trade turmoil. A drop in Henry Hub prices below $3/MMBtu—or a pop above $5, for that matter—might trigger a reconsideration of activity levels. As such, the firm hasn’t needed to revisit its guidance, a step many of its peers took during the first quarter.

“Our real focus in the second half of the year is our next batch of wells in our Utica position in northern Pennsylvania,” Mork said. “That’s really unchanged.”

Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said. But drilling deep, 10,000-plus ft laterals in the Utica is an expensive proposition that also promises significant volume. Year-over-year production growth by the end of 2025 could be as much as 15%, he said. Production growth is in a 10% to 15% year-over-year range.

“For us, turning in three, four, five wells a year, we can achieve steady growth with respect to new wells and total company production,” he said. “Like a lot of producers now, we’re not looking to grow dramatically and outspend cash flow to do so. We’re really looking to grow at a steady pace and be able to do it within our existing cashflow.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/07/drilling-site-2.jpg?itok=SpmD7yAS,N,,2025-07-14 05:10:43.835168

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 20:09:54.123788

Since the oil crises of the 1970s, many more countries have installed policies and emergency response measures that can buffer the impacts of potential supply disruptions, while also taking steps to diversify their energy mixes and improve energy efficiency. At the same time, the world’s energy system has grown increasingly complex and interconnected – calling for an expanded set of policy tools and updated approach to emergency preparedness, as discussed at the Summit on the Future of Energy Security in April 2025.

The IEA’s Global Energy Policies Hub, first released in October 2024 and reviewed annually by IEA Members, provides a snapshot of the current state of energy policies around the world. Its latest update, published this week, features over 5 000 records for over 84 countries that collectively represent about 90% of global energy demand. This presents an opportunity to explore how the world has progressed since the IEA was founded in 1974, and to assess whether it is in a better place to withstand shocks to energy supply chains. It also allows for an assessment of the new policies countries are adopting to manage emerging risks – from cyber threats to climate resilience and the security of clean energy supply chains.

Virtually all oil importers are now buffered by oil security measures advocated by the IEA

Over the past 50 years, significant strides have been made in implementing key emergency response measures to respond to oil supply disruptions. Prior to the first oil crisis in 1973, only a small number of countries – representing fewer than 1% of net oil imports – had emergency measures in place (such as Morocco’s 1971 Law on Security Stocks). The International Energy Programme, the IEA’s founding document, introduced a binding requirement in 1974 for Member countries to maintain oil reserves equivalent to 90 days of net imports, alongside measures to restrain demand and promote greater energy efficiency, diversification and innovation. As a result, by 1975, the coverage of emergency reserves and demand-restraint policies expanded to about 10 countries representing about 35% of global net imports.

Additional policies were implemented in response to the oil market shocks prompted by the Gulf War in 1991, the Libyan Civil War in 2011, and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Since 1991, 40 additional countries have adopted oil stockholding requirements and measures to help restrain demand in case of an emergency. Now, countries with at least one or more oil security measure cover 98% of net oil imports, with emergency oil stock requirements present in 61 countries (42 of which are net importers).

Natural gas security measures have proliferated over the past decade

Historically, natural gas security measures have been less common. However, the past 10 years have prompted a strong uptick in adoption – specifically in terms of stockholding requirements, which grew from covering only 11% of net gas imports in 2015 to 32% in 2025. Thirteen countries enacted or enhanced stockholding policies following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Notably, the European Union (EU) implemented gas stockpiling requirements – which set obligations for member states to fill storage facilities to at least 90% of their capacity by November each year – and Japan established a Strategic Buffer LNG (SBL) framework, with LNG cargoes readily available in case of supply emergencies. However, gas stockpiling remains limited outside of IEA Member countries; only Chinese Taipei, Thailand, South Africa and Ukraine have mandates for strategic gas stocks. This leaves around 98% of natural gas demand in emerging and developing economies uncovered by stockpiling requirements.

Demand-restraint measures for gas have become increasingly common since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well. Over 40 countries that are net importers of gas now have legislation in place to implement such measures, with 25 introducing them within the past 10 years, including most EU and Balkan countries. These measures again remain limited in emerging and developing economies, with only 12 countries – including Bangladesh, India and Pakistan – incorporating explicit demand-side measures into legislation.

Efforts to diversify energy supplies and improve efficiency have become fixtures in energy security policy

Beyond emergency measures, governments have also pursued longer-term policy efforts since the 1970s to reduce their exposure to disruptions in energy supply, largely via measures to improve energy efficiency and diversify their energy mixes.

Based on the IEA’s tracking, energy efficiency policies are now in place in about 130 countries. The coverage and stringency of these policies continues to expand; more than 15% of global energy demand has been covered by new or upgraded energy efficiency regulations or incentives in the past four years. Recent policies include the 2024 EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, Australia’s first-ever federal fuel economy standard, updated carbon dioxide (CO2) standards in Mexico and stronger fuel efficiency standards in Saudi Arabia.

As a result of this expanding coverage and increased stringency, the energy efficiency of key equipment, vehicles and appliances sold has improved in all regions since 2010. Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for appliances are getting tougher globally, the IEA Efficiency Policy Level Index shows. Meanwhile, stricter fuel economy standards have contributed to a more than 20% reduction in the road transport sector’s energy intensity, complementing trends such as increasing electrification and the substitution of other fuels for oil.

Policies aimed at diversifying countries’ energy mixes have also been implemented at an accelerated rate over the past two decades, especially in the power sector. Today, more than three-quarters of global power sector demand is covered by policies aimed at diversifying power generation, relying on measures such as utility obligations, tax credits and other incentives.

In recent years, the largest focus has been placed on renewables and nuclear. Since 2010, around 20 new countries have adopted new policies aimed at expanding renewable energy capacity, bringing the total to over 100 countries as of last year.

These efforts have had an impact. According to the IEA’s Total Energy Supply Diversification Index, in 1973, nearly 70% of today’s 32 IEA Members had what is considered high fuel concentrations in their energy mixes. Today, none remain in this category, following an increase in the shares of natural gas, nuclear power and renewable energy sources to meet their energy needs.

The focus of energy security policies is now expanding to cover critical minerals, cybersecurity and climate resilience

As the global energy system evolves, the definition of energy security is expanding, with governments increasingly considering measures to address risks related to critical minerals, cybersecurity and climate hazards. Policies and measures focused on energy supply chain risks remain less mature, but new frameworks are being adopted in a growing number of countries.

The IEA’s Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2025 highlighted the pivotal role that policy mechanisms can play in diversifying mineral supplies. While public financing support can help bring forward new projects, additional policy tools are needed to reduce investment barriers and provide long-term market signals. In light of the growing number of trade restrictions on critical minerals, strengthening resilience to potential supply disruptions is increasingly important as well.

Though efforts such as the IEA’s Voluntary Critical Minerals Security Programme, the Agency is working with governments to enhance preparedness, promote supply diversification, and foster innovation and recycling. The Critical Minerals Policy Tracker monitors and analyses policy developments on critical minerals across more than 35 countries. With an initial dataset of 200 policies, it now identifies more than 600.

Another recent IEA report, Energy Technology Perspectives 2024, highlights how countries are increasingly pursuing industrial strategies aimed at reducing supply chain risks for clean energy technologies and boosting domestic manufacturing. The EU Net-Zero Industry Act and Japan GX Promotion Strategy, for example, are set to alter the outlook for the manufacturing and trade of key energy products such as electric vehicles and batteries. Still, IEA analysis shows that further efforts are needed globally to ensure the diversification of supply chains for key energy components so they are less vulnerable to shocks.

The cybersecurity of energy infrastructure has also been receiving greater attention in the wake of several notable attacks.

Cybersecurity requirements for energy infrastructure are now in place in 71 countries. However, the frequency and complexity of attacks continues to increase; the IEA special report Energy and AI found that in 2024, a typical energy utility was subject to over 1 500 attempted cyberattacks per week – triple the number only four years earlier. The pace at which cybersecurity attacks grow and evolve will require the constant adaptation of policy frameworks to best respond to new threats – along with the use of technological innovations, such as proactive AI-enabled cybersecurity systems, which could enable quick interventions and responses to attacks.

Natural disasters continue to be among the most routine disruptions to energy systems – and risks to the secure operation of energy infrastructure are becoming more acute as a result of climate change and the increasing complexity of energy systems themselves.

To address these challenges and reduce the fallout from major weather events, natural disaster funds – which insure households and some small and medium enterprises in the case of major capital losses – are now in place in 55 countries.

During the Future of Energy Security Summit, countries asked the IEA to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of natural hazards on the energy system today and how they might evolve going forward, while identifying the policies and measures that could help address these risks.

The results will be published in a forthcoming report, and future versions of the Global Energy Policies Hub will include an expanded assessment of policies in this category.",,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:27.077860

The Trump administration is defying these principles. President Trump is rolling back longstanding protections using unlawful shortcuts that shortchange the public’s right to provide input and understand how that feedback has shaped federal agency decisions.

Enacted soon after the end of World War II, the Administrative Procedure Act outlines steps that federal agencies must take when they issue or amend regulations, also known as rules. Critically, this process includes soliciting and then responding to significant comments from the public, especially when those rules affect people’s rights and responsibilities under federal law.

The Trump administration has jettisoned this established approach to rescind bedrock legal protections for everyday Americans in the dark of night, with almost no explanation.

President Trump signaled his plan to skirt established processes for rulemaking in a presidential memorandum issued on April 9, “Directing the Repeal of Unlawful Regulations.”

The memorandum accurately recognizes that a federal agency may use an expedited approach under the Administrative Procedure Act if it has “good cause” to find that the usual process would be “impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.”

Indeed, the Administrative Conference of the United States has recognized that expedited processes, such as direct final rules, are appropriate in some instances, such as when the proposed rule changes are noncontroversial. It further underscores the importance of public engagement whenever there is truly “good cause” to use an expedited approach.

However, the Trump administration is abusing this process by using expedited processes for changes that are clearly controversial.

For example, in May, the U.S. Department of Energy issued four direct final rules related to nondiscrimination protections in federally assisted programs or activities pertaining to general programs, new construction requirements, nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education and regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in sports.

This means that entities that receive federal funds from the Department of Energy will not have to provide interpretation and translation services when needed. They will not need to eliminate architectural barriers that make buildings inaccessible, nor will they be prohibited from engaging in activities that perpetuate the effects of discrimination.

These direct final rules are part of a broader rollback of longstanding civil rights protections under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws, which Trump previewed in his misguided and deceptively titled executive order on Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy.

The Department of Energy’s direct final rules on nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs or activities fail the laugh test under the Administrative Procedure Act. As a comment recently filed with the Department of Energy by more than 40 law professors explains, “The use of direct final rules in these contexts contravenes the clear language of the Administrative Procedure Act, ignores long-established procedures on notice and comment rulemaking, and undermines the role of public participation in government rulemaking.”

Reinforcing this point, another comment filed by nearly 30 civil rights, environmental justice and environmental organizations, together with supporting individuals, underscores how the administration’s approach “violates the procedural mandates of the Administrative Procedure Act and subverts nondiscrimination principles that benefit all Americans.”

In the end, the number of comments the Department of Energy received on its nondiscrimination direct final rules speaks volumes: 19,421 comments regarding nondiscrimination (general provisions), 20,711 comments regarding new construction requirements related to nondiscrimination, 9,293 comments regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education and 21,264 comments regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in sports.

So what’s the harm in allowing the Department of Energy and other federal agencies in the Trump administration to bypass established procedures? The harm is to all of us — the American public.

According to the Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act from 1947, the law seeks to ensure that federal agencies keep the public informed and engage them in rulemaking through uniform processes that are subject to judicial review. These goals remain as true today as they did nearly 80 years ago.

As the United States commemorates the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, we must remember our founding principles — that a government by the people and of the people must also be accountable to the people. We cannot let the Trump administration shortchange these goals.

This will make it virtually impossible for manufacturers in the US to compete with China in high-tech manufacturing.
The rejection of renewable energy and turning back to coal is pure ideology, a macho rejection of environmentalism and wokeism.
So, it's entirely appropriate that Anthony Albanese is meeting Xi again before he meets Trump for the first time.","A few days after Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill that ended most subsidies for renewable energy, among many other things, the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company, Nvidia Corporation, became the first to pass $US4 trillion ($6.08 trillion) in value.

And a few days after that, on Thursday, Bitcoin hit a new record high above $US117,000.

The data centres that operate both AI and cryptocurrency are already massively increasing electricity demand and investors are obviously expecting them to keep doing so — exponentially.

Meanwhile, the BRICS summit in Brazil last week — it stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa — went in the opposite direction to the United States on climate change, committing to ""intensify global efforts to contain global warming"".

China's renewable energy strategy is paying off

Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't make it to Brazil, but he chaired a meeting of China's Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs which issued a directive to crack down on overcapacity and ""disorderly competition"" in solar power.

Let's join the dots: America is pivoting back to fossil fuels and pulling out of renewable energy while the rest of the world continues to do the opposite, China is grappling with too much renewable energy while investors are bidding expectations to record highs for the new industries whose data centres are eating the world's electricity.

In his Independence Day address after signing the One Big Beautiful Bill, Trump said: ""I noticed something — with all the windmills that China sends us, where we waste our money because it's the most expensive energy, you know they make about 95 per cent of them, the wind turbines, I have never seen a wind farm in China! Why is that?""

That is a long way from being true: China is bristling with wind farms, and solar farms.

Mistake number two for Trump is the cost: wind and solar are now the cheapest form of energy in China, as well as in most other places, and onshore wind is by far the cheapest, less than half the cost of coal.

China's long-term strategy of dominating the manufacture of renewable energy and electric vehicles, as well as critical minerals, especially the rare earths needed in modern technology, is now paying off, big time.

'Real men burn stuff'

Meanwhile, in the US, Trump announced a 50 per cent tariff on imports of copper, which is one of the minerals needed for AI and renewable energy.

This will make it virtually impossible for manufacturers in the US to compete with China in high-tech manufacturing.

That was on top of letters Trump sent to dozens of national leaders last week telling them what the tariff is going to be on their exports to America.

Why would America embark on such a series of colossal, and obvious, acts of self-harm?

The rejection of renewable energy and turning back to coal is pure ideology, a macho rejection of environmentalism and wokeism. As Paul Krugman wrote the other day: ""Real men burn stuff and don't worry if the process is dirty.""

In his Independence Day speech, Trump declared: ""Coal is back. You can't use the word 'coal' unless you precede it by saying 'clean beautiful coal.'""

China is also building coal-fired power stations, but only because it has to; the idea of saying ""coal is back"" and calling it clean and beautiful at the same time as more than one hundred people were dying in a Texas flood is insane.

Trump's tariff lie

As for the tariffs, the world's economists and trade policy experts are mystified by America's trade wars, but I don't think that's what they are: tariffs are taxes that Trump can say are paid by foreign countries rather than by Americans.

The letters he sent last week all said: ""We will charge (insert country) a Tariff of only (insert number) on any and all … products sent into the United States.""

That's what he always says when he's talking about the tariffs — that he is ""charging"" that country, as if it's a kind of fee paid to the US government for the right to sell stuff to Americans, and that the US Treasury is making tons of money from them. It is, but not from the other countries.

He knows, of course, as does everyone else, that tariffs are a sales tax paid by the American buyers of the imported products or absorbed into the margins of the local companies importing them if they can't pass it on for some reason.

The US government is ""charging"" the Americans who buy Brazilian products a 50 per cent tax on what they buy, not Brazil, and will be putting a 50 per cent tax on copper, as well as taxes of at least 10 per cent on every import coming into the US.

It is a GST of at least 20 per cent on the $US4.1 trillion of goods imported into the US — 14 per cent of total goods sold.

Before the tariffs are fully in place, the US government is already making about $US30 billion in extra revenue and will theoretically increase to about $US500 billion.

Except that Trump keeps saying that American citizens aren't paying it — someone else is.

It is breathtaking, brilliant, political mendacity; the media, economists and his political opponents are getting tired of pointing it out, and he just keeps saying it, proving Joseph Goebbels's dictum that if you repeat a lie often enough it becomes true.

Xi now more important than Trump

The result of all this is that China — a ruthless autocracy — appears destined to take global leadership from the US, in trade, the means of producing energy and, possibly, in ""soft power"", or moral leadership, as the US withdraws from foreign aid and multilateralism.

The US dollar seems entrenched as the world's reserve currency and the basis of most finance and trade, but even that can't be taken for granted. It won't be replaced by Bitcoin, but a combination of the Euro and Chinese yuan is likely to eat into its market share.

But Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are not going away, and the data centre capacity they require will continue to add to the ballooning demand for computing power and electricity from AI.

And while the leader in AI chip design, and now the world's most valuable company — Nvidia — is American, its chips are made in Taiwan, just as Apple's iPhones are made in China.

The American technology companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon still reign supreme over the internet and AI era, but China is closing on them fast.

China is already in the process of obliterating the American and European car industries with solid, well-designed, cheaper vehicles and will almost certainly do the same with all other high-tech products, including robots.

So, it's entirely appropriate that Anthony Albanese is meeting Xi again before he meets Trump for the first time.

Xi is more important than Trump now.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/26703bf8ad4eb1c49c5a5df8a0499eb2?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2025&cropW=3600&xPos=0&yPos=188&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-07-13 20:09:32.981770

New York City's Green Rides Mandate, which requires all high-volume rideshare trips to use zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) or wheelchair-accessible vehicles by 2030, is a landmark policy with profound implications for ride-sharing giants like Uber and Lyft, EV infrastructure providers, and investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition.

The mandate's phased targets—starting at 5% ZEV compliance in 2024 and escalating by 10–20 percentage points annually—create a clear timeline for stakeholders. Yet the path to full electrification is fraught with financial, operational, and logistical challenges. For investors, this is both a cautionary tale and an opportunity to identify companies positioned to thrive—or falter—in this transition.

The Cost Burden on Drivers: A Critical Hurdle

While the mandate aims to “electrify without imposing new costs on drivers,” the reality is starkly different. Ride-sharing drivers—who often operate as independent contractors—bear the brunt of upfront EV costs, maintenance, and infrastructure gaps.

High EV Prices and Maintenance: Electric vehicles (EVs) cost $30,000–$130,000, far exceeding the price of comparable gas vehicles. Battery replacements, which can cost up to $10,000 after five years, add to the burden.

Lease Constraints: Many drivers are locked into long-term leases for gas vehicles, with no easy exit to switch to EVs.

Charging Inconveniences: With 80% of NYC drivers lacking home charging access, reliance on public stations is a necessity. Yet fast-charging infrastructure is sparse, and many existing chargers are Tesla-specific or slow Level 2 units.

These challenges could pressure Uber and Lyft to absorb costs or risk losing drivers—and market share—to competitors with better EV support.

Infrastructure Gaps: The Achilles' Heel of Electrification

Even if drivers could afford EVs, the charging network must expand exponentially. The city's goal to install 40,000 Level 2 and 6,000 fast chargers by 2030 is ambitious but faces hurdles:

Geographic Inequity: Manhattan dominates charger availability, while Queens and the Bronx lag behind.

Cost and Complexity: Curbside L2 chargers are unreliable for high-mileage fleets, and private investments (e.g., Revel's superhubs) are still nascent.

Policy Delays: The TLC's delayed release of its FHV License Review report and legal challenges (e.g., the NYC Taxi Workers Alliance's lawsuit) risk further delays.

Without swift progress, the 2030 deadline may be unrealistic, forcing the TLC to revise benchmarks—a risk for investors betting on strict compliance.

Policy Support: A Double-Edged Sword

Federal and state incentives aim to bridge the EV cost gap. Tax credits, rebates, and subsidies could push EVs to price parity with gas vehicles by 2027, but timing is critical. Meanwhile, New York's mandate to sell only ZEVs after 2035 reinforces the long-term shift.

However, policy support is uneven:

Subsidies vs. Realities: While drivers qualify for up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, many lack the liquidity to wait for refunds.

Penalties for Non-Compliance: While undefined in detail, fines for missing annual targets (e.g., $50 per 1,000 underperforming trips) could pressure companies to subsidize drivers or risk penalties.

Investment Plays: Winners and Losers in the Transition

Opportunities in EV Infrastructure

Charging Network Operators:

ChargePoint (CHPT): A leader in public and commercial EV charging, with partnerships across industries.

EVgo: Specializes in fast-charging networks, critical for rideshare drivers needing quick turnaround.

Revel (private): Expanding superhubs in NYC could position it for future listings or acquisitions.

Tech and Software Partners:

Blink Charging (BLNK): Provides hardware and software solutions for fleet electrification.

Smart-charging platforms: Companies like Volta or Electrify America offering grid management tools may gain traction.

Ride-Sharing Stocks: Proceed with Caution

Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT): Both face headwinds. While they've pledged to go all-electric by 2030, their ability to incentivize drivers (via bonuses, discounted leases, or infrastructure partnerships) will determine their competitiveness. Investors should monitor their EV fleet adoption rates and any regulatory fines.

Risk Factor: If infrastructure lags or penalties escalate, costs could squeeze margins.

Equity Plays in EV Manufacturing

Tesla (TSLA): Dominates the luxury EV market, but its lack of rideshare-specific models limits direct exposure.

NIO (NIO) or Rivian (RIVN): Potential for rideshare-focused vehicles, though both face execution risks.

Conclusion: Balance Risk and Reward

New York's Green Rides Mandate is a pivotal test case for urban electrification. Investors should:

Favor infrastructure plays: Charging networks and tech partners are foundational to the mandate's success.

Monitor Uber/Lyft's adaptability: Their ability to support drivers financially and politically will determine long-term viability.

Beware regulatory risks: Delays or penalties could disrupt timelines and investor sentiment.

The path to 2030 is bumpy, but for those positioned to navigate it, the rewards—including cleaner cities and a $200 billion global EV infrastructure market—could be transformative.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 19:07:47.533421

Energy Secretary Chris Wright is defending the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate wind and solar subsidies as part of a broader tax cut package, arguing that renewable energy sources actually make electricity more expensive rather than cheaper. Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive, contends that intermittent renewables create costly inefficiencies in the electrical grid system.

The Trump administration’s tax legislation will phase out green energy subsidies by 2026, saving an estimated $500 billion over ten years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

However, critics warn this will result in job losses, higher energy bills, and reduced grid capacity as renewable energy projects become less economically viable.

Mr. Wright challenges the conventional wisdom that renewable energy reduces costs, pointing to states like California as evidence. He notes that California, which has heavily invested in wind and solar while importing renewable power from neighboring states, has electricity prices twice as high as Florida, which focused on natural gas infrastructure instead.

The energy secretary argues that renewable sources require maintaining essentially two separate electrical grids — one for when renewable sources are producing power and another for backup when they’re not. This dual system forces traditional power plants to operate less efficiently, ramping up and down to accommodate intermittent renewable generation.

Opposition comes from Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the renewable tax credits and calls the cuts “an outright massacre.” Clean energy advocates warn that eliminating subsidies will force consumers to pay higher costs for unsubsidized renewable projects or drive utilities back to more expensive fossil fuels.

Mr. Wright specifically praised President Trump’s executive order blocking offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard, describing offshore wind as among the most expensive energy sources globally. He cited Connecticut as an example where offshore wind was projected to cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, almost double the cost of the state’s nuclear power plant.

The energy secretary believes the policy changes will encourage states to pivot toward more reliable baseload power sources like natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. He argues this shift will ultimately reduce energy costs by eliminating the inefficiencies created by intermittent renewable sources.

Critics counter that transitioning away from renewables toward natural gas would require years of permitting and construction for new plants, potentially leaving grids short of capacity and consumers facing higher prices during the transition period.

**STATE-BY-STATE FACT SHEET** Republicans Slash Vital Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Funding for States

WASHINGTON — House Appropriations Committee Republicans today released the draft fiscal year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies funding bill, which will be considered in subcommittee tomorrow. The bill raises costs for American households, undermines infrastructure investments, and weakens our national security.

For 2026, the Energy and Water bill provides $57.3 billion in discretionary funding. Within that amount, the bill provides $24.1 billion for nondefense programs, a cut of over $675 million, or 2.7 percent, below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level, and $33.2 billion for defense programs, a cut of $91 million, or 0.3 percent, below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

The legislation:

Increases energy costs, jeopardizes energy independence, and hurts United States’ competitiveness by slashing the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs nearly in half, revoking more than $5 billion from the Department of Energy’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources, and eliminating funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Weakens national security and leaves Americans more vulnerable to nuclear threats by cutting the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account by 17 percent.

Abandons commitments to communities to clean up radioactive waste by eliminating funding for the Corps of Engineers’ Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program and cutting the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management by 9 percent.

“House Republicans have once again produced a reckless and short-sighted proposal that betrays working families and undermines America’s future.

It also weakens vital nuclear nonproliferation programs that help keep our country and allies safe. By turning their backs on communities still suffering from the legacy of our early atomic weapons programs, Republicans show how little regard they have for America’s promises. We must invest in our energy independence in perpetuity — not abandon it. I strongly oppose this bill and will continue fighting for policies that uplift our communities and secure our energy future for all the generations to come.”

“Once again, instead of working to find ways to address the cost-of-living crisis, House Republicans introduced a bill that would make the problem worse,” Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT-03) said. “Middle class, working class, and vulnerable Americans continue to struggle to pay their bills, but House Republicans’ 2026 Energy and Water funding proposal slashes resources for programs that lower energy costs for families and businesses and eliminates resources that provide clean, affordable, secure energy to households. While President Trump continues to inflame tensions with our adversaries, House Republicans' bill would leave our country more vulnerable to nuclear threats and yield American leadership of the world’s energy future to China. With this bill, Republicans are failing to confront the climate crisis and putting tens of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs at risk. This legislation is an attack on the country’s energy future.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 22:06:14.595732

“A couple of floors have already been leased to our partners from Europe who are coming over,” Darling said.
County Commissioners voted in early 2024 to begin negotiations with the company to purchase the 63-acre SunRail site for the Green Garden Village campus.
The expansion site for phase 2, south of the Falcon Trace II apartments, will initially be developed as a large pond for floodplain mitigation.
Darling said the stormwater pond in the northeast corner of the site will then be expanded in phase 2.","French green energy company CMG CleanTech is on track to break ground this November on its long-awaited $500 million Green Garden Village campus at the Poinciana SunRail Station site.

CEO John Darling told GrowthSpotter the first phase will include the first factory, a data center, and a 6-story office building that will serve as corporate headquarters for the company’s U.S. affiliate, Panacea Global Energy.

“A couple of floors have already been leased to our partners from Europe who are coming over,” Darling said. Panacea recently named Craig Miller as chief financial officer, and he’s currently assembling his executive staff. “We’re not bringing anybody from outside the United States. I want to build the whole thing as an American team.”

The 50,000-square-foot factory will be the first of seven manufacturing facilities planned for the campus, and the only one the first phase. It will produce solar-assisted heat pump water heaters. Darling said he believes there will still be a market for the company’s clean energy products despite the recent passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminates incentives and tax credits for solar panels and related products.

“It hasn’t altered our business strategy,” Darling said. “The reason why it hasn’t altered it is because people will always buy a product that can deliver them lower-cost energies. The issue within the market is there are products out, but they’re very expensive, and so the investment is too long.”

Darling said the company has already sold about 22,000 solar-assisted heat pumps in the U.S. “That product is a real jewel in the crown of the suite of products that we have in the business,” he said.

The 100,000-square-foot data center will be designed to be as carbon-neutral as possible. Darling said Duke Energy has signed on to build a 10-megawatt substation, and Panacea will install a solar film system on the roof, combined with hydrogen fuel cells and battery storage to reduce the energy demand by 25 megawatts.

“The data center will be run as green as we possibly can,” Darling said. The user will be a “national company” and global leader, he said, but he couldn’t reveal the name because he signed a non-disclosure agreement.

Darling said the Phase 1 buildings should be completed in 2027. The entire campus will be constructed using RENCO building blocks. The development team consists of Turner Construction, construction manager; Little Diversified, architecture; and KPM Franklin, civil engineers.

A 20,000-square-foot welcome center will be constructed just north of the SunRail station. The first floor will function as a product showroom, while the second floor will be an educational center for employee training. The first phase is expected to generate about 250 jobs.

The site plan, which was submitted to the county last week, also shows a pair of mixed-use buildings that will have a state-of-the-art wellness center and gym on the first floor and 80 residential units on the upper floors.

The final component of Phase 1 is a soccer pitch with men’s and women’s locker rooms and stadium seating for about 2,500. The company is recruiting coaches and trainers from Europe to help establish a full academy.

“It’s going to have a British pub-style restaurant in there, as well,” Darling said. “But we are going to be actively looking within the local community for different soccer clubs that want to get involved with us.”

CMG Clean Tech has been working with Osceola County since 2023, when it first submitted a bid to purchase county-owned property next to Valencia College’s Poinciana campus. The company later shifted its focus to the Poinciana SunRail property due to intense opposition because of its location close to residential neighborhoods and fears about the safety of the proposed hydrogen plant.

County Commissioners voted in early 2024 to begin negotiations with the company to purchase the 63-acre SunRail site for the Green Garden Village campus. County Manager Don Fisher told GrowthSpotter the company has met all of the benchmarks set in the memorandum of understanding.

“They’re on schedule, and they did meet that deadline,” Fisher said. “So I gave them a little bit more time to respond to some of the questions that we had. But they’re in a good spot right now.”

Darling said the design team has been working with FEMA, the South Florida Water Management District, and Osceola County for about 14 months to create a site plan that meets the environmental standards without having to reduce the scope of the project, which still aims to create 1,200 high-paying jobs. The solution was to split the project into two phases.

The expansion site for phase 2, south of the Falcon Trace II apartments, will initially be developed as a large pond for floodplain mitigation. Darling said the stormwater pond in the northeast corner of the site will then be expanded in phase 2.

“And then that will allow us then to use the area to the west for six more industrial buildings,” he said. Those factories will produce next-generation solar film products, solar panels, hydrogen fuel cells, lithium batteries and EV charging systems.",https://www.growthspotter.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2020/07/30/FN7LZ5LBQNCHTBKDBURYVXHXKM.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:32.818899

Without more funding, connecting the remaining 10,000 Navajo families without electricity could take another two decades, Becenti says.
""My mom and dad were in their 20s, they were promised power,"" but it never materialized, she says.","Workmen plant electricity poles in the rust-orange earth of the Navajo Nation and run cables to Christine Shorty's house—finally giving her power against the searing Arizona desert heat.

It will be a luxury in the vast Native American reservation, the largest in the United States, where more than 10,000 families are still without electricity and therefore air conditioning.

""It's climate change. It's getting hotter,"" Shorty tells AFP.

""This would be easier for us with the fan and maybe air conditioning. And we look forward to that.""

In her 70 years, Shorty has seen her isolated, tiny hamlet of Tonalea, a dot in the enormous area of the reservation, change dramatically.

Summer monsoon rains are rarer, and temperatures can touch 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) in July and August—previously unthinkable in the hamlet, located on a plateau at an altitude of 5,700 feet (1,730 meters).

The area's seasonal lakes are drying up, and in some years the livestock are dying of thirst.

Like many others, Shorty has a generator and small solar panels that allow her to power a gas fridge, cook and watch television.

But their power is limited, and she often has to choose which appliance to plug in.

Being hooked up to the electrical grid is ""a big change. It's going to make my life a lot easier,"" she tells AFP.

'Survival mode'

Most of the United States was electrified in the 1930s under President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal initiatives.

But in the Navajo Nation, which stretches across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the first efforts only began in the 1960s, and there are still not enough power lines.

""This area was looked over,"" says Deenise Becenti of the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA), the agency that manages the reservation's infrastructure.

""That surprises many people. They're saying, you know, why are there third world conditions that exist here in the United States, the greatest country in the world?""

To catch up, the semi-autonomous government of the reservation launched the ""Light Up Navajo"" project in 2019.

The humanitarian initiative sees electricity companies from all over the country send their employees to work in the reservation for around a dozen weeks a year.

Since 2019, electricity has been supplied to 5,000 families in the reservation, including 1,000 thanks to ""Light Up Navajo,"" Becenti said.

But as climate change drives temperatures higher, families still without power in the reservation—where many live below the poverty rate and unemployment is high—are in ""survival mode,"" she said.

'Angry'

Elbert Yazzie's mobile home turns into a furnace in the summer, and he has already lost one member of his extended family to heat stroke.

""I used to like the heat,"" the 54-year-old, who lives in nearby Tuba City, tells AFP.

""But when you get older I guess your body can't take it no more.""

His home was finally connected to electricity just weeks ago.

Since then, he has rigged up an evaporative air cooler, also known as a ""swamp cooler,"" by salvaging three broken appliances from a garbage dump.

""Now we can turn on the A/C anytime we want, so we don't have to worry about the heat, and the generator and the gas, and all that stuff,"" he says.

""Now we don't have to go to (other) people's houses to cool down, we can just stay home, relax, watch TV, things like that.""

He and Shorty are the fortunate ones.

Without more funding, connecting the remaining 10,000 Navajo families without electricity could take another two decades, Becenti says.

That is far too long for Gilberta Cortes, who no longer dares let her children play outside in the summer, for fear of getting heat-exacerbated nosebleeds.

An electricity pole has just been erected in front of the 42-year-old's house and a line is due to be extended to her in a few months' time.

But she has endured too much false hope to be serene.

""My mom and dad were in their 20s, they were promised power,"" but it never materialized, she says.

""I'm still angry.""

The shaded areas of the map show the approximate boundaries where air quality is available and listed as anything other than good.
Air Quality Index guidelines (ozone and particle pollution) Some people are more sensitive to air pollution because of their age or health.
People who are active or work outdoors are also at higher risk when the air quality is poor.","The entire state of Michigan is under an air quality alert now through all of Monday, July 14.

Elevated levels of fine particulate (PM2.5) due to residual wildfire smoke from Canada is causing the alert, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said on X.

The smoke will continue to move into Michigan on Sunday across the Upper Peninsula and the northern portion of the Lower Peninsula, the NWS says. It is expected to track east and south, expanding to the rest of Michigan as the day goes on and additional smoke is expected Monday.

""Pollutants across the state are expected to reach the Unhealthy (Red AQI) to USG (Orange AQI) range in northern locations, with ranges of USG to Moderate further south,"" NWS says.

Photos provided Sunday, July 13, by the Mackinac Bridge Authority show the Mighty Mac disappearing into the smoke from the wildfires.

The NWS recommends avoiding strenuous outdoor activities when possible, especially for people with heart disease and respiratory diseases like asthma.

Individuals should monitor for symptoms, including wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, dizziness or burning in the nose, throat or eyes.

It's recommended to reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning or use of residential wood burning devices. Avoiding activities that can lead to ozone formation like refueling vehicles or topping off when refueling, using gasoline powered lawn equipment and using charcoal lighter fluid is advised.

Although Michigan's ozone season generally runs between the warmer months of March and October, particle pollution from sources like power plants, vehicle emissions and industry can reach unhealthy levels year-round. Some of these pollutants are so small, PM2.5, they can be inhaled into your lungs and can even enter your bloodstream with serious health consequences. Other sources of particle pollution include unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfire smoke.

Michigan's current air quality

The map below displays the current air quality at monitoring sites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Air monitoring sites are color-coded based on the pollutant (ozone or particulate matter) with the highest value. Particles that are less than 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers in diameter are called PM10 and PM2.5, respectively.

An AQI of 50 or below means the current air quality is good. The shaded areas of the map show the approximate boundaries where air quality is available and listed as anything other than good. The information is updated hourly.

Air Quality Index guidelines (ozone and particle pollution)

Some people are more sensitive to air pollution because of their age or health. People who are active or work outdoors are also at higher risk when the air quality is poor. Health concerns related to poor air quality may include difficulty breathing, coughing or wheezing and more serious health effects such as lung damage, asthma attacks, heart attacks and stroke.

Here's how to interpret the Air Quality Index values, according to the U.S. EPA:

Good (0-50): The level of pollution in the air is of little to no risk.

Moderate (51-100): For people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution, a moderate health concern may exist.

Unhealthy for sensitive groups (101-150): People who are more sensitive to air pollution may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.

Unhealthy (151-200): Some people may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.

Very unhealthy (201-300): An alert is triggered; the general population is at risk for more serious health effects.

Hazardous (301-500): Emergency conditions health alert: Everyone is likely to be affected.

Economic and public health impacts are also affected by using coal such as increased healthcare costs due to respiratory illnesses and other health issues caused by air pollution. These health issues also result in lost productivity and higher healthcare expenditures. More jobs can be created by switching to renewable energy and will give communities like Estevan and Coronach, they say, real opportunities for the future.

The coalition says Saskatchewan must move forward with policies that ensure healthy communities, economic reconciliation, clean air, a stable climate, and sustainable jobs for generations to come.

The coalition is calling for:

-An immediate halt to the coal fleet rebuild

-Compliance with Canada’s 2030 coal phase-out mandate

-A just transition strategy for coal-dependent communities such as Estevan and Coronach

-Major public investment in renewables, storage, energy efficiency, and grid modernization

-Respect for Indigenous rights and clean energy partnerships with Indigenous communities and governments, particularly given the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate disasters on Indigenous and rural communities.

Guinness World Record Lucid Grand Longest EV Drive

Lucid Group has set a new GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS title after its Lucid Air Grand Touring drove 1,205 kilometers (approximately 749 miles) on a single charge, surpassing the previous record by 160 kilometers. The journey, from St. Moritz, Switzerland to Munich, Germany, showcased Lucid’s advanced electric powertrain and efficiency, reaffirming its leadership in EV range and performance.

Global Light-Duty Market Drive to Electrification

A new report from Guidehouse Research forecasts a major shift in the global light-duty vehicle (LDV) market, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) leading the transition. In 2024, BEVs are expected to account for 15% of global LDV sales, but that figure is projected to rise dramatically to 53% by 2033—representing a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Meanwhile, traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will see a steep decline from nearly 65% of sales in 2024 to just under 20% in 2033. The report highlights this shift as part of a broader global effort toward decarbonization and sustainable transportation.

Despite growing momentum, the transition to full electrification faces significant hurdles. Charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier in many regions, and some governments have slowed climate-related initiatives, prompting automakers to scale back earlier commitments. In addition, political and economic uncertainty—especially in the wake of the 2024 U.S. presidential election—has led to a more cautious investment environment. Still, Guidehouse analysts believe that the electrification trend is irreversible, as the combined forces of regulation, innovation, and consumer demand continue to drive growth.

The report, Light Duty Vehicle Electrification, outlines sales projections for various vehicle types, including BEVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), and ICEs. It analyzes how factors like government incentives and lower cost-per-mile will influence market dynamics through 2033. While the road to full electrification may include detours and delays, the report underscores that EVs are poised to dominate the LDV market in the years ahead.

Ford, Michigan Battery Plant “On Track” for Federal Tax Credits

Ford’s $3 billion battery plant in Marshall, Michigan—currently 60% complete—is expected to qualify for federal battery-cell production tax credits under the newly adjusted tax bill. The plant, set to begin production in 2026 and employ around 1,700 workers, had faced eligibility concerns due to its use of technology licensed from China’s CATL. An automakers’ group praised recent policy adjustments that preserve credits while excluding direct foreign ownership.

Panasonic Delays Kansas Battery Plant with Tesla

Panasonic is postponing the full-scale ramp-up of its Kansas EV battery plant, originally planned to reach 30 GWh capacity by March 2027. The delay is linked to cooling Tesla demand, as the plant was primarily built to serve Tesla’s needs. While initial production will continue, the timeline for reaching full capacity remains uncertain.

Automakers Push EV Sales Ahead of $7,500 Tax Credit Expiry

U.S. automakers are stepping up incentives, including offers like free home chargers, as the $7,500 federal EV tax credit is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2025. Industry analysts warn that EV registrations could drop as much as 27% without the credit, prompting companies to fast-track promotions and sales efforts in the coming months.

Tesla Stock Wobbles on Battery and Political Headwinds

Tesla’s stock remains under pressure amid delays in Panasonic’s Kansas battery facility and increasing political controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. Although the stock saw a mild rebound, it remains down 2% for the week and 23% for the year. Slowing EV demand, reduced incentives, and an aging product lineup are all contributing to investor uncertainty.

EV Charger Tax Credit Remains but Faces Earlier Expiration

Same thing for businesses and utilities.

While many of HR1’s cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance won’t kick in until after the 2026 midterm elections congress made sure the elimination of clean energy incentives is immediate.

HR1 rapidly ends federal tax credits that have helped ordinary homeowners (like us, when I installed rooftop solar two years ago) afford clean energy upgrades.

We Installed a Solar Power System at Our House: This is Our Story – AZ Public Health Association

That includes a soon to expire 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, which helped thousands of Arizonans install solar panels, batteries, and other home efficiency improvements.

That tax credit will be eliminated on December 31, 2025, with no phase-out and no grace period. To qualify for a tax credit systems must be fully installed & connected to the grid before the deadline New Years Day 2026 (not just contracted).

The timeline is even tighter for EVs. The $7,500 new EV tax credit and $4,000 used EV credit both expire on September 30, 2025.

And for businesses and utilities?

The bill strips away the long-term certainty they’d counted on as many businesses, community health centers (like Chiricahua), and utilities made plans to convert to a bigger renewable portfolio. To qualify for the Investment Tax Credit, business and utility projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be connected and in service by the end of 2027.

HR1’s elimination of tax incentives to invest in clean energy will slow down but not end the conversion to renewables as the ROI for clean energy projects is rapidly becoming the least expensive way to boost power generation even without the tax credits. In addition, new solar components in panels that source less and less expensive, improving the ROI.

Note: Tariffs on solar panels from China are also impeding conversion to solar as China is a global leader in production of inexpensive solar panels. Same goes for electric vehicles – which have a 100% tariff imposed on them.

If you’ve been thinking about solar or an EV the time to act is now. With the coming ‘gold rush’ of solar installation that’ll be created by the impending end of the credits, permitting delays, installer backlogs, and supply chain snags… you better get started NOW.

The Republican majority in Congress may have delayed politically sensitive cuts to healthcare and nutrition assistance but they’ve fast-tracked the end of clean energy support.

Grounding conversations in how climate change affects pocketbooks — such as rising insurance premiums — also moves people.","Their targets would include the moderate Republicans who spent months urging Congress to preserve the Biden tax breaks because of their projected economic gains for GOP-held districts — only to fold and vote for Trump’s bill anyway. Trump is moving aggressively to enforce the law, ordering agencies to hasten the phase-out of green energy incentives despite a widespread consensus that the U.S. will need to ramp up electricity from all sources to meet the growing power demands of artificial intelligence.

“Democrats now have the high ground of price and Republicans are now the party of electricity shortages,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in an interview. “We’re just not going to have enough electrons to go around and the prices will go up — and that will be 100 percent because Republicans passed this ridiculous bill.”

Schatz added that Democrats don’t need to lead with their traditional message that clean energy is essential for dealing with climate change. “The people who care about climate are already with us,” he said.

Besides Schatz, Democratic climate leaders aligned on the new messaging include Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida. Eleven Democrats said in interviews that an emerging consensus in their party is cohering around a new campaign emphasizing pocketbook issues.

Some of the Democrats’ environmental allies are going all-in on the message. Clean Energy for America, an advocacy group, plans to plaster billboards with ads in seven swing districts attacking Republican House members who “just voted to raise your electricity bill.” Climate Power, a Democratic-aligned strategic communications operation, launched a six-figure national advertisement playing heavily on Fox News contending that the GOP’s policies renege on Trump’s promise to lower prices.

Republicans scoffed at the notion that Democrats will succeed in promoting themselves as energy price populists.

“It’s tough for the Democrats because they’ve made climate their energy priority for decades,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former aide to then-Sen. Marco Rubio who is a partner at Firehouse Strategies. “Voters associate liberals with prioritizing climate change over energy affordability.”

Also inconvenient for the Democrats is the fact that oil prices are hovering near four-year lows, GOP strategist Ford O’Connell said. So even if Democrats cling to a message that Republican policies raise energy prices, he said, those price hikes are unlikely to show up in the real world before the midterms.

“That’s just something that Democrats keep saying over and over, but it’s just not going to be true because the argument defies gravity,” O’Connell said.

Blaming Republicans for future energy price increases is “too abstract,” said David Victor, an expert on climate change and energy markets who works as a professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California San Diego. He added that for people who simply believe that green energy is expensive, the Democratic counterargument will be drowned out.

“People don’t believe it,” he said. “All kinds of claims are being made.”

Try, try again

The Democrats’ plans to seize on the energy argument is part of a larger effort to hammer Republicans over projections that the megabill will steer huge tax breaks to the wealthy while kicking millions of poorer Americans off Medicaid.

It also recognizes the new realities of the U.S. energy markets, including the rise of AI data centers and the fact that U.S. power consumption is moving up after almost 20 years of nearly flat demand.

Democrats believe the time is ripe to revive the call to speed the growth of wind and solar power — and bash the Republicans for taking the green power incentives off the table. They also contend that Trump’s law will spike power prices by making renewable electricity more expensive.

“We’re going to need to build assets for a growing grid. Choosing not to build things is fucking stupid,” Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois) said.

Castor agreed with the messaging approach, adding that her Tampa-area constituents are already well aware of how climate change is affecting their lives. But when she talks to them about what’s at stake in the Capitol and the White House, she said she focuses on “higher costs, higher electric bills.”

“Bread and butter, kitchen table issues — costs, their electric bills — are not going to see relief from Republicans,” said Castor, who chaired the now-defunct House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis when Democrats controlled the House from 2020 through 2022.

Of course, the jobs-and-prosperity message failed Democrats at the ballot box last year, possibly because the slow rollout of Biden’s $1 trillion-plus in energy, climate and infrastructure spending meant that many of its projected economic gains had not yet appeared. The Biden administration’s gargantuan spending initiatives also played little role in the campaign messaging by his would-be successor, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

One economic data point in the Democrats’ favor this time: Power bills have increased an average of 9 percent since January, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, giving Democrats a chance to try to tie any utility bill increases to the Republican law.

That upward pressure on prices is likely to accelerate, given that the U.S. doesn’t have enough power supply to meet a nearly 20-percent projected increase in demand during the next five years. And the new Republican budget law raises costs on wind and solar — even though those sources, combined with batteries, accounted for 93 percent of all new power added to the grid last year, according to the EIA.

Republicans have vowed to plug the gap with fossil fuels and nuclear energy. (Trump’s new law includes policies to boost production from those sources, for example by slashing royalties for fossil fuel production on federal land.) But orders for natural gas turbines face a years-long delay. New nuclear energy faces cost challenges and long lead times. And no utility has announced plans to build new coal-fired power plants, which still face an uncertain regulatory environment and stiff competition from other energy sources.

Economics over climate

Environmental and clean energy groups have largely swung behind the economic message.

One group in the pro-pocketbook crowd, Climate Power, called Republicans’ bill a “National Rate Hike” in a memo last month. It cited an analysis by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a trade group working with data center developers, that said repealing tax credits would raise household power bills $110 annually as early as next year.

But John Marshall, CEO of the Potential Energy Coalition, said the most persuasive way to get people to care about transitioning to clean energy and tackling planet-heating emissions is to talk about climate change more, not less.

On a matter that may be instructive for energy policy, voters prefer positions that encourage more options, not fewer, said Marshall, whose nonpartisan, nonprofit organization conducts research on climate communication. Grounding conversations in how climate change affects pocketbooks — such as rising insurance premiums — also moves people. But talk of future jobs at the national scale sounds too theoretical, he said.

“Climate is not a dirty word,” he said. “The smart play is to talk about the issue, but just talk about it in a slightly different way and make it relevant to different people’s lives.”

During last year’s campaign, supporters of the Democratic policies faced “a continual challenge” in trying to warn that Republican policies would kill future clean energy jobs and investments, said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups. But he said enough of those jobs have since materialized that it’s possible to hold GOP lawmakers accountable for businesses that close or construction projects that shut down.

“The new thing is we are moving from the abstract and the conceptual to, ‘This is what they did,’” Walsh said.

Democrats’ environmental allies also need to confront the lingering reputation of a “green premium” that leads many people to believe that wind and solar power are expensive, said Holly Burke, spokesperson for the green group Evergreen Action. In fact, wind and solar are cheaper per megawatt-hour than coal, and in many places they’re even competitive with natural gas, the United States’ dominant electricity source.

Those facts give Democrats a potential opening, Burke said.

“In October 2026 I’d be surprised if candidates are messaging on this specific bill, but what they will be messaging on is the impacts,” she said. “Your utility bill is your utility bill. Folks know Trump ran on lowering electricity costs and that Republicans are in charge.”",https://static.politico.com/ca/98/55a752c742cba72557a37fe4211c/u-s-congress-50654.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 16:08:56.734914

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.

So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.

But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.

“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.

Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.

The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.

Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.

The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

Two weeks ago, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.

“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:

“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.

But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.

Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.

“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.

On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.

Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.

But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.

He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.

The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.

“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”

A newly approved transmission line project will add thousands of megawatts (MW) to Minnesota’s energy grid, improving energy reliability and efficiency across the state.

In April, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved Xcel Energy’s Minnesota Energy Connection (MEC) transmission project. The project consists of a 174-mile, 345-kilovolt double-circuit high-voltage transmission line and related infrastructure. The MEC project will address the generation gap expected to occur when Xcel’s Sherburne County Generating Station (Sherco), a coal-fired power plant located in Becker, Minnesota, retires in 2030.

The MEC upgrade to the electric transmission system will cost-effectively deliver 2,000 MW of electricity to the Sherco Station and connect over 4,000 MW of renewable energy to the grid.

The MEC and similar projects represent vital improvements to Minnesota's aging transmission infrastructure. The Minnesota Department of Commerce’s 2023 Biennial Transmission Projects Report identified 164 current and anticipated transmission inadequacies — up from 103 in 2021.

Expanding and modernizing the grid is essential to ensuring Minnesotans can access electricity when they need it. Transmission improvements alleviate bottlenecks that have led to curtailment, a process in which energy systems are forced to temporarily halt operation due to a lack of capacity on the transmission lines.

Renewable energy projects provide a valuable source of tax revenue for rural communities, aiding in the funding of local schools, emergency services, infrastructure, and law enforcement. Projects also offer landowners a reliable source of income and create employment opportunities in rural areas. To fully capture these benefits, the state’s transmission grid must be updated to ensure it has capacity to support new, local renewable generation.

Once completed in 2028, the MEC transmission line will carry power from southwest Minnesota to the Sherco site, delivering enough electricity to serve more than 1 million homes across the Upper Midwest.

BEIJING (Reuters) -The world needs China to show more leadership on climate action, EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said on Sunday, highlighting the importance of cutting planet-heating emissions and reducing the Chinese economy’s reliance on coal.

Hoekstra is in Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials on environmental and climate issues at which he also wants to encourage China to stop building new coal-fired power plants and phase out use of the fossil fuel.

“We do encourage China to take more of a leadership role going forward and really hit the road with meaningful emission reductions in the next couple of years, and also move out of the domain of coal,” Hoekstra told Reuters in an interview.

The number of coal power plants in the pipeline has been increasing in China – the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, according to the World Economic Forum.

In the first three months this year, China’s approved 11.29 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants exceeded the approval rate in the first half of 2024, a June report by environmental group Greenpeace showed.

Last week, Hoekstra told the Financial Times the EU was holding off on signing a joint climate declaration with China unless Beijing pledges a greater commitment to reduce emissions.

“We are open to looking into a potential declaration, but … the thing that is most important about these types of statements is the content that goes into it,” he said when asked about the issue, without specifying what commitment the EU hopes to see from China.

Hoekstra said the EU is interested in seeking areas of cooperation with China ahead of the COP30 U.N. climate conference that will be held in Brazil in November.

It will hurt Americans first, particularly those in Republican states. But eventually, we will all pay.

Trump’s goal with the BBB, as it has become known, was not, firstly, to assault the world’s climate. His primary goal was to lock in tax cuts for big business and America’s wealthiest citizens.

To placate the few remaining deficit hawks in Republican congressional ranks, the BBB’s authors had to make at least a pretence of seeking to pay for some of these cuts. They did so first by stripping funding that had been directed to the benefit of America’s poorest citizens.

For example, spending cuts to healthcare and food assistance programs in the bill will average about $US1.2 trillion over the next decade, while new tax cuts for households already making over $US500,000 each year will cost about the same, the Congressional Budget Office shows.

Because this transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich will not even touch the sides when it comes to paying for the BBB, Republicans also hacked into government spending on green technology.

This serves several purposes beyond paying for some of those tax cuts. It satisfies Trump donors in the fossil fuel industry, but more importantly, it undoes the signal achievement of the Biden administration – the Inflation Reduction Act.

The IRA served as both a post-COVID stimulus measure and as the world’s single largest ever investment in fighting climate change, a vast incentive scheme for new green tech in the US. If left in place, the incentive payments and tax cuts were expected to cost $US656 billion and drive around $US2 trillion in private capital expenditure.

Republican “red” states, set to benefit most from the IRA’s largesse, will now be worst hit while the BBB’s assault on the social safety net will disproportionately impact states which backed Trump.

But it will eventually hurt us all because the IRA, had it not been dismantled, would have spared the world around four billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Indeed, the total carbon cost of terminating the IRA, supercharging the US fossil fuel industry, and various other Trump executive actions, is now estimated to be around 7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Or, as the specialist climate publication CarbonBrief notes, around the total annual output of Indonesia, the world’s sixth-largest carbon emitter.

According to an analysis by Princeton University’s REPEAT project, US emissions are now set to fall by just 3 per cent by 2030, rather than the 40 per cent required should the US have reached its abandoned Paris Agreement target. This is around four per cent of current total global emissions each year.

This is the price we must all pay for Trump’s BBB, in both the incalculable increase in the impact and incidence of climate catastrophes over the coming years, and in the cost of offsetting those lost cuts by increasing the burden on other nations.

That Trump does not care about the global impact of domestic policies is no surprise. But what is harder to fathom is the costs he is willing to heap upon Americans.

Trump’s various climate and energy policies, including those in his BBB and the trashing of the IRA, plus his various executive orders, will see Americans paying more for dirtier sources of energy.

It will see a decrease in clean electricity generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours – more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to its electricity supply today. It will increase US household and business energy expenditure by US$28 billion annually by 2030 and over $US50 billion by 2035, according to REPEAT.

Average US household energy costs will increase by around $US165 per household per year in 2030.

Even more perversely, the initiatives will lock the US out of competition with China for a share of the technologies of the future beyond wind and solar. The burgeoning EV industry is being crippled not just by a loss of incentives and tax breaks for battery development, but by sanctions on the Chinese components the industry will need in the absence of US alternatives.

“We are in a global competition with China, and it’s not just EVs. And if we lose this, we do not have a future Ford,” Ford’s chief executive Jim Farley said at a conference last month, describing recent visits to China as the “most humbling experience” of his life.

Tellingly, even as Trump abandons the industries of the future with his BBB, he has propped up not just those of the fossil fuel era, but even one that came before. To secure the crucial support of the Alaskan senator Lisa Murkowski Trump found the cash to increase tax deductions for Alaskan subsistence whaling.

Indeed, by the time the bill had been forced through Congress, it had gathered so many tax cuts and pay-offs that it failed to pay for itself. Rather, over the next decade it will add US$2.5 trillion to the already eye-bleeding US debt of $US36.8 trillion.

Climate advocates have been locked in a debate over whether the only way to save the climate would be to destroy the global economy. Over recent years optimists had begun to toy with the notion that perhaps the revolution in green tech over recent years, such as the 90 per cent collapse in the cost of solar power, might just allow us to preserve both.

With his sprawling omnibus bill, a “showcase for fiscal incontinence and ideological exhaustion” in the words of The Economist, it is as though Trump has concluded that with enough effort, both could be destroyed at once.

While criticised by environmentalists, officials claim the recalibration is efficient and climate-conscious.

NEW DELHI: The mandatory retrofitting of coal-fired generation plants with mechanisms to reduce sulphur emission will apply to only units within 10 km of cities with population exceeding 10 lakh instead of all power stations under a 2015 mandate. The revised policy, notified on Saturday, is expected to reduce the cost of power by 25-30 paise per unit, officials and experts involved in the revision of the earlier mandate for installation of FGD (flue gas desulphurisation) units at all power plants said. The new norm lets off the hook 79% of the country’s thermal generation capacity, a fact that environmental activists have used to criticise the revision. But officials argued that the “evidence-based recalibration” makes the policy “focused, efficient and climate-conscious."" For example, they said, under the revised policy, new plants in critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis instead of an omnibus application that would push up the cost of power. The notification justified the revision, saying it is in line with the analysis by the Central Pollution Control Board, which found increased carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the operation of existing control measures. Additionally, studies by IIT-Delhi, CSIR-NEERI and the National Institute of Advanced Studies put ambient sulphur dioxide levels in most parts of the country within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Power producers have been opposing the blanket FGD mandate for all plants due to the high cost involved. Industry estimates put the cost of installing FGDs at all power plants at Rs 2.5 lakh crore, or Rs 1.2 crore per megawatt. This, industry representatives had said, would jack up tariff for consumers. Additionally, the average timeline of 45 days for each unit was also cited as a threat to grid stability during peak seasons. Differentiated compliance based on proximity to urban populations and the sulphur content of the coal used will ease the burden on power producers, industry executives said. Indian coal typically has a sulphur content of less than 0.5% and due to high stack heights and favourable meteorological conditions, dispersion of SO2 is efficient. Measurements across multiple cities showed sulphur oxide levels ranging between 3 and 20 micrograms per cubic meter, significantly below the NAAQS threshold of 80 micrograms per cubic meter. The officials said studies had also questioned the environmental and economic efficacy of a universal FGD mandate in the Indian context.

The sweeping legislation rolls back critical incentives for solar, wind, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient home improvements. The result: billions in lost investment, tens of thousands of lost jobs, and a rising sense of uncertainty among Arizona energy leaders.

A Devastating Blow: Solar and Wind Incentives Slashed

Immediate Consequences for Arizona Households and Businesses

The bill eliminates a series of federal tax credits that had helped fuel Arizona’s clean energy boom, including:

The 30% federal solar tax credit (worth about $9,000 per average installation)

Incentives for wind energy installations

Credits for purchasing electric vehicles

Home energy-efficiency upgrades

Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), these credits were originally scheduled to run through 2036. Trump’s budget bill not only ends them prematurely but also authorizes federal agencies to accelerate their removal through executive action.

As a result, Arizona residents and businesses now have only until the end of the year to capitalize on federal incentives for clean energy installations.

$58 Billion in Investment and 69,000 Jobs at Risk

Governor Katie Hobbs, in a letter to lawmakers during the bill’s debate, warned of dire economic consequences. She cited Arizona Commerce Authority figures that estimate the rollback could jeopardize:

$58 billion in planned and potential clean energy investments

69,000 high-paying construction and tech sector jobs

“These are real projects, real workers, and real dollars walking out the door,” said Michael Barrio of Advanced Energy United.

Clean Energy Projects Already Collapsing Across the State

A Wave of Closures and Cancellations

Since the bill’s passage, Arizona has seen multiple clean energy projects halted or cancelled:

Meyer Burger, a solar panel manufacturer, shuttered its Goodyear facility in May.

Nikola, an electric vehicle producer, cut 855 jobs in February.

A $1B battery plant in Buckeye was scrapped, eliminating more than 6,000 anticipated jobs.

A Casa Grande solar and electric boiler project, which would have slashed emissions by 90%, was cancelled after federal funding dried up.

Autumn Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, said industry installs are at their lowest levels since COVID. Several companies have gone bankrupt in recent months, and many more are in limbo due to mounting economic uncertainty.

Arizona’s Energy Future in Jeopardy

Climbing Utility Rates and Demand Collide with Policy Rollbacks

Arizona’s largest utility, Arizona Public Service, is proposing a 14% rate hike this year, following multiple increases in recent years. The rising cost of electricity, paired with record-breaking summer heat and population growth, puts additional strain on Arizona families.

Complicating matters further is the rise of AI and data-driven industries, which are dramatically increasing energy demand.

Clean Energy: The Only Scalable, Rapid Solution?

Energy advocates argue that renewables are the only viable short-term option to meet this surging demand. Nuclear power, often touted as an alternative, takes over a decade to build, while other technologies are still in their infancy.

“We have the sunshine and the open land,” said Johnson. “But we’re falling behind states like Texas, which have embraced renewables across party lines.”

Political Gridlock Threatens Local Response

State Lawmakers Divided as Federal Pullback Intensifies

Despite the crisis, local legislative efforts to support clean energy in Arizona have largely failed. The only pro-clean energy bill died in committee, while Governor Hobbs has vetoed several anti-clean energy proposals. The Republican-controlled legislature continues to show little interest in bridging the gap.

Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club put it bluntly: “I’m not optimistic. This federal bill is damaging, and our legislature is unlikely to act to protect Arizona’s future.”

Autumn Johnson added that while some challenges — like tariffs — are federal issues, state leaders can still step up by supporting in-state development, incentivizing adoption, and offering policy stability.

A Call for State Action: “We Still Hold the Steering Wheel”

Michael Barrio remains hopeful that Arizona can take its energy future into its own hands — if state leaders act quickly.

“Washington tapped the brakes,” he said. “But we can still grab the steering wheel and hit the accelerator. The opportunity hasn’t completely passed us by.”

Conclusion: A Fork in the Road for Arizona’s Clean Energy Future

Arizona stands on the brink of a clean energy collapse, brought on by sweeping federal changes and a lack of local legislative urgency. Yet, the state also holds the tools — abundant sunshine, open land, and a skilled workforce — to lead the renewable revolution.",https://actia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trumps-Tax-Plan-Cuts-Clean-Energy-Incentives-Putting-Billions-in-Arizona-Investment-at-Risk.webp,N,,2025-07-13 18:11:05.400522

While investing in such projects may seem “plain vanilla” and also increasingly competitive –given the falling prices of solar electricity – these technologies are deemed to be “geopolitically resilient” as they are “scaled opportunities” with a “narrower range of outcomes”, said Temasek’s senior executives.

Solar energy projects combined with energy storage can be deployed faster than conventional forms of energy. It is also becoming one of the cheapest forms of energy around the world, while being inflation-protected and cashflow-generating, said Park Kyung-Ah, chief sustainability officer of Temasek.

“The opportunity sets are very compelling. People probably over-index to a lot of the headlines that keep coming out, whether it’s tariffs on certain clean energy supply chain or whether it’s in the context of pulling out of certain (climate) commitments and so forth. But we have to remember, at the end of the day for the market, the economics are what really matters,” said Park, who was speaking to The Business Times at the recent launch of its 2025 sustainability report.

Even though solar prices are falling across the board, thereby affecting the returns of such investments, Park said that there are ways to make returns by entering some markets earlier, and leveraging some of the development opportunity sets.

“It is becoming more sustainable infrastructure, which is again, more resilient, bigger growth opportunity set and cashflow visibility. And so it’s actually a compelling part of our portfolio construction,” she added.

The dislocation of some renewable energy companies in the public market – due to uncertainty around energy transition globally as the US dialled back on its climate commitments – has also provided the investor with more attractive opportunities, said chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani.

For example, Temasek, along with its partner Brookfield, acquired listed French renewable energy company Neoen for US$6.6 billion and took it private in December last year.

The pivot towards renewable energy is part of Temasek’s risk management strategy amid heightened volatility in sustainability investing. Spurred by US President Donald Trump pulling the country out of the Paris Agreement and rolling back some policies incentivising clean energy development, there has been a broader reassessment among governments and corporates on their climate ambition and strategies.

In addition to leaning more towards renewable energy, Park said the Singapore investment company would be “more selective and intentional” when investing in early stage companies.

“So we are doing early stage deals, but where there’s true differentiation and innovation, as well as where we see companies really cementing their competitive differentiation, scaling and go-to market,” she added.

Climate commitments

Despite the scaling back of climate ambition globally, Temasek said that it will stay on course for its net-zero targets.

In 2020, the investor made a commitment to halve its portfolio emissions from its 2010 levels by 2030 – to 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and is also targeting to be net zero by 2050.

For one, while the US might be retreating, Franziska Zimmermann, managing director for sustainability at Temasek, said that the European Union as a collective is still advancing on sustainability, and would likely not be impacted by developments in the US.

Secondly, Park said that delayed climate action will actually result in higher costs further down the road.

In addition, she noted that while policy stability provides investors with confidence in the return profile, Temasek does not make investment decisions with policy dependencies in mind.

“When we do our investment thesis, we want the companies to stand on their legs... There will be bumpiness along the way. And it’s the case with any industry in any market. It’s never a glide path, but the opportunity sets are very compelling,” she added.

The shifting landscape on climate has also meant that Temasek is currently in the process of revising some of its underlying assumptions behind its climate scenarios.

The investor’s current baseline scenario, which projects temperatures to rise by 1.8 degree Celsius by 2100, assumes significant acceleration in climate policy by 2025 with higher upfront transition costs.

The recent policy actions from the US, as well as the latest results from climate science, would now be factored in as part of this review, said Zimmermann.

The portfolio value of Temasek’s sustainability-aligned investments stood at S$46 billion for FY2025, an increase of S$2 billion from S$44 billion in the previous financial year.

However, the investor’s share of sustainability investments – out of its entire portfolio – dipped slightly, accounting for 11 per cent of its net portfolio value of S$434 billion after including institutional assets and liabilities, compared to 12 per cent in the previous year.

The sustainability report also reviewed Temasek’s total portfolio emissions for FY2025, which remained unchanged at 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

A majority of emissions (42.9 per cent) were attributable to Singapore Airlines, which generated higher emissions due to a strong demand for air travel and cargo uplift.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/75995b3b887981259bb57cb20a5d527d2bd4e36bd19c3edfa058abaeedbcd5ec?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-07-13 17:06:50.411948

This is after the deadline for installing FGD systems, initially slated for 2017, was repeatedly pushed, the Congress general secretary said.
Estimates suggest that anywhere between 12 per cent to 30 per cent of PM2.5 is attributable to such sulphur dioxide compounds, he said.
“The Ministry claims that sulphur dioxide levels in India are largely within the limits of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
India established stringent sulphur dioxide emission standards for coal-based power plants in December 2015, requiring compliance within two years.","With the government exempting about 78 cent per cent of coal-fired plants from installing key anti-polluting systems, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said the Environment Ministry’s rationale for the policy is based on “faulty premises”.

He asserted that the government’s policymaking will continue to be driven by “flawed metrics” in the absence of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) revision.

The former environment minister attacked the government after the central government once again extended the deadline for coal-based thermal power plants to comply with sulphur dioxide emission norms and fully exempted those located away from critically polluted areas or cities with a population of over one million.

“The Modi Government has already achieved the dubious distinction of having made India the global leader in sulphur dioxide emissions. Now we learn that the Environment Ministry has exempted 78-89 per cent of India’s thermal power plants from installing flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) systems that cut sulphur dioxide emissions,” Ramesh said in a social media post.

This is after the deadline for installing FGD systems, initially slated for 2017, was repeatedly pushed, the Congress general secretary said.

Sulphur dioxide is a direct threat to public health and has also been known to impact cloud formation, disrupting the monsoon that is the lifeline of the Indian economy, Ramesh said.

“More damagingly, research has increasingly shown that a large part of India’s ambient PM2.5 (fine particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 mm) is attributable to secondary particulate matter formed when sulphur dioxide reacts with other compounds,” he said.

Estimates suggest that anywhere between 12 per cent to 30 per cent of PM2.5 is attributable to such sulphur dioxide compounds, he said.

“The Ministry’s rationale for this policy is based on two faulty premises. The Ministry had earlier amended the focus of the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) to focus largely on PM10 emissions (particulate matter of less than 10mm diameter).

“PM10 is a lot less dangerous to human health than PM2.5 but is more obviously visible and somewhat easier to tackle, since it includes elements such as road dust.” he said.

By choosing to turn a blind eye towards PM2.5 in its policymaking, the ministry has consigned us to many years more of our ongoing public health crisis – and this decision to tolerate sulphur dioxide compounds is only set to exacerbate this trend, he said.

“The Ministry claims that sulphur dioxide levels in India are largely within the limits of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). As we have repeatedly pointed out, the NAAQS were last updated in 2009, when the prevailing levels of particulate matter and emissions were of a decidedly lower order of magnitude, and when the catastrophic public health consequences of particulate matter were not known, Ramesh said.

A revision of the NAAQS therefore is long due,” he added.

In the absence of such a revision, the ministry’s policymaking will continue to be driven by flawed metrics, Ramesh said.

India established stringent sulphur dioxide emission standards for coal-based power plants in December 2015, requiring compliance within two years.

Even after multiple extensions, 92 per cent of coal-fired power plants have not yet installed flue gas desulphurisation units to control SO2 emissions, a major air pollutant that converts into fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and causes a range of diseases.

In a notification dated July 11, the Environment Ministry said the compliance deadline for Category A plants, located within a 10-km radius of the National Capital Region or cities with a population of over one million, has been extended from December 2024 to December 2027.

Category B plants, situated within a 10-km radius of critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities, will now be assessed on a case-by-case basis instead of adhering to the earlier 2025 deadline.

Category C plants -- all others not falling under Category A or B -- have been completely exempted from the sulphur dioxide norms, provided they meet the prescribed stack height criteria by December 31, 2029. These plants were earlier required to comply by December 2026.

Of around 600 thermal power units in India, 462 are Category C units and 72 are Category B units.

The ministry said it received many representations seeking exemption or relaxation in the timelines of the emission standards due to factors such as the “limited availability of technology providers, its techno-economic feasibility, negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain, price escalation due to high demand and low supplies, low SO2 concentration in ambient air and heavy burden on consumer due to increase in electricity prices etc”.",https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 16:09:11.491904

UK Export Finance (UKEF) has stepped in to support the development of a massive offshore wind farm in Taiwan, thereby unlocking new opportunities for British exporters in the fast-growing renewable energy market.

As part of the government’s broader economic growth agenda under the Plan for Change, UKEF is providing a €146 million Buyer Credit Guarantee. This funding will help bring 632 megawatts of clean energy capacity to life in the Taiwan Strait, enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

This isn't just about turbines in the water. The deal puts UK firms like Cadeler, CRP Subsea, Ordtek, and Cathie on the map for international contracts. These companies will supply highly specialized services and key components for the project, strengthening the UK’s renewable energy supply chain and creating high-value jobs across the country.

It also reinforces Britain’s ambition to become a true clean energy superpower, an idea that sits at the heart of the country’s modern Industrial Strategy.

Leading the charge is Ørsted, the Danish energy giant that has made one of the most dramatic pivots in the energy sector, moving away from fossil fuels to become one of the world’s most prominent renewable energy developers.

The wind farm is expected to reduce emissions by an estimated 1.1 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent annually. That’s a serious environmental win, not just for Taiwan, but for the planet.

This project isn’t happening in isolation either. It’s part of a global financing effort, with support from other export credit agencies in Denmark, Norway, South Korea, and Taiwan. This collaborative push underscores just how international the clean energy transition is.

Minister for Exports, Gareth Thomas, said:

""This shows how the Government is boosting exports in our key growth sectors and supporting jobs across the country as part of our Plan for Change.""

""This investment will enable British innovation in renewable technology to scale up Taiwan’s clean energy transition and follows our modern Industrial Strategy, which provides up to £13 billion of direct lending for UKEF to help businesses to export.""

Trond Westlie, Group CFO of Ørsted, said:

""We’ve received very strong support from both international and local banks and export credit agencies for the project financing of Greater Changhua 2. This shows that there is a healthy appetite for premium assets with robust contractual structures, and it’s a clear sign that we’re working diligently to deliver on our divestment and partnerships programme.""

Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill has ended the EV handout, much to the dismay of Elon Musk, Ford, and others trying to sell EVs to Americans who have not embraced the technology.

Business Insider reports that the race is on for automakers to sell as many EVs as possible before the $7,500 tax credit, a crucial incentive for buyers, comes to an end on September 30. President Donald Trump’s recently passed Big Beautiful Bill is set to eliminate this subsidy, which has played a significant role in making EVs more attractive to consumers.

In response to the looming deadline, Tesla and Ford are taking proactive measures to capitalize on the last-minute surge in demand. Tesla’s website prominently features a banner warning potential buyers about the expiring tax credit and urging them to take delivery by the end of September. Elon Musk’s EV giant is also reportedly sending out emails to would-be customers, emphasizing the importance of completing their purchases before the deadline to qualify for the $7,500 discount.

Analysts have cautioned that the removal of the tax credit, along with other measures in Trump’s bill targeting handouts for renewable energy, will lead to higher EV prices and significantly impact Tesla’s bottom line. However, Elon Musk has argued that the elimination of these incentives will disproportionately affect the company’s rivals and ultimately boost Tesla’s position in the long run, despite many of its vehicles currently benefiting from the tax credit.

Musk has become a vocal critic of the Big Beautiful Bill, claiming that it will increase the federal deficit and give China an advantage in the clean energy race. He has continually claimed that his rabid opposition of the bill and his personal betrayal of President Trump are not driven by the elimination of subsidies for EVs, but Trump disagrees.

In a post to Truth Social about Musk’s plan to launch a new political party, Trump commented on the Tesla CEO’s love of government money:

The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats, who have lost their confidence and their minds! Republicans, on the other hand, are a smooth running “machine,” that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country. It is a Great Bill but, unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time. I have been strongly opposed to that from the very beginning. People are now allowed to buy whatever they want — Gasoline Powered, Hybrids (which are doing very well), or New Technologies as they come about — No more EV Mandate. I have campaigned on this for two years and, quite honestly, when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate — It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had. He said he had no problems with that — I was very surprised!

Ford, meanwhile, is also taking steps to encourage buyers to act quickly. The automaker has extended its offer of a complimentary home EV charger and installation from July 8th to September 30th, coinciding with the tax credit’s expiration date. Stacey Ferreira, Ford’s head of sales strategy in the US, told Business Insider, “There’s never a better time to buy an EV than now,” citing the various incentives currently available in the marketplace.

Ferreira noted that Ford has introduced a “zero-zero-zero” incentive program, which includes zero down payment, zero payments for the first 90 days, and 0 percent interest for the first 48 months on select models. This program replaces an earlier incentive that offered employee discounts to all customers. Ferreira also pointed out that in other markets where tax credits have been phased out, there tends to be a spike in interest from consumers who haven’t yet made the switch to EVs but want to take advantage of the incentives before they disappear.

“U.S. EPA should object to this permit because it’s inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and the region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone,” Kerri Gefeke, associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “Numerous studies show that residents living near Gary Works already suffer from some of the highest rates of air pollution in the nation — resulting in high rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases.”

The petition, submitted on July 3, claims the permit “fails to include many basic provisions of the Clean Air Act,” according to a Thursday news release from the Environmental Law and Policy Center. The petition alleges that the permit renewal is missing clear and enforceable monitoring, testing and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements, according to the news release.

r

“Permitting decisions are made based on an applicant’s ability to demonstrate compliance with applicable state and federal rules and regulations, including the Clean Air Act,” IDEM responded in a Thursday statement. “The U.S. Steel Gary Works Part 70 Operating Permit was issued following an EPA review and comment period.”

U.S. Steel also responded to the petition in a Thursday statement.

“Environmental stewardship is a core value at U.S. Steel, and we remain committed to the safety of our communities as do our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees,” a spokesperson said in an email.

In addition to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, two regional groups participated in the petition: Gary Advocates for Responsible Development and Just Transition Northwest Indiana.

In the petition, the organizations argue that IDEM disregarded concerns from the EPA and commenters during the public comment period. The petition asks for the EPA to object to the renewal permit.

The petition asks IDEM to revise the renewal permit to include supplemental monitoring for various emission limits, and include contents of the continuous compliance plan and corrective action plan, among others.

Petitioners also want IDEM to provide detailed rationales in the renewal permit record about the adequacy of monitoring requirements to assure compliance, according to petition documents.

An October report from Industrious Labs found that most residents in Gary are in the top 10% of U.S. residents most at-risk for developing asthma and at-risk of low life expectancy.

Earlier this year, the American Lung Association gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm births and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. The organization also found that particle pollution can cause lung cancer.

In a statement Thursday, GARD President Dorreen Carey mentioned how Gary residents have suffered from air pollution, saying that upgrades in pollution monitoring are required to ensure public health is protected.

“EPA must object to this deficient IDEM permit renewal and require revisions to the air monitoring methodology that will include updated and supplemental monitoring of emissions and opacity limits to ensure permit compliance and current and ongoing protection of Gary residents’ health and environment,” Carey said.

Susan Thomas, director of policy and press for Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said the permit is missing “the most basic environmental management provisions,” including monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

“This dangerous situation is totally unacceptable and unprecedented, opening the door to an ‘anything goes’ model for industry pollution standards in a community that has historically been pushed to the brink,” Thomas said in a statement. “Access to clean air, safe water and healthy soil is a fundamental human right, one that Gary, and every community, deserves without compromise.”

A Smarter Solar Future Both the Build Public Renewables Act and the Big Beautiful Bill point toward a more electrified, climate-conscious future, but they take different paths.","The sun may be shining on solar in New York today, but what about tomorrow?

With a web of federal incentives and ambitious state goals, New York has become one of the top states for residential solar. But as the landmark federal Inflation Reduction Act begins to wind down key tax credits after 2025, and as New York’s own programs face funding and policy changes, many homeowners are asking: What’s next for solar in the Empire State?

In this article, we’ll break down what New York homeowners need to know about the changing solar landscape, what’s already in place, and what might be coming next. If you’re thinking about going solar—or wondering how recent policies affect your existing system—this is the time to pay attention.

The Federal Clock Is Ticking

Let’s start with the most pressing deadline: the 30% federal solar tax credit, officially called the Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D).

This credit, which allows homeowners to deduct 30% of their total solar installation cost from their federal taxes, was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. But it won’t last forever. Unless Congress acts again, this incentive will drop to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, and expire altogether by 2035.

But here’s the real catch: In order to qualify for the full 30% credit, your system must be installed and turned on by December 31, 2025.

That’s why solar providers across the country—including local companies like New York Electric & Solar, are encouraging homeowners to plan their projects now, not later. As the deadline gets closer, demand is expected to surge, leading to potential delays in permitting, utility approvals, and equipment availability.

What the Big Beautiful Bill Did (and Didn’t Do)

In July 2025, the U.S. Congress passed what’s officially known as H.R. 1 — but what many in the media have dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill.” This sweeping piece of federal legislation made major changes to tax policy, energy funding, and climate programs nationwide. For homeowners interested in going solar, it’s especially important to understand what this bill did — and what it didn’t do.

One of the most significant impacts of the Big Beautiful Bill was its rollback of clean energy tax credits that had previously been expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act. This includes a phase-out of the 30% Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit (Section 25D) — the credit that homeowners use to reduce the cost of installing solar panels. Under the new federal law, the credit is set to expire after December 31, 2025, unless further action is taken. For many homeowners, this makes 2025 the final window to access the full federal incentive.

In addition to cutting tax credits, the bill introduced stricter requirements for solar equipment sourcing — including new rules around foreign entities and domestic content. While these changes aim to boost American manufacturing, they also add complexity for solar installers and may impact equipment availability or pricing.

What the Big Beautiful Bill did not do, however, is directly affect New York State’s climate legislation, including the much-discussed Build Public Renewables Act, which passed at the state level in 2023.

What New York’s Build Public Renewables Act Actually Covers

Before the Big Beautiful Bill, New York passed its own landmark climate legislation: the Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA). Signed into law in 2023, this bill expanded the authority of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop, build, and operate large-scale renewable energy projects across the state.

The BPRA was a major win for public power advocates, particularly in terms of equity. It gave NYPA the green light to build clean energy infrastructure in underserved communities, ensuring a more just transition to renewable energy. It also created pathways for union jobs and emphasized long-term decarbonization of the state’s power grid.

But here’s the key point for homeowners: the Build Public Renewables Act does not provide new financial incentives for residential solar. It focuses primarily on utility-scale and community-level clean energy. While it strengthens the grid and supports statewide sustainability goals, it doesn’t lower out-of-pocket costs for individual families looking to install solar panels on their rooftops.

So Where Does That Leave Homeowners?

The combination of these two bills; one federal, one state, paints a clear picture:

New York’s Build Public Renewables Act is a long-term infrastructure strategy that strengthens the role of public power but doesn’t provide direct financial help for homeowners.

The federal Big Beautiful Bill (H.R. 1), on the other hand, reduces or removes the tax incentives that homeowners have relied on to make solar affordable.

That’s why, for New Yorkers thinking about going solar, 2025 is a crucial year. To lock in the 30% federal tax credit, your system must be fully installed and connected to the grid by December 31, 2025 — no exceptions.

Start with a free consultation

Make sure your system is installed and interconnected by the end of the year.

Secure your 30% federal tax credit before it’s gone.

And remember, while New York’s commitment to clean energy remains strong, there’s no replacement on the books yet for the federal residential credit that’s set to expire. If you wait until 2026, you may be paying significantly more out of pocket.

A Smarter Solar Future

Both the Build Public Renewables Act and the Big Beautiful Bill point toward a more electrified, climate-conscious future, but they take different paths. New York is investing in public infrastructure. The federal government is shifting focus toward domestic manufacturing and energy security. But for homeowners, it’s clear: 2025 is your moment.

As Inside EVs reported, Ionity announced it will begin rolling out new ultra-fast chargers across Europe in the second half of 2025. These chargers will be capable of adding up to 186 miles of range in under eight minutes, making road trips and daily commutes much more convenient for EV drivers.

Although EVs available in today’s European market can’t tap into this level of power yet, this upgrade lays the groundwork for the next generation of EVs. The system is also designed to be more efficient overall, sharing power between vehicles when multiple cars are plugged into the same station.

Faster charging means less time waiting at the charging station and more time living. Whether commuting, running errands, driving for rideshare services, or taking a family road trip, shorter charging stops reduce downtime, ease scheduling stress, and can help shave money off travel costs.

With less time spent charging, EV ownership becomes even more practical and accessible.

On a broader scale, the faster flow of traffic at charging stations can help cut congestion at these stations and make the act of owning and driving an EV that much more of a no-brainer for drivers. That will lead to less tailpipe pollution, especially in cities, and roughly halve the total pollution per mile driven, according to MIT.

By speeding up the turnover at charging spots, this shift can bring cleaner air, quieter streets, and a healthier planet for everyone.

Some companies are also factoring charging infrastructure into their cars’ software. As The EV Report noted on LinkedIn, Audi’s route planner can “streamline the search for charging stations.”

When you pair faster EV charging with solar power at home, the benefits add up even more. By powering your car with energy from rooftop panels, you can significantly reduce your electricity bills and make an especially meaningful impact on the environment. EnergySage allows you to compare quotes from trusted installers and save thousands on solar installations.

Ionity CEO Jeroen van Tilburg said in the press release that the rollout represents “another key milestone in our mission to deliver ultra‑fast, convenient charging at scale for EV drivers across Europe.”",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EuropeEV-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:56.891023

I never got there, being a workaholic. I was mainly a Cairo guy during my nearly 4 years off and on in that country.

So I didn’t know anything about Ras Gareb, about a hundred miles north of Hurghada on the Red Sea, and more specifically on the latter’s Gulf of El Zayt. The same Gustave Eiffel who designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris was hired by Ottoman viceroy Khedive Ismail in 1871 to design a lighthouse at Ras Gareb. Ras Gareb was only founded as a town in 1932, because there is an oil field in the area. It is a small town, probably with a population of less than 50,000. So this part of Egypt is already entangled in modernism — the lighthouse was for Red Sea steamship traffic.

Now, it is now the site of the largest wind farm on the African continent, and a complex of two wind farms there now generates nearly a gigawatt (914 megawatts) of power, enough to provide electricity to 1.1 million Egyptian households!

Back in the 1950s, when Egypt wanted to build an Aswan Dam, it initially went to the US because of its wealth and expertise. When Washington tried to dominate Egypt and cut it off from its Eastern European markets, Cairo rebelled and turned to the Soviet Union to finish the dam.

But now the United States and Russia aren’t in the picture for this enormous infrastructure project. Japan and France are.

Toyota Tsusho built Gulf of Suez Wind Farm I near Ras Gareb in 2019, with a a power generation capacity of 262.5 megawatts.

The company then partnered with its partially owned subsidiary, Japan’s Eurus Energy, which is also partly owned by TEPCO; with France’s Engie S.A., and with Egypt’s Orascom Construction PLC to create a truly vast wind farm with really huge turbines, the Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II.

And now, ESI Africa reports the Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II is fully operational, having added 150 megawatts in capacity in March. It is therefore putting out 654 megawatts.

The new wind farm cost $790 million, having begun construction in 2023. The financing was handled by Japanese banks, a French one, and by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. A Japanese concern covered the insurance. The speed with which Toyota Tsusho and its partners erected this massive project is just incredible, and it underlines why wind and solar are the future. The installation has 104 turbines. Twenty of them are so gigantic that they each put out 7.5 megawatts. The other 84 aren’t chopped liver, either, each with a 6 megawatt nameplate capacity.

Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II is now fully connected to the Egyptian grid. Along with Wind Farm I at the same location t will power as many households as there are in the entire state of Kansas. It is a 25-year contract and Japan will repatriate profits from it.

Trump’s United States will not. Of wind power, Trump said, “We’re not going to be having that.”

Egypt wants 42% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, and this new large Japanese-built wind complex will help it meet that (overly modest) goal.

“Suez Wind,” Digital, Dream / Dreamland v3 / Clip2Comic, 2025

Rendering of the NuScale VOYGR SMR power plant approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.

The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.

“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”

Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.

In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”

The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.

But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.

In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.

In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.

Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.

Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.

“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”

But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.

“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”

Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.

“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.

Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.

Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”

The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.

The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.

The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.

“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”

Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.

‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.

Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?

“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”

Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.

“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”

Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.

“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”",https://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nuscale-Nucllear-Power-Plant.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 14:07:47.045118

When congressional Republicans decided to cut some Biden-era energy subsidies to help fund their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, they could have pruned wasteful subsidies while sparing the rest. Instead, they did the reverse. Americans will pay the price with higher costs for dirtier energy.

The nearly 900-page bill that President Donald Trump signed on July 4, slashes incentives for wind and solar energy, batteries, electric cars and home efficiency while expanding subsidies for fossil fuels and biofuels. That will leave Americans burning more fossil fuels despite strong public and scientific support for shifting to renewable energy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which energy technologies could rapidly cut emissions or need a financial boost to become viable from those that are already profitable but harm the environment. Unfortunately, the Republican bill favors the latter while stifling the former.

Cuts to renewable electricity: Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, provide over 90 percent of the new electricity added nationally and around the world in recent years. Natural gas turbines are in short supply, and there are long lead times to build nuclear power plants. Wind and solar energy projects — with batteries to store excess power until it’s needed — offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power. Recent technological breakthroughs put geothermal power on the verge of rapid growth.

However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It accelerates the phaseout of tax credits for factories that manufacture equipment needed for renewable energy and electric vehicles. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that had been stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Efforts to build new wind and solar farms will be hit even harder. To receive any tax credits, those projects will need to commence construction by mid-2026 or come online by the end of 2027. The act preserves a slower timeline for phasing out subsidies for nuclear, geothermal and hydrogen projects, which take far longer to build than wind and solar farms.

However, even projects that could be built soon enough will struggle to comply with the bill’s restrictions on using Chinese-made components. Tax law experts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible. For example, even American-made solar panels may rely on components sourced from China or Chinese-owned companies.

Princeton University professor Jesse Jenkins estimates that the bill will mean wind and solar power generate 820 fewer terawatt-hours in 2035 than under previous policies. That’s more power than all U.S. coal-fired power plants generated in 2023.

That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who is backed by the oil and gas industry.

Electric cars and efficiency: Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The quickest phaseout comes for tax credits for electric vehicles, which will end on Sept. 30. And since the bill eliminates fines on car companies that fail to meet fuel economy standards, other new cars are likely to guzzle more gas.

Tax credits for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows and energy audits will end at the end of 2025. Homeowners will also lose tax credits for installing solar panels at the end of the year, seven years earlier than under the previous law.

The bill also rescinds funding that would have helped cut diesel emissions and finance clean energy projects in underserved communities.

Support for biofuels and fossil fuels: Biofuels and fossil fuels fared far better under the bill. Tens of billions of dollars will be spent to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the effects of biofuels on land use.

Meanwhile, the bill opens more federal lands and waters to leasing for oil and gas drilling and coal mining. It also slashes the royalties that companies pay to the federal government for fuels extracted from publicly owned land. And a new tax credit will subsidize metallurgical coal, which is mainly exported to steelmakers overseas.

The bill also increases subsidies for using captured carbon dioxide to extract more oil and gas from the ground. That makes it less likely that captured emissions will only be sequestered to combat climate change.

The result: With fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects that the law will increase household energy costs by more than $280 per year by 2035 above what they would have been without the bill. The extra fossil fuel-burning will negate 470 million tons of anticipated emissions reductions that year, a 7 percent bump.

The bill will also leave America’s clean energy transition further behind China, which is deploying more solar and wind power and electric vehicles than the rest of the world combined.

No one expected President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both chambers of Congress, even though many of its projects were in Republican-voting districts. Still, pairing cuts to clean energy with support for fossil fuels makes Trump’s bill uniquely harmful to the world’s climate and to Americans’ wallets.

President Trump is unapologetic that his energy policy is unconstrained by the greenhouse gas emissions profile of the energy sector.
The Gambit for Dominance Energy dominance isn’t just a slogan.
The current interpretation of energy dominance also leaves out US leadership in clean energy, which might not be the best approach in the long run.","While President Trump’s call for energy dominance has historical precedent, what it means for America remains loosely defined.

On the first day of his presidency, President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency, pledging an aggressive push for energy dominance. His action builds on the goal of energy independence that was prevalent since the 1970s oil crisis, but now the ambition goes beyond freeing the United States from foreign oil by leveraging US energy abundance as a strategic asset.

Yet for all the rhetoric, the concept remains loosely defined. Going a step beyond mere self-sufficiency, the administration wants energy to be reliable, affordable, and abundant—and domestically-sourced wherever possible. The following pillars of energy abundance emerge: solidifying American leadership in fossil fuel production and exports, rejuvenating the American nuclear and coal industries, a deregulatory push, securing supply chains, and abandoning the federal pursuit of decarbonization.

These priorities aim toward reducing American dependency on foreign imports, growing the economy, and addressing the rising national debt and budget imbalances.

Dominant in What?

Trump’s vision of energy dominance centers on American strengths: oil, gas, coal, and nuclear. In stark contrast to the 1970s, today, the United States shapes international energy markets as a net exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) and as a prominent producer of liquids —crude oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). According to the Texas Oil and Gas Association, in 2024, the U.S. generated as much crude oil and NGLs as it consumed from a volumetric standpoint.

In this area, the United States has achieved its energy independence goals. American producers operate in a robust cost environment: many shale fields remain profitable at oil prices near $70/barrel, enabling their flexibility and competitiveness throughout production cycles. Geopolitically, American LNG exports have undercut Russia’s energy revenues and strengthened its ties with the EU, Japan, South Korea, China, and Turkey, which are major purchasers of American LNG.

Deregulation is another pillar of energy dominance. By lifting permitting hurdles and rolling back environmental regulations, the administration’s goal is to halt the early retirement of coal plants, and accelerate the building of pipeline, other LNG infrastructure, and refining projects. In practice, this involves revisiting aspects of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and easing carbon-capture mandates. This is likely to benefit the coal industry most of all.

Energy dominance also involves resilient supply chains, particularly for critical minerals like lithium, graphite, and rare earths. With China currently dominating the production and processing of these materials, the United States has begun “friend-shoring” (relocating processing to allied nations or domestically) to control the entire energy supply chain from extraction to manufacturing.

Not an “All of the Above” Solution

The administration focuses on energy sources that deliver dispatchable, “always-on” electricity. Besides fossil fuels, conventional nuclear energy, alongside small modular nuclear reactors, is a scalable baseload solution. If the United States successfully exports its domestic nuclear designs, it will forge long-lasting alliances with the recipients of these technologies. These relationships could span a hundred years due to the nuclear plants’ longevity. Support for nuclear power is further fueled by the urgent energy needs of the data center industry. Energy dominance will help the United States maintain its current leadership in the AI race, a position that is constantly challenged by China.

Notably, however, wind and solar have been sidelined in the energy dominance narrative. The first Secretarial Order by Chris Wright, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, does not address these technologies at all. Despite excellent wind and solar resources in the United States, there has been little federal push to compete with China in renewable hardware or electric vehicle battery supply chains. The United States seems to be at peace with letting China lead the clean energy transition.

President Trump is unapologetic that his energy policy is unconstrained by the greenhouse gas emissions profile of the energy sector. This is a clear break from Joe Biden’s ambitious targets for solar and wind sectors; for example, the prior administration’s thirty gigawatts (GW) target for offshore wind installed capacity by 2030 is now clearly unachievable.

The Gambit for Dominance

Energy dominance isn’t just a slogan. It is a deliberate, multi-layered strategy akin to an industrial policy that emphasizes US market-share expansion and supply chain control. Energy is not merely a commodity, but also a tool of economic statecraft.

True dominance requires long-term investments, sustained international partnerships, a stable business environment with high amounts of certainty in government policy, continued technological leadership, and a non-confrontational trade policy that builds alliances. The United States may gain leverage abroad and cheaper fuel at home, but its current approach increases the risks of isolation and trade conflicts.

Moreover, energy dominance might not mix well with trade tariffs. For example, the US and Canadian electric grids are integrated, and the tariffs might create issues shifting energy across the border.

Still, for now, the US seems to hold a strong hand. It has access to cheap, abundant hydrocarbons and is home to the largest nuclear power plant fleet in the world. Yet energy dominance is not a destination—it is a statement of policy priorities that must continuously adapt to shifting markets and alliances. The current interpretation of energy dominance also leaves out US leadership in clean energy, which might not be the best approach in the long run.

FAQ 1.Do Mercedes EQ Models Qualify For The Federal EV Tax Credit?
Some Mercedes EQ models, like the U.S.-assembled EQB SUV, may qualify for federal EV tax credits.
4.How Do I Claim The EV Tax Credit For A Mercedes EQ Vehicle?","So, you’re thinking about making the jump into a Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle—maybe the sleek EQS Sedan, the versatile EQB SUV, or something new in the pipeline. But before you plug in and hit the road, let’s talk about one of the most satisfying parts of going electric:

The EV tax credit. It’s like getting rewarded for being both eco-conscious and style-savvy. But the truth is, the world of tax credits for Mercedes-Benz EQ models isn’t just plug-and-play. There are eligibility criteria, evolving legislation, and a few surprises along the way.

Eligibility Criteria For EV Tax Credits

First things first—let’s talk federal. The Federal EV Tax Credit offers up to $7,500 off your tax bill if you buy a qualified clean vehicle. But not every electric model qualifies. The rules now consider where the car is assembled, where battery components come from, and even where the minerals are sourced.

And here’s the kicker: the vehicle needs to be new, have a price under certain caps (around $80,000 for SUVs), and you—the buyer—must meet income limits. These rules evolved after the Inflation Reduction Act, so what worked in 2023 may not apply now in 2025.

Specific Requirements For Mercedes EQ Models

So where does that leave our beloved Mercedes-Benz EV models? Well, some do qualify, some don’t—at least not for the full credit. For example, the U.S.-assembled EQB SUV may qualify for partial credit depending on the trim and final assembly location. Meanwhile, the German-made EQS Sedan typically doesn’t qualify for federal incentives, though it still shines with national offers and dealer finance specials.

The best way to check? Head to the dealership’s finance center or use IRS tools to confirm current qualification status by Mercedes-Benz model and VIN.

Differentiating Between EVs And PHEVs

This is where things get tricky. Not all electric vehicles are fully electric. Some are PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). That matters. PHEVs like the upcoming 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid can qualify for reduced federal tax credits—based on battery size and electric-only range.

So while a hybrid electric vehicle might not be as “clean” as a full EV, it can still put some cash back in your pocket if it meets IRS benchmarks.

Available Tax Credits For Mercedes EQ Models

List of Eligible Mercedes EQ Models

As of June 2025, here’s a quick look at how Mercedes-Benz EQ models align with tax credits:

EQB SUV: May qualify (assembled in the U.S. in some cases)

EQS Sedan: Generally doesn’t qualify for federal, but special offers often available

GLC Plug-in Hybrid (new model): Expected to receive partial credit

Certified pre-owned Mercedes-Benz EV models: Eligible for used EV tax credit (details below)

Keep in mind that vehicle specials may apply regardless of federal incentives. You can often find shopping tools, finance specials, and lease return deals to stack savings.

Insights On The Mercedes-Benz EQ Lineup

The Mercedes EQ vehicle lineup is growing fast. From the flagship EQS Sedan with its hyper-luxury interior to the family-ready EQB SUV, there’s an electric car for nearly every lifestyle. These vehicles feature cutting-edge EQ Technology, built-in DC fast charging support, and tech-heavy dashboards that feel straight out of 2030.

And yes, even if a model doesn’t qualify for a tax credit, it’s hard to ignore the value of driving a luxury electric vehicle that blends performance, Mercedes-Benz S-Class comfort, and futuristic design.

How To Claim The Federal Tax Credit

Steps to Applying for the Tax Credit

If you’re buying an eligible new Mercedes-Benz EV, claiming the EV tax credit is pretty straightforward:

Confirm vehicle eligibility: Verify the model and trim qualify on the IRS website.

File IRS Form 8936: You’ll need this form when doing your taxes.

Use your Payment Calculator: Work with the finance center to estimate post-credit pricing.

Retain documents: Purchase agreement, VIN, and dealership verification of tax credit eligibility.

Just remember: this is a tax credit, not a rebate. It reduces your owed federal tax—not the vehicle’s sticker price.

Required Documentation And Forms

In most cases, you’ll need:

IRS Form 8936 (Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit)

Purchase agreement with VIN

Dealership’s documentation showing Mercedes-Benz qualify status for the selected model

If the vehicle qualifies, your tax return will reflect the full or partial credit as a deduction on what you owe Uncle Sam.

Understanding Pre-Owned EV Tax Credits

Federal Pre-Owned EV Tax Credit Overview

Buying used? There’s still good news. A federal pre-owned EV tax credit of up to $4,000 is now available. This applies to certified pre-owned vehicles or even pre-owned specials under $25,000—great news if you’re eyeing a slightly older EQ model.

But again, you must buy from a licensed dealer, and the vehicle must be at least two model years old.

Criteria For Pre-Owned Mercedes EQ Models

To qualify for the used EV credit, the pre-owned Mercedes-Benz must:

Be from the Mercedes-Benz EQ family (like a 2022 EQB or EQS)

Be priced under $25,000

Not have been sold as a credit-claimed vehicle before

Be used by the buyer (not resold immediately)

Certified dealerships like Autonation Inc often stock qualifying models, and they’ll help you navigate the finance application and related paperwork.

Maximizing Tax Credit Benefits

Leveraging Dealer Advice and Resources

Dealers are your secret weapon here. Many Mercedes-Benz retailers offer shopping tools, calculators, and express service for quick inspections and EV evaluations. Ask about Mercedes-Benz Partner Programs that may offer additional savings or employer discounts.

Oh—and don’t skip the parts specials if you’re personalizing your new EQ ride.

Strategies For Maximizing Savings

Want to stack your savings? Try this:

Start with a new vehicle special or pre-owned vehicle special

Apply your tax credit at tax time

Use dealer finance specials to lower your APR

Explore national offers and Mercedes-Benz certified vehicles for extra perks

Even if the federal credit doesn’t fully apply, many EQ models are supported by state-level incentives and Electrify America charging promotions. Combined, these can make your first year of ownership surprisingly cost-effective.

Considerations For New EV Technologies

Innovations in 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid

The 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid is particularly exciting. It’s a hybrid electric vehicle that blends traditional gasoline power with an extended electric-only range—ideal if you’re transitioning from gas to electric. Plus, it’s expected to meet requirements for partial EV credits, making it a sweet middle ground.

It also features upgraded DC fast charging, real-time battery monitoring, and next-gen EQ Technology that rivals even full EVs in driving smoothness and power delivery.

Benefits Of Adopting New Technologies

Let’s be honest—early adopters get perks. Beyond the tax credit, you’re getting:

Lower maintenance vs. gas cars

Quiet, ultra-smooth rides

Access to priority parking and HOV lanes in many cities

Support from Mercedes-Benz’s expanding new inventory of service-friendly EVs

Plus, innovations in electric cars work best when adopted early—like over-the-air updates and smart charging networks.

Broader Context Of Qualified Clean Vehicle Tax Credits

Overview of Other Eligible Manufacturers and Models

Mercedes isn’t alone in the game. Other eligible electric vehicle makers include Ford (F-150 Lightning), Tesla (Model Y), and Rivian. However, few match the luxury and refinement of a Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle—especially in interior design and brand status.

So while others qualify, driving a Mercedes EQ vehicle is about more than credits. It’s about lifestyle, confidence, and long-term vision.

Insights From Dealership Locations

Whether you’re browsing in-person or online, dealership support is everything. The Mercedes-Benz Finance Center can:

Check current recall information

Confirm pre-owned vehicle specials

Help submit your finance application

Navigate new Mercedes-Benz inventory vs. certified pre-owned inventory

Some even offer lease return programs with flexible upgrade options—perfect if you’re planning to switch from gas to electric over time.

Final Thoughts

Here’s the truth: EV tax credits aren’t one-size-fits-all. But if you’re strategic, they can tip the scales in favor of a smarter, cleaner investment. Whether it’s a new Mercedes-Benz EV, a pre-owned Mercedes-Benz, or an upcoming hybrid electric vehicle, the key is knowing your options.

And when you pair all that tech and style with a little money back at tax time? That’s what I call a win.

Used EV prices fell nearly 32% in 2024 from 2023, almost 10 times the drop in used gas-powered car prices, according to iSeeCars.com, an automotive research site.

Last year, the average used EV cost around $30,900, in line with the average used gas car, even though a new EV sells for $17,300 more than a comparable gas model on average.

Discounts have drawn in buyers like Christopher Andrzejczak, a systems engineer from Orlando, Fla., who has owned five EVs over the past decade. Last year, he picked up a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,000 miles on it for $36,000—less than half of its sticker price.

That price included an extended warranty and several upgrades like tinted windows that the previous owner had paid for.

Deals on used EVs are especially pronounced because EVs lose value faster than gas-powered cars once they drive off the lot. The depreciation often reflects concerns about battery life and longevity. Replacing a battery out of warranty is costly but uncommon. New technology could quickly make a used EV antiquated. The vehicles also require specialized parts and labor that make them more expensive to repair when something goes wrong.

“I was like, You know what? I’m willing to take a risk on that,” Andrzejczak said. The previous owner “probably took a terrible depreciation hit.”

In the new-car market, higher sticker prices and the fast pace of depreciation can make it hard for many car shoppers to justify going green.

New electric vehicles cost about $800 more a year to own than gas-powered cars when factoring in fuel, maintenance, insurance and fees. But removing the cost of depreciation results in a saving of more than $900 annually versus a gas car, according to an analysis of AAA data. EVs have lower fuel and maintenance costs, but cost more to insure.

In 2024, charging an EV at home worked out to the equivalent of about $1.41 a gallon of gas, according to the Energy Department. That is less than half of what most drivers paid at the pump last year.

EV owners spend roughly half as much on upkeep and repairs compared with gas-car drivers, according to Consumer Reports. Over the life of the car, that adds up to about $4,600 in maintenance costs for an EV compared with $9,200 for a traditional one.

Used cars also don’t depreciate as quickly. In January, Andrzejczak purchased a used 2021 Audi E-Tron Prestige for $27,000, with the intent to get ahead of tariffs and eventually gift it to his teenage son. When his son made it clear he wasn’t interested in March, Andrzejczak sold the car to Carvana for $26,000.

“It’s like I borrowed it for a few months for $1,000,” he said.

Jason Wallace, who owns Electrified Autos, a used EV dealership in Joplin, Mo., says more buyers are realizing they can save money by making the switch to electric. In an economy pinched by years of inflation and high interest rates, he said, “that’s all that matters to them.”

The used-car dealership has been in Wallace’s family since 1975 when his grandfather opened it, but Wallace and his brother made the decision to focus exclusively on selling electric vehicles last year. So far, it has paid off.

“There’s demand for EVs at the right price,” he said. “Not everyone is going to spend $60,000 on a car but they will look harder when it’s $20,000 or less, and we have no problem selling those.”

Another reason for the rush is looming changes in EV policy. A $4,000 federal tax credit for used EVs is set to expire at the end of September as a result of the new tax law passed earlier this month. The $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, which made new models more affordable and helped keep prices down in the used market, is also expiring at the same time.

Eli Cook decided to buy an electric vehicle after researching gas prices in the Bay Area. He and his wife, both recent college graduates, plan to move there from Missouri later this year for work. Expecting far higher gas prices in California than Missouri, the couple wanted something affordable and efficient. As newlyweds, they are determined to avoid going into debt.

They could have waited until after the move, but worried they would miss out on the tax credit. Last month, they paid $15,000 cash for a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The window sticker, Cook said, showed it had sold for nearly $40,000 four years earlier.

“It really seems like we’re buying the dip for used EVs right now,” he said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/13/1600x900/im-14903142_1752422224330_1752422278563.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:25.290696

Used EV sales topped 100,000 for the first time in the second quarter, according to industry-services business Cox Automotive. It is a rare bright spot for the EV industry, which is contending with lackluster demand and the looming elimination of federal tax credits. Sales for new EVs fell in each of the last three months.

What buyers are finding in the used market is deals. Used EV prices fell nearly 32% in 2024 from 2023, almost 10 times the drop in used gas-powered car prices, according to iSeeCars.com, an automotive research site.

Last year, the average used EV cost around $30,900, in line with the average used gas car, even though a new EV sells for $17,300 more than a comparable gas model on average.

Discounts have drawn in buyers like Christopher Andrzejczak, a systems engineer from Orlando, Fla., who has owned five EVs over the past decade. Last year, he picked up a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,000 miles on it for $36,000—less than half of its sticker price.

That price included an extended warranty and several upgrades like tinted windows that the previous owner had paid for.

Deals on used EVs are especially pronounced because EVs lose value faster than gas-powered cars once they drive off the lot. The depreciation often reflects concerns about battery life and longevity. Replacing a battery out of warranty is costly but uncommon. New technology could quickly make a used EV antiquated. The vehicles also require specialized parts and labor that make them more expensive to repair when something goes wrong.

EV owners spend roughly half as much on upkeep and repairs compared with gas-car drivers, according to Consumer Reports. Over the life of the car, that adds up to about $4,600 in maintenance costs for an EV compared with $9,200 for a traditional one.

Used cars also don’t depreciate as quickly. In January, Andrzejczak purchased a used 2021 Audi E-Tron Prestige for $27,000, with the intent to get ahead of tariffs and eventually gift it to his teenage son. When his son made it clear he wasn’t interested in March, Andrzejczak sold the car to Carvana for $26,000.

“It’s like I borrowed it for a few months for $1,000,” he said.

Jason Wallace, who owns Electrified Autos, a used EV dealership in Joplin, Mo., says more buyers are realizing they can save money by making the switch to electric. In an economy pinched by years of inflation and high interest rates, he said, “that’s all that matters to them.”

The used-car dealership has been in Wallace’s family since 1975 when his grandfather opened it, but Wallace and his brother made the decision to focus exclusively on selling electric vehicles last year. So far, it has paid off.

“There’s demand for EVs at the right price,” he said. “Not everyone is going to spend $60,000 on a car but they will look harder when it’s $20,000 or less, and we have no problem selling those.”

Another reason for the rush is looming changes in EV policy. A $4,000 federal tax credit for used EVs is set to expire at the end of September as a result of the new tax law passed earlier this month. The $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, which made new models more affordable and helped keep prices down in the used market, is also expiring at the same time.

Eli Cook decided to buy an electric vehicle after researching gas prices in the Bay Area. He and his wife, both recent college graduates, plan to move there from Missouri later this year for work. Expecting far higher gas prices in California than Missouri, the couple wanted something affordable and efficient. As newlyweds, they are determined to avoid going into debt.

They could have waited until after the move, but worried they would miss out on the tax credit. Last month, they paid $15,000 cash for a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The window sticker, Cook said, showed it had sold for nearly $40,000 four years earlier.

“It really seems like we’re buying the dip for used EVs right now,” he said.

The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.
“The technology has matured.” The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.
Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.
Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.","Ameren is looking to build a natural gas-fired power plant and the company’s first large lithium-ion battery facility on the Jefferson County site of its former coal-based Rush Island Energy Center, which closed last year after continuous Clean Air Act violations.

The St. Louis-based electric utility will call the complex the Big Hollow Energy Center, the company announced late last month. Collectively, the 800-megawatt gas plant and the 400-megawatt battery storage facility would roughly match the generating potential that Rush Island had, taking advantage of the site’s existing transmission capacity and access to the power grid.

“That was the idea,” said Ajay Arora, Ameren Missouri’s senior vice president and chief development officer. “The infrastructure is extremely valuable … certainly the transmission aspect of it.”

The proposed switch to gas at one of its former coal plant sites follows a familiar playbook for Ameren. The utility is also building an 800-megawatt gas plant — called the Castle Bluff Energy Center — for about $800 million at the former site of its smallest and oldest coal plant, the Meramec Energy Center in south St. Louis County, which closed at the end of 2022.

The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.

Ameren said it intends for the new facility to play a similar role, “as a reliable backup source of energy,” with the gas plant designed to provide power when demand peaks on cold winter days, hot summer afternoons, and to support the grid when renewable generation is unavailable.

Meanwhile, the project’s energy storage component would do much of the same. For instance, the batteries could be charged when cheap, excess energy is on the grid and then used when needed, in any weather conditions.

“Fully charged, the entire array could power thousands of homes for hours and help overall grid reliability, especially during times of peak energy needs,” Ameren said in its announcement.

While the site offers plenty of existing attributes, such as its readymade transmission access, Ameren said that the Rush Island building could not be retrofitted to accommodate the new projects, and that its demolition is already underway.

Ameren still needs approval from state utility regulators before proceeding with its Big Hollow proposal, which it hopes to receive by March. The company then aims to complete the project by 2028.

The utility said that the estimated cost of the project is currently confidential.

‘About time’ for battery storage

Ameren’s plans for the Rush Island site’s redevelopment have elicited some mixed reactions from energy experts — and raised questions about costs.

For example, the company’s push to build new generation and aid grid reliability comes as it says it faces a wave of demand from prospective developers of highly energy-intensive projects, like data centers.

Utilities are fielding similar requests nationwide, although Missouri has not yet seen the explosions in energy demand that so far have been concentrated in scattershot places across the map, such as Virginia, Texas and North Dakota.

Predicting if or when that wave of demand could materialize in Missouri is one challenge that now confronts regional utilities and state regulators, raising questions about how to shoulder costs of energy projects that largely cater to heavy users, and carrying risks of a possible “overbuild” that leaves customers on the hook for hefty investments.

“The question is what supply should be built and how do you pay for it?” said Ashok Gupta, a Kansas City-based energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

While the payment question will eventually be part of the regulatory review process for Ameren’s Big Hollow proposal, it is also being broadly examined and debated in separate cases before the Missouri Public Service Commission. For example, outside groups and watchdog agencies that police utility spending will soon weigh in on cases about how to serve large-load customers seeking power from the state’s biggest electric utilities: Ameren and Kansas City-based Evergy.

Federal energy policy whiplash out of Washington now “makes the calculus even harder” in determining what to build and when to build it, Gupta said, as tax credits for wind and solar projects are now set to lapse within a couple years — projects that represent the bulk of new power generation in the U.S.

But costs at Big Hollow could at least partially be reduced by federal tax credits for battery storage projects. Unlike the tax credits for wind and solar, those for battery storage projects were spared the widespread cuts contained in the massive spending bill passed by Congressional Republicans this month, and signed by President Donald Trump.

Some, like Gupta, cheered the battery portion of the proposed project.

“It’s about time,” said Gupta, noting that storage can nicely complement renewable energy and smooth out issues with intermittent generation, whenever solar or wind generation stops or slows. “It’s exciting, it’s necessary.”

Ameren said its battery investment aligns with industry trends and that it can learn from other utilities that adopted the technology earlier.

“A lot of our peer utilities are investing heavily in batteries,” said Arora, the Ameren senior vice president. “The technology has matured.”

The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.

Gas has had issues with reliability and affordability at times, particularly in the extreme weather conditions when peaker plants are needed, as illustrated during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when gas plants faltered and fuel prices skyrocketed.

And building gas plants, themselves, has become considerably more expensive in recent years, with costs tripling amid high demand and long waits for gas turbines, said John Ketchum, the CEO of NextEra Energy, a giant Florida-based utility, at recent energy conferences in March and June.

Gupta, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, questioned Ameren’s choice to pursue a simple-cycle gas plant — a less efficient alternative than combined-cycle gas plants, which recover exhaust heat and use it to generate additional power.

“You’re gonna burn all this gas. Let’s get as much energy as possible,” Gupta said.

Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.

Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.

“The lowest-cost resource is still energy efficiency,” said Gupta. “We should be doing hundreds if not thousands of megawatts of energy efficiency to keep energy affordable.”

Filling the void

The proposed next chapter for the site would mark the coda to Rush Island’s unique — and criminal — background. Between 2007 and 2010, Ameren illegally modified the plant’s generators near the end of their intended lifespan without obtaining permits — enabling them to produce more energy and emit more air pollutants, and sparking a decade-plus lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice.

The plant was one of a dwindling number of U.S. coal plants that did not have widely adopted pollution controls, called scrubbers, that remove sulfur dioxide, or SO2, from emissions. Ameren’s biggest coal plant, the Labadie Energy Center west of St. Louis, also lacks scrubbers and emits far more SO2 than any other U.S. coal plant.

A judge in the marathon legal case over the plant’s air pollution sought to have the company offset Rush Island’s illegal SO2 emissions by reducing Labadie’s emissions by an equal amount. But an appeals court scrapped that order, saying that Ameren was never given notice of an alleged Clean Air Act violation at Labadie — despite the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency had issued “Notices of Violation” to the company about that very issue at Labadie, years ago.

The company ultimately reached an agreement to pay $61 million for electric school buses and charging equipment, as well as the distribution of air purifiers to residential customers, prioritizing low-income households.

The new plans for the site bring potential relief to local leaders dealing with lost tax revenue from Rush Island’s closure. For instance, the Jefferson R-VII School District will see a budget reduction of $1.1 million in the upcoming school year, thanks to the plant’s retirement.

“It’s a tough number to look at,” said David Haug, the district superintendent.

But the site’s planned redevelopment figures to eventually bring the money back. And it would provide longer-term certainty and stability compared to Rush Island, with Haug saying it felt as if the “clock was ticking” throughout the aging plant’s later years, as both the facility and the school district’s finances faced an unclear future.

“It was certainly a good day when we became aware that this was official,” Haug said. “This is a big, long-term win for the district.”

ByDan Gearino for Inside Climate News

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on July 7 that he said will “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources” such as wind and solar.

But it’s not clear whether the order will have much of an effect other than to underscore the president’s antipathy for those power sources. Some observers speculate this action is fulfilling a promise to hardline conservative House members in order to win their votes last week for the massive budget reconciliation bill.

The order is titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.” It directs the Treasury department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits” as specified by the bill.

Related | Trump thinks 'windmills are killing our country'—yes, really

The legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, says that projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027. This is a rapid phaseout compared to the previous law that had a phaseout that was to begin in 2032.

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines. It also says the department must take prompt action to follow the bill’s new limits on tax credits going to entities with ties to China.

In addition, it says the Department of the Interior must revise any policies or practices that give solar and wind power preferential treatment compared to other energy sources.

The Treasury and Interior departments also must make reports within 45 days about how they are complying with the order.

Analysts, lawmakers and officials from renewable energy industry groups had mixed reactions about the significance of the order.

But they do not downplay the effects of the bill that has become law. It is a gutting of incentives from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that will reduce federal government support for renewable energy, electric vehicles and manufacturing of those products and related components. The result, according to reports from Rhodium Group, Princeton University’s REPEAT Project, the think tank Energy Innovation and the Clean Energy Buyers Association, is likely to be a decrease in U.S. jobs and an increase in electricity prices.

And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.

“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email. “To state the obvious, only Congress can change tax law—which, in fact, is what Congress did last week via the budgetary megabill.”

He expects little or no practical effect from the Interior department provision

“It is worth noting that, under the Federal Power Act, the government cannot favor one type of power generation over another,” he said. “Thus, the EO simply restates existing law in that regard.”

Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate for BloombergNEF, sees much greater potential for harm to the wind and solar industries.

“It’s a big deal, but how big a deal it is we don’t know,” he said.

He explained that the order is attempting to create uncertainty around the 2026 deadline, which is a crucial deadline for projects to have a smooth path to qualifying for tax credits.

“It could push a lot of projects out of eligibility or into such an uncertain state of eligibility that it becomes hard to build and finance them,” he said.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, offered this statement:

“This executive order appears to target long-standing and well-established tax standards that allow for realistic financing timelines for all sorts of energy projects—including solar, wind, carbon capture and hydrogen projects,” she said. “We will continue to make the case that business certainty, predictability, and even-handedness are bedrocks of federal policy that cannot be undone by the stroke of a pen. We expect the Treasury Department to follow the law.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois), who has a background running clean energy businesses, said the order is about helping the market for fossil fuels by harming competing sources of electricity.

“Donald Trump doesn’t hate renewable energy because it is clean,” he said in an email. “He hates it because it’s cheap. His latest executive orders are about making it harder for Americans to access cheap and reliable energy to ensure he keeps profits up for his friends in the fossil fuel industry.”

Taylor Rogers, an assistant press secretary for Trump, pushed back on concerns that the president’s actions would lead to higher energy prices.

“No one takes disingenuous cost concerns seriously from ‘clean energy’ groups that supported a $200 billion tax hike on the American people to fund the Green New Scam,” she said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill will continue to unleash America’s energy industry, dropping electricity costs that increased dramatically due to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.”

She listed the many aspects of the bill that increase oil and gas production and reduce regulations, which she said will cut costs for consumers.

Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.

The budget bill passed the House on Friday, 218-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. Several fiscally conservative House members initially balked at the spending levels in the bill, but most of them ended up voting for it after meeting with Trump.

Asked about how Trump had earned their votes, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told CNBC on Friday that the president had told members he would use executive powers to stop renewable energy sources from being able to use subsidies.

“A lot of these subsidies won’t remain in effect from here on out,” Norman said.

He posted on Facebook on Tuesday that the order was “a pledge [Trump] had made, and one he kept.”

He added, “I proudly support an all-of-the-above energy approach—ensuring coal, gas, nuclear, hydropower, and yes, responsibly advanced renewables can compete in an honest market. THIS is how you make energy policy work for everyday Americans, not special interests.”

It’s not much of a stretch to see a connection between Norman’s comment on CNBC and the executive order, said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that works to expand access to rooftop solar.

“I assume that this is the direct response to that promise,” he said.

He said it’s difficult to predict the ramifications of the order without knowing how federal agencies will choose to respond.

“It all depends on how Treasury interprets the guidance. It could be nothing. It could be a lot,” he said.

Brand believes the order’s intent was to increase uncertainty and discourage companies from using the tax credits, which it may succeed in doing even if it doesn’t lead to any substantive changes in the way the credits work.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1455382/story_image/AP23060767877666.jpg?1752268392,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:08.837595

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes.

This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews.","Multiple federal agencies have rolled out new rules for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, as the Trump administration aims to expedite environmental reviews.

However, environmental groups warn the changes could erode the act’s intended purpose and safeguards around government decision making.

NEPA was signed into law in 1970, requiring federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of proposed actions such as issuing development permits, adopting federal land management actions, building highways and publicly-owned facilities and more.

The latest agency changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to ensure “environmental reviews cannot be weaponized to stall the growth of the American economy or halt energy infrastructure construction,” according to a June 30 memo from the White House .

These reforms follow a withdrawal of the Council on Environmental Quality’s authority, as ordered by the executive order to increase domestic energy production. The council, which was created at the same time as NEPA, historically has created a default set of regulations for agencies to adopt or build upon.

In the spring, the council pulled back its authority and rescinded its regulations . While many agencies already had their own NEPA regulations, this wholly shifted the responsibility to individual federal departments.

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes. This includes the U.S. departments of agriculture, commerce, interior, energy, transportation and defense as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

While there are nuances to the rule changes proposed by each of these federal agencies, there are a few through-lines as the agencies comply with recent executive orders, laws and Supreme Court decisions.

This includes deadlines and page limits for environmental reviews meant to expedite NEPA processes and reduce costs, some of which were prescribed through the ​​Fiscal Responsibility Act’s BUILDER Act amendments under the Biden administration in 2023 .

Additional changes around what actions and effects are subject to review lean on the May Supreme Court ruling regarding the proposed 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway narrowed the scope of what environmental impacts an agency is required to analyze under NEPA.

In the case, the plaintiffs (Eagle County and five environmental groups) argued that the review of the railway failed to study downstream impacts such as how increased rail traffic would impact wildfire risk and impacts on water resources and other biological resources.

The Supreme Court ruled that NEPA was “purely procedural” and agencies don’t have to study these up and downstream impacts and put the onus on agencies to determine the scope of analysis required for projects.

Both the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior ‘s interim final rules indicate the changes will get back to NEPA’s procedural roots and make reviews “faster, more flexible and more efficient” as guided by this court decision and other recent regulations and directives including Trump’s domestic energy executive orders, which gave guidance to expedite and simply NEPA processes.

One thing the Department of Agriculture is proposing to increase efficiency is to issue a uniform set of procedures for all agencies under it, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency and four more. The interim rule proposes rescinding all the individual regulations previously held by these agencies.

In a statement , Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the permitting process “has been abused for decades to block affordable, reliable energy production, delay critical infrastructure projects and stunt America’s economy,” lauding the revised NEPA procedures as a fix of the system.

Melissa Simpson, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas trade group that represents Colorado and 12 other Western states, applauded the NEPA changes proposed as a “major step in removing roadblocks and spurring capital investments in American energy and infrastructure.”

Environmental advocates argue NEPA reforms will diminish act, public input

Ronni Flannery, senior staff attorney with The Wilderness Society, said the national environmental nonprofit is still combing through the various proposals, but sees some concerning themes.

“One thing that sort of strikes us is that there’s likely to be a lot of inconsistency in how these various provisions are applied, which means confusion among the regulated parties and just some challenges there,” Flannery said. “It certainly is a significant departure from what has operated as the rules of the game up till this point.”

While The Wilderness Society was supportive of some of the NEPA permitting reforms passed under Biden, other actions by the Trump administration and Republicans have signaled concerns for what the proposals will actually do. Part of this is that the Biden reforms included resource allocations to help agencies conduct NEPA reviews.

“Congress has now revoked resources and dollars that were earmarked for helping the agencies staff up and make sure that their environmental review processes and permitting processes are efficient and so that there’s adequate staffing,” Flannery said, adding that this will make it more difficult for agencies to conduct these environmental reviews.

A 2022 research study , which studied over 41,000 NEPA decisions completed by the U.S. Forest Service — which conducts more environmental impact statements than any other federal agency — between 2004 and 2020, concluded that delays in the permitting process were most often attributed to staff turnover, inadequate budgets, delays in receiving information from applications and more.

The study noted that these statements represent less than 1% of all NEPA decisions, but that data on other decisions is limited.

In addition to these reforms, Republicans included a “pay-to-play” provision for NEPA in Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which was signed into law last week. This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews. (A previous provision that would have also allowed entities paying the fee to avoid any judicial review of projects was removed from the final bill.)

These types of expeditious environmental reviews not only follow the administration’s effort to prioritize profit over people and shut out public input, but erode the protections NEPA offers, Flannery argued.

Already, there have been examples of “projects moving through the process at warp speed,” Flannery said.

This includes the Bureau of Land Management’s decision to expedite review of a proposal to increase oil transport out of the Uinta Basin in Utah — which Colorado lawmakers criticized — as well as a Bureau approved uranium mine expansion in southeast Utah , which was the first project to go forward with Trump’s expedited 14-day environmental review process that excluded public, input.

On the whole, Flannery said that in effect, these reforms and the administration, are “shutting the public out of government decision-making on decisions that impact the public and our national lands and waters.”

Public input, Flannery argued, is a key tenant of the environmental policy, also pointing to a 2025 study from the University of Arizona , which concluded that public comment on environmental impact statements influences outcomes and often results in substantive changes in federal agency decision making.

“NEPA was always intended to ensure that the government takes a close look at the health and environmental impacts of their actions and cumulatively,” Flannery said. “What we’re seeing from the administration and from some acts of Congress, is the severe eroding of these protections and the ability of the public to not only understand what the government is doing, but also to weigh in, express concerns and help influence the process to make sure that communities are protected.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2017/06/04221025/ROAN_1_8-24-1240x854.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:37.705701

One of the key changes for the automotive industry is that the bill eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles. EVs will become more expensive up front. The lease loophole, responsible for shockingly cheap deals on EVs, closes. The Slate pickup's entire business model is under threat. The move may even impact Jeep Wrangler sales; the popular 4xe hybrid model had been eligible for the full $7,500 credit.

Fortunately, if you're in the market for an EV, the federal tax credit is not going away immediately. Buyers can still take advantage of it if they take delivery before Sept. 30, 2025. Several EVs and plug-in hybrids meet the criteria for federal tax credit eligibility. Here are ten that you should consider buying before the tax credit gets eliminated in September.

All on this list are eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit until Sept. 30, 2025. We sourced performance data from manufacturer websites and EV range data from the EPA.

10 Acura ZDX

Acura revived the ZDX nameplate for its first EV. It's a midsize crossover, and like its Honda Prologue sibling, the ZDX runs on GM's Ultium platform that underpins the Chevrolet Blazer EV. It offers up to 500 horsepower, in Type S guise, and up to 313 miles of EV range.

Acura ZDX Specs

The ZDX starts at an MSRP of $64,500 for the rear-wheel-drive base model. The AWD version starts at $68,500, and the Type S begins at $73,500. So, all ZDX trims are currently below the $80,000 threshold to be eligible for the federal tax credit. Tax credits had potentially been pushing the price below that of the Honda CR-V hybrid.

9 Cadillac Lyriq

The Lyriq is Cadillac's first fully electric vehicle. It's a midsize crossover, and like the Acura above, it also uses the GM Ultium platform. The Lyriq offers up to 326 miles of range in single-motor and 319 miles of range in dual-motor AWD form. Buyers can level up to a 500 horsepower version.

Cadillac Lyriq Specs

The Lyriq has been a strong seller for Cadillac, thanks in part to the federal tax credit. All Lyriq trims are currently eligible for this, but it's not the only Caddy, as the new new three-row Visitiq crossover also squeezes in below the threshold in it's base configuration.

8 Chevy Equinox EV

The Chevrolet Equinox EV is not the sexiest electric vehicle on the market, but the compact crossover does deliver perhaps the best range for dollar spent value offer in the affordable realm. The Equinox offers 319 miles of EV range, which is impressive for a base trim starting at $33,600.

Chevrolet Equinox EV Specs

The Equinox EV is eligible to receive the full $7,500 federal tax credit. That can bring the base price down to an effective $26,100, bringing every Equinox EV trim below $40,000. The tax credit has also helped Chevrolet offer affordable, sub-$300/month lease deals. The federal tax credit also affects the Blazer EV and certain Silverado EV configurations.

7 Ford F-150 Lightning

The Ford F-150 pickup is America's most popular vehicle, so the automaker wanted to recreate that in the electric realm. Thus, the Blue Oval released the F-150 Lightning, which is, quite literally, an F-150 that happens to be electric. It offers up to 580 hp, 775 lb-ft of torque, and 320 miles of range with the Extended Range battery. It can also serve as a backup generator for your home, thoughthis does require a pricey home power setup.

Ford F-150 Lightning Specs

The F-150 Lightning starts at $54,780. However, buyers must upgrade to the $69,995 Flash trim to get an extended-range battery pack. All F-150 Lightning trims below Platinum are eligible for the federal tax credit, and Ford has been relaying that full credit to customers to bring the F-150 Lightning's costs down.

6 Genesis Electrified GV70

The Genesis Electrified GV70 isn't the most elegant name for an EV, or any car really. But if you can overlook that, it's a seriously impressive package. It resembles the standard GV70, especially since there is EV badging, but it does feature a faux grille. Although it rides on a different platform, it still utilizes the same electric motors and 350 kW fast-charging technology found in other Hyundai group EVs. It packs 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and that's before you send it into boost mode.

Genesis Electrified GV70 Specs

The Electrified GV70 starts at $64,380 MSRP with the base AWD trim. Buyers can level up to the Prestige AWD for $75,350. All trims are eligible for the federal tax credit, which keeps the base MSRP under $60,000.

5 Honda Prologue

We've already mentioned the Honda Prologue, so you might remember that it is a midsize electric crossover that rides on GM's Ultium crossover platform. The Prologue borrows some design language from the Civic. It has dramatically less power, though, topping out at 288 hp in AWD spec, but it can deliver up to 308 miles of range in FWD form.

Honda Prologue Specs

The Prologue starts at $47,400 and tops out with the $57,900 Elite trim. So, all versions are eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. Affordability has been a key part of the EV's appeal, as it can bring the effective cost of even the most expensive Prologue trims under $55,000.

4 Hyundai Ioniq 5

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a former World Car of the Year Award winner and one of the best all-around EVs on the market, with a combination of style, practicality, and advanced EV tech. The 2025 refresh introduces a larger 84-kWh battery pack, offering up to 318 miles of range in RWD and 290 miles in AWD, along with helpful additions such as a rear wiper. And it can deliver up to 641 hp in bursts with the Ioniq 5 N version.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 Specs

The Ioniq 5 starts at $42,600 for the SE Standard Range base model. However, most buyers will opt for the $46,650 SE version with the larger battery pack. The federal tax credit, eligible for all Ioniq 5 trims, can push the base price below $40,000. Hyundai has also been using the credit to offer affordable lease deals.

3 Kia EV6

The Kia EV6 shares the E-GMP platform and electric motors with the Ioniq 5. Kia opted for a sleek and sporty style over a retro-futuristic one, so the EV6 is a bit more wagon-like in its design than the Ioniq 5's hatchback shape. The EV6 offers up to 319 miles of range in RWD and 295 miles in AWD. The 577-hp EV6 GT can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds.

Kia EV6 Specs

The EV6 starts at $42,900. Trims range up to $63,800 for the EV6 GT model. All trims are eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, which can bring the base price to $35,400. Kia has been using the federal tax credit to pass on outstanding lease deals to customers as part of a bid to boost sales.

2 Kia EV9

The EV market needed an affordable, three-row family crossover, and Kia delivered it with the World Car of the Year Award-winning EV9. This model delivers stately and rugged style, performance (up to 379 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque), and the Hyundai E-GMP platform's class-leading charging tech. It can seat up to seven passengers or offer more than 80 cubic feet of cargo space. Kia is set to level things up even further with the EV9 GT.

Kia EV9 Specs

The Kia EV9 starts at $54,900 MSRP, which can be pushed below $50,000 using the federal tax credit. Kia has also been using the federal tax credit to offer affordable EV9 lease deals.

1 Tesla Model Y

The Model Y is Tesla's smaller crossover. It offers the same combination of range (up to 357 miles), style, and affordability as the Model 3, but in the crossover body style that most buyers prefer. And it has become the best-selling Tesla and best-selling EV by a wide margin. It was America's fourth best-selling overall vehicle in 2024, with more than 400,000 units sold. And it just received an overhaul for 2025.

Tesla Model Y Specs

Tesla has used the federal tax credit to keep the Model Y very affordable. The starting price currently sits at $44,900 MSRP for the RWD model and $48,900 for the AWD model. This brings both cars under $42,000 with the federal tax credit factored in. Every Tesla Model 3 and non-Cyberbeast Cybertruck is potentially eligible for the federal tax credit.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10-evs-you-should-buy-before-trump-s-big-beautiful-bill-comes-into-effect.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:11.028297
,EPA,2025-07-13 15:03:22+00:00,Inside Climate News,Baltimore's Wetlands Restoration Pushes Ahead Despite Federal Funding Setbacks,"Aman Azhar, Sarah Mattalian",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13072025/baltimore-wetlands-restoration-federal-funding-setbacks/,"The development in the last couple of years has been unrelenting, spurring the wave of gentrification that now defines this part of South Baltimore.
It’s not part of the planned wetlands or other investments the city and its implementing partners are pouring into the rest of South Baltimore.
One of those critics is Nicole Fabricant, an anthropology professor from Towson State University and environmental activist working in South Baltimore.
“The toxicity in South Baltimore has to do with the overburden of industries down there.
But they also do not deserve it less than Curtis Bay,” Rogers said.","BALTIMORE—Gravel crunched underfoot as Brad Rogers and Andrew Forbes stepped onto a narrow strip carved along a portion of the Patapsco River shoreline that’s slated to be a 9-acre tidal wetland.

At the site, just south of the Hanover Street Bridge, crews had been at work since last September, constructing a gravel sill that would hold new grasses. A muddy platform wound its way farther into the river, its edges blurring against the waves shimmering in the distance.

It’s just one small part of a multimillion dollar initiative jointly implemented by South Baltimore Gateway Partnership, a nonprofit led by Rogers, and its partner environmental engineering firm, Greenvest, where Forbes is a senior project manager.

Rogers slowed to observe the scene.

“When we were out here this morning, literally three hours ago, the tide was higher and this whole area was flooded—everywhere that looks like puddles now was ankle- or chin-deep water,” he said. “The gap in the breakwater allows water to flood in and out, and that sort of flushing connects what happens here with the Bay—fish, microorganisms and protein all exchanging between the wetland and open water.”

This stretch of shoreline along Hanover Street is one of four major sites under the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, a massive project aiming to breathe ecological life back into a river battered by decades of industrialization, stormwater runoff and urban neglect. When completed, the Hanover Street site will have low and high marshes and intertidal mudflats designed to absorb tidal surges, stabilize the shoreline and provide refuge to wildlife.

Rogers says the ecosystem is already attracting native species.

“The first thing I see is a beautiful great blue heron wading through a tidal pool we just finished building,” Rogers recalled. “We had just put the sand out, just planted the grasses. The water flooded in, and that heron—it just knew it was home. To one side was a snowy egret fishing, to the other, Canada geese with goslings nibbling in the grass.”

Only a year ago, the site was choked with trash and thick tangles of non-native plant species. Now, dead trees salvaged through the city’s Camp Small debris reuse program serve as perches for birds and carbon-rich habitat for organisms further down the food chain.

Construction began in the middle of last year with a stone sill snaking out roughly 150 to 200 feet from the shore into the Patapsco. Forbes and his team filled the interior with layers of sand and organic matter, a task made difficult by centuries of sedimentation at the river’s mouth. “The sub-base here is soft,” Forbes said. “You need more stone and sand than you think because it sinks. A lot of it disappears beneath the surface to create stability. You can’t see it, but it’s there, doing the work.”

But this spring, just as the marsh was beginning to take shape, a letter arrived. It was from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“The notification itself was very curt: There will not be money for the construction phase. No guidance, no next steps, just very factual. No explanation,” Rogers recalled.

Rogers’ nonprofit was originally awarded $32 million for wetlands restoration through FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a major climate resilience funding mechanism launched during the Biden administration. But in April, the Trump administration abruptly terminated BRIC, calling it a “wasteful, politicized grant program” in an official statement.

For Rogers, the sudden clawback could have delivered a major blow to the entire Middle Branch initiative. But his organization has been able to receive funding from multiple sources.

“We’ve built a program that goes beyond any one project. And having secured the BRIC grant brought us credibility to pull together a robust pipeline of multiple different avenues for raising capital funds,” Rogers said. “That grant provided a significant amount of credibility that accelerated our ability to grow the program.”

By Rogers’ estimate, the Hanover wetlands will be 90 percent complete by late summer. “All of these pieces are beginning to come together, and by the end of the summer, it’ll be 90 percent of the way there, and we’ll call the project done. And then a year later, the plants will be that much more grown in, and before you know it, it’ll just look like a giant natural system that’s always been there,” he said.

As he and Forbes walked back toward the exit, Rogers paused again near the new plantings. “This used to be a dumping ground,” he said. “Now, it’s becoming a refuge.”

Weathering FEMA’s Pullback

Brad Rogers remembers the moment clearly. He had already secured the funding. Years of planning and coalition-building were finally yielding results. Then the email came. FEMA was rescinding $26 million of the $32 million it had awarded his organization.

The BRIC cuts didn’t just affect his nonprofit—they impacted nearly a billion dollars’ worth of flood prevention and climate resilience projects across the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” the agency said in a statement announcing the cuts.

Of the $1 billion provided to BRIC under the 2021 Infrastructure and Jobs Act, around $882 million will be returned to the U.S. Treasury or reapportioned by Congress in the next fiscal year, according to the agency’s plans. Trump administration officials noted that their predecessors disbursed $133 million to about 450 applicants since the establishment of the grant program, according to the statement.

FEMA did not respond to multiple requests for comments about the rescinded funds and the likely impact an abrupt withdrawal of federal support will have on the projects already underway throughout Maryland and elsewhere in the country.

In Maryland, the cancellation affected dozens of planned upgrades to stormwater systems, shoreline protections and ecological buffer zones in vulnerable communities. Local governments were left scrambling to identify replacement funds.

“There are many organizations and governments across the country which are in far worse conditions than we are,” Rogers said. “I try to be respectful of the difference between what other people are facing and what we are.”

Rogers credited his nonprofit’s resilience to its structure—a unique hybrid of public and nonprofit actors—and its ability to forge alliances quickly.

The BRIC clawbacks hit Maryland’s small towns particularly hard. Crisfield, a low-lying city on the Eastern Shore, lost key funding for long-awaited stormwater upgrades and a planned flood barrier meant to shield the town from chronic flooding. The project, a key element of Crisfield’s Southern Flood Mitigation Plan, was years in the making and is now on hold.

In Baltimore City and across the county, sewer rehabilitation projects designed to reduce flooding and backups have been paused. Plans to invest in green infrastructure in historically neglected neighborhoods have similarly stalled.

Overall, the loss of funds has reverberated across rural towns and urban centers statewide. In places like Crisfield, where tax bases are small and adaptation plans depend on outside dollars, the absence of federal support has left little room to maneuver. In cities, climate and public health goals are impacted, forcing leaders to prioritize short-term goals over longer-term resilience projects.

FEMA’s decision has left communities scrambling for alternatives, as extreme weather events take a toll across Maryland and sea level rise threatens the gains made after decades of investments in restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

Rogers found it ironic that funds meant for resilience got pulled at a time when climate change and extreme weather events are making those investments all the more important.

Despite the loss, new support came from the state of Maryland, local agencies and private philanthropies. Smaller grants were put together. Some projects were scaled back. But the work continued.

Rogers felt that walking away from South Baltimore’s disinvested neighborhoods like Cherry Hill and Westport when the going got tough was not an option. It was important to show up, he said, even when it’s hard.

Reconnecting the River

A few hundred feet across the Hanover Street Bridge, traffic zipped past with the usual urgency of a weekday afternoon.

Rogers and Forbes stood still at the curb momentarily, scanning the oncoming traffic before crossing. On the other side, a narrow passage gave way to a shrubby clearing. Shoulder-high weeds brushed their sleeves as they pushed through, arriving suddenly into a wide, barren field plowed by heavy equipment.

This was Patapsco Delta East, Rogers said, the second wetlands site under construction as part of the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative. Unlike the gentle feel of the Hanover Street project, this site was defined by blunt force.

Excavators punctured the humid air, lifting tangled mats of mud and debris and dumping them to the side. A heap of dead reeds, storm-battered logs and trash sat exposed on one side of the landscape. The smell of earth and diesel came through in waves.

“This whole area used to be one giant mat of phragmites,” Rogers said of the invasive reeds, pointing toward the center of the site, where crews had begun carving a long, curving channel through the wetland base. “Invasive species choked the entire area and made it completely inaccessible.”

Here, between Hanover Street and Potee Street, was this stretch of land, left behind as a sort of ecological dead zone decades ago when overpasses were built around it. “There was no interaction between this site and the river,” Rogers explained. “So you have fish going up and down the river that have no access to the wetland over here that impaired its ecological function.”

That’s starting to change.

The team had been sculpting what Rogers called a “tidal gut”—a winding, sinewy channel meant to reintroduce the daily tidal flows from the Patapsco into the site. “It moves like a snake,” he said, adding that this design allows the tidal channel to naturally connect the restored wetland with the river, enabling water, fish and nutrients to flow in and out with the tides.

The regular exchange also brings in microorganisms and nutrients, creating a dynamic ecosystem that’s constantly refreshed by the Bay’s waters.

By planting new marshes and opening water channels to reconnect the ecosystem, the project aims to restore more than 12 acres of impaired land to the Middle Branch tidal system. “Instead of dumping more soil, like we did across the bridge, here we’re excavating,” Rogers said. “We’re removing the disconnect. That’s the work.”

Construction at the site broke ground in late February, just weeks before FEMA rescinded climate infrastructure funding. Though the Delta East site survived the cut, in part because construction on it had already begun, the clawback did affect the broader project. Designs for a fourth site, farther along the river’s bend, didn’t make it beyond the planning phase.

The MedStar Harbor Hospital site to the north will be the third major wetland restoration under the initiative and is due to break ground later this year. While each site differs in many ways, they fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle: one extending into the river, another carved back into land, the third reclaiming industrial fill.

The Road Ahead

After leaving Forbes, Rogers drove past the edge of the cleared wetland, now behind metal fencing, and headed north toward the Baltimore Peninsula. In the distance, tower cranes dotted the skyline.

New apartment complexes came into view alongside the shimmering waterfront and the global headquarters of the activewear brand Under Armour. The development in the last couple of years has been unrelenting, spurring the wave of gentrification that now defines this part of South Baltimore.

But not every neighborhood has seen similar growth. Curtis Bay, for instance, a working-class community on the city’s southern edge, sits isolated from these developments. There, residents live next to coal terminals and chemical tanks.

The neighborhood shares the same Patapsco shoreline that remains vulnerable to storm surge and has eroded during decades of disinvestment. It’s not part of the planned wetlands or other investments the city and its implementing partners are pouring into the rest of South Baltimore.

The question of whether Curtis Bay should develop as an industrial zone, as some city authorities have previously suggested, or thrive as a residential community has eclipsed its development. Residents and local community groups have long urged officials to enforce stricter environmental controls to mitigate toxic pollution and invest in civic amenities. But the tension has resulted in lost opportunities, advocates believe.

As Inside Climate News previously reported, communities across South Baltimore have also questioned whether the city’s environmental restoration projects—however ecologically beneficial—also reinforce existing inequities by concentrating benefits where capital investment is already flowing. Despite its habitat gains, some critics feel the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative aligns too comfortably with real estate timelines and branding efforts surrounding the waterfront redevelopment.

One of those critics is Nicole Fabricant, an anthropology professor from Towson State University and environmental activist working in South Baltimore. She believes that the problems in neighborhoods like Curtis Bay and Cherry Hill stem from the legacy industries, including coal piers and the giant incinerator that burns much of the city’s trash.

“I’m always skeptical of some of these shiny projects that often extract from the poor and benefit the wealthy. It’s like a quick-fit techno solution to deeply structural problems,” Fabricant said. “If instead we actually held corporate polluters accountable, and enforced some of the environmental regulations at the state level, we would see much cleaner, healthier environments.”

Fabricant said projects like shoreline improvements are attractive to public and private funders because they avoid going after corporate polluters, which is where the problem lies, in her opinion.

“The toxicity in South Baltimore has to do with the overburden of industries down there. But a lot of these bigger environmental projects are not willing to take on big polluters or to really identify the corporate entities that benefit from cheap lands and demobilize communities,” she said. “Until we actually enforce those environmental regulations, we’ll continue to see these techno quick fixes that aren’t really addressing the root problems.”

In the end, she said, a project like the Middle Branch Initiative, designed to restore the natural world lost to decades of industrialization, is unable to reconnect the Black communities in places like Curtis Bay because its very design prevents it from doing so. That, critics like Fabricant say, is one of its biggest weaknesses: a structural limitation that risks deepening the very inequities it aims to heal.

Rogers is aware of the criticism.

He said that while Curtis Bay is a part of South Baltimore and touches the Patapsco River, it is not adjacent to the Middle Branch and is outside the remit of their work. “This is the difficult reality: reimagining 11 miles of shoreline is incredibly ambitious and difficult, but it also doesn’t resolve all the problems faced across South Baltimore,” he said.

Rogers said he understood the concern that the initiative might only restore environmental quality for people who can afford to live in gentrifying areas where the people the project purports to serve once lived. “These are legitimate worries, and we should always be attentive to them,” he said, adding that the two ongoing projects and the one waiting to break ground at MedStar Harbor Hospital will benefit the Brooklyn and Cherry Hill neighborhoods, home to low-income Black and brown communities with limited shoreline access.

“Cherry Hill and Brooklyn do not deserve environmental quality and resiliency more than Curtis Bay. But they also do not deserve it less than Curtis Bay,” Rogers said.

For disinvested neighborhoods like Curtis Bay, which is not served by the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, the abrupt cut in federal funding has made a bad situation worse. Since FEMA pulled the plug on BRIC grants and similar uncertainty surrounds the promised funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, smaller community nonprofits and well-funded groups like Rogers’ alike are left to navigate a rapidly changing funding landscape.

But there’s opportunity in every crisis. Rogers’ nonprofit just secured new funding from the Maryland Department of the Environment—$17 million in total—through the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund and the Comprehensive Flood Management Program.

The infusion, he said, reinforces his belief that the Middle Branch strategy can align multiple priorities at once: flood protection, habitat renewal and water quality. “We sit at this interesting nexus point between resiliency, restoration, recreation, water quality and habitat. Depending on the site and the funder’s goals, we’re able to mix and match and tap into multiple simultaneous funding streams,” he said.

As he drove past the new townhomes along Cromwell Street, Rogers pointed out another reality.

“Many people who are well educated in environmental science or climate science may be able to talk for hours about carbon sequestration, but wouldn’t know what to do with an excavator,” Rogers said. “You really need to have a team that brings together all of those disciplines—estimating costs, designing, permitting and building the project. Those are essential components of being effective in the world.”

It’s a perspective he’s come to appreciate over years in the nonprofit sector—one shaped less by idealism and more by implementation. “Our state and local partners have been more interested in figuring out opportunities for collaboration than they even were in the past,” he continued, “because now they know that their budgets are going to be tighter, and so they have to think creatively about how to find new partners.”

While Rogers’ organization has weathered the first round of cuts, the broader picture remains fuzzy. Many community-scale nonprofits—especially those without in-house technical staff, grant writers or political access—are still left to ponder the fate of their canceled plans.

As he parked the car outside his office, Rogers glanced at his phone, already vibrating with a new string of messages. He exhaled, shifted the gear into park, and looked up once more toward the shimmering shoreline visible in the distance.

“It’s not easy,” he said. “But I’m glad it’s coming together.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Library-4-of-11-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:46.863582

Local residents are demanding better communication and transparency from the refinery.

The coalition is requesting a community meeting, an alert system, a 24/7 contact number, regular monitoring data reports, and neighborhood air quality monitors.

El Pasoans were left with little to no answers as huge black plumes of smoke overtook the city and flames burst through smokestacks at the Marathon Refinery in South Central.

""We deserve to know what is going on at the refinery,"" said Matthew Moriel, who lives in the Corbin-Sambrano neighborhood a few blocks from the refinery. ""We need to know if we need to be indoors and whether we need to turn off our swamp coolers to keep the polluted air from coming inside. It is unacceptable for a refinery in the middle of the city to be unreachable by those who live closest to its pollution.""

Large plumes of black smoke and flames started coming out of smokestacks from Marathon Refinery, located at 212 North Clark Drive near Alameda Avenue, about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 8.

Moriel and other neighbors began calling the refinery for information on what was happening at the plant, but only heard from a security guard, who took a message. The neighbors never heard back from the refinery operators.

In an unnamed emailed statement, a Marathon Petroleum Corp. spokesperson told the El Paso Times the incident was caused by a power outage.

""Due to a power outage from a third-party provider on July 8, operating conditions at Marathon’s El Paso refinery made flaring necessary,"" the statement said. ""Flares are safety devices that allow for the safe combustion of excess gases during certain operating conditions.""

The company reported no injuries during the incident or harmful environmental impact on the area.

""Air monitoring was deployed as a precaution, and no off-site impacts were detected,"" the statement said.

Community asking for transparency, better communication

Houston in Action’s Sembrando Esperanza Coalition, a group led ""by residents of 11 of the most historic, resilient, polluted, and hottest working class neighborhoods in El Paso County,"" is asking for more transparency and communication from Marathon Refinery leaders, a news release from the coalition said.

“Even if what happened (July 8) does not result in a violation of state or federal rules, it does not mean the fumes were not toxic and dangerous to our health, environment and pets,"" Sembrando Esperanza Coalition's Climate Justice and Civil Rights organizer Veronica Carbajal said. ""Further, we won’t know what was in the fumes or how it affected our air quality until the monitoring data is released. In the meantime, nearby residents deserve to know what precautions to take and who to call in such emergencies.”

The group is asking for Marathon Refinery to:

Host a meeting for neighbors to attend and discuss their concerns

Create an alert system for neighbors close to the refinery

Provide neighbors a number they can call 24/7 and speak with a human being every time neighbors see, hear or smell something out of the ordinary

Regular reports of the monitoring data

Air quality monitors to be placed in the neighborhood, including those that read the carcinogens released by the refinery

Marathon Refinery officials said they already have policies in place to alert residents to any dangers.

""The safety of workers, our neighbors, and the environment is our top priority,"" Marathon Refinery's statement said. ""If a situation potentially requires action by members of the community, we advise designated local authorities, following pre-established frameworks, and then work with those authorities, media and others to convey information to the community as needed.""

What is flaring?

The El Paso refinery ""processes sweet and sour crude oils into gasoline, distillates, heavy fuel oil, propane, asphalt, and NGLs (Natural Gas Liquids) and petrochemicals,"" according to an annual report by the company.

Flaring is the process of burning off excess or waste gases that cannot be processed or reused, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Flaring safely releases excess pressure from refinery equipment, especially during emergencies or maintenance.

Flaring can release harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, a study published in the Science research journal. The pollutants released by flaring can lead to health issues like asthma, heart attacks, and premature deaths, particularly in communities near refineries, the study states.

Data on the types and quantities of pollutants released during the El Paso Marathon Refinery's flaring have not been released.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time could also claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S.-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which are all headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 13:08:00.901041

This reflects its role as the world’s manufacturing hub, with heavy reliance on coal and high industrial output.

In fact, China’s share of global manufacturing is also about the same (27%) showing the direct consequence of becoming the world’s production base.

The country has committed to peaking emissions before 2030, but its growth trajectory poses challenges.

This also means any progress on climate will hinge heavily both on China’s policy decisions and global consumer behavior.

U.S. and India Round Out the Top Three Carbon Emissions

The U.S. is the second-largest emitter at 6.0 GtCO₂e (11.3% of global emissions).

And this is with around 330 million people, or one-fourth of China’s population. It’s per capita emissions (15 tCO₂e) is also top-15 in the world.

In stark contrast, India ranks third with 4.1 GtCO₂e (7.8%), lower than the U.S., with four times the number of people. However, its emissions are rising as its economy and population grow, following a similar path Western industrialized countries took to prosperity.

Smaller Countries with Outsized Carbon Emissions

Nations like Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Canada appear further down the list, but have some of the highest per capita emissions globally.

Their rankings reflect both resource-driven economies and energy-intensive lifestyles.

Meanwhile, countries like Brazil and Indonesia have large emissions tied to economic development, deforestation, and land use.

Yes, it's just another tiny electric city car. There's only so much an automaker can do with that footprint, but somehow Honda has given this a load of character. Even though we can't even really see the bodywork, this little car screams fun. Well, more like shouts fun quietly but adorably.

Honda called it an ""all-electric urban concept vehicle."" Now it is saying the car ""realizes both practical usability and the 'joy of driving' only Honda can offer.""

Check out those TE37s. This is proof positive that the design works on anything, at least anything built after about 1975. They're a 16-inch size, which is delightfully compact. No, we don't think a production car will use this wheel, but we can dream, right?

Funky Design, Affordable Features

Up close, the Super EV looks just as adorable and funky as it did in Honda's shots. We can see more of it now, too, including just how boxy those arches are, the cuts in the doorlines, and the Honda badge in the nose. Honda is hiding the interior away from us, sadly, but that's probably because it's an early prototype.

Honda's also hiding many of the details, but we did manage to get them to admit it's front-wheel drive with a single electric motor, will be a direct successor to the Honda e, and will be far more affordable. Things like the conventional door mirrors are key in achieving that affordable price point, although the exact figure Honda is targeting is still a secret.

Why does Honda think this one could work when the Honda e couldn't? This car looks like it will be more cost-effective than the e. While that other Honda was another adorable electric, it was loaded with high-tech and expensive goodies. Cameras instead of side mirrors, for example, and screens that ran from pillar to pillar inside the cabin. And yes, those are rear drum brakes. On a car this size, it doesn't matter. Regen does most of the work, and drums are cheaper. Even some Audi EV models that cost tens of thousands more have rear drums for exactly those reasons.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/honda-super-ev-concept-goodwood-3.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:35.539924

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.
This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.
In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects.
“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright has heard a lot of doomsday predictions about the rollback of wind and solar subsidies in President Trump’s sweeping tax cut bill.

He has one simple answer: “They’re just wrong.”

Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive with roots in solar and geothermal, said intermittent renewables are a costly impediment on the nation’s electrical grid, and the sooner they are replaced by reliable sources such as natural gas, coal or nuclear, the faster costs will come down.

“If you look at the places that have spent the most subsidies and built the largest amount of wind and solar, the more cheap energy you put on our grid, the more expensive the grid becomes,” Mr. Wright said in an interview with The Washington Times.

The cost of cutting taxes in Mr. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill is paid for in part by axing a slate of subsidies for green energy projects, including wind and solar, by 2026.

The elimination of the renewable subsidies, the Joint Committee on Taxation determined, will save nearly $500 billion over ten years.

But opponents warn it will kill jobs, hike energy bills and ultimately weaken the power grid by discouraging future wind and solar projects, which will slow the growth of grid capacity as demand rises. Or, they warn, solar and wind projects will move ahead but at a higher, unsubsidized cost that will be passed along to ratepayers.

Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the tax subsidies, called the cuts “an outright massacre” for wind and solar.

“Not only will hundreds of thousands of Americans who work in clean energy lose their jobs right away, individual families and businesses of all sizes nationwide will get clobbered with higher utility bills,” the Oregon Democrat said.

The media coverage has been overwhelmingly dire, honing in on states like Minnesota, which have invested heavily in wind and solar projects, and turning to clean energy advocates for assessments on how these states will be impacted by the cuts.

San Francisco-based Energy Innovation, which advocates for ending fossil fuels, calculated that subsidy cuts would increase annual energy bills in Minnesota households by $6 billion between 2025 and 2034.

“This is due to higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices,” the organization wrote in an analysis of the legislation.

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.

Natural gas, he said, “is just by far and away, the cheapest source of electricity today.”

California, for example, ditched coal and natural gas for wind and solar, and imports its renewable power from Utah and Nevada, among other states. Florida went in the opposite direction, investing in the construction of natural gas pipelines.

“California’s electricity prices today are twice as high as Florida’s. California has by far the largest population of any state in the country. They produce less electricity than Florida does,” said the energy secretary.

On average, the cost of onshore wind and solar is cheaper than fossil fuels, but they only produce power some of the time and require nuclear, coal and natural gas to rev up at night, when it’s cloudy or when the wind is not blowing. This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.

Wind turbines and solar arrays take up more land than non-renewable energy plants and require new transmission lines.

“You really have to maintain two grids,” Mr. Wright said. “When it’s the middle of the day, when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, all the other plants have to turn down to accommodate the wind and sun. Then they’ve got to be turned back up. And that is not an efficient way to run huge machinery. You have to operate your existing grid less efficiently than before, and you have to pay for a second grid.”

Mr. Wright said the tax cut legislation will steer states away from adding renewables to the grid and drive them to build reliable sources that run all the time.

“You still have the ability to generate electricity in all these states. They’re just not going to keep adding to that secondary, parasitic, more expensive grid,” he said.

In Minnesota, subsidized costs of wind and solar climbed even after passage of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which implemented many of the tax credits for new renewable projects now targeted for elimination in Mr. Trump’s bill.

More than a third of the state’s energy is produced by renewables. A state law requires utilities to produce 100% of their electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2040.

The Center of the American Experiment, a conservative think tank in Minnesota, found that rising wind and solar prices have made them the most expensive sources of electricity in the state “by a substantial margin.”

It calculated that electricity produced by new wind projects costs twice as much as electricity from existing coal plants.

The cost of electricity from new solar projects in the state was triple the cost generated by existing coal plants, the group found. It blamed rising prices for wind turbines and solar panels.

Many states have shifted to renewables to reduce emissions and convert to clean energy produced by solar and wind.

In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law in 2022 mandating that the state achieve a zero-carbon electrical grid by 2040.

The ambitious plan is blamed in part for the state’s skyrocketing energy bills, although green energy groups say the real blame lies with global warming, which they say has caused extreme weather events and ultra-hot summers.

Mr. Wright said Mr. Trump’s January executive order blocking most new offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard will spare Connecticut ratepayers even higher utility bills in the future.

Offshore wind is one of the most expensive forms of energy on the planet, he said.

Connecticut energy bills are among the highest in the nation and were expected to increase when the offshore wind projects went online. Eversource, a main provider of power in New England, projected offshore wind would cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, which is almost double the cost of energy provided by the state’s Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.

“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.

Mr. Wright said the high energy costs in the northeast will be reduced by the Trump administration’s revival of a natural gas pipeline project extending from the Marcellus Shale gas fields in northern Pennsylvania to New York and into markets in New England, where consumers pay the highest electricity rates in the nation.

“New England has expensive energy for choices, and the biggest choice they’ve made is just to not have enough connection to the natural gas pipeline network,” he said.

Critics warn that if states abandon solar and wind for natural gas, it would take several years for the permitting and construction of new natural gas plants and much longer to build nuclear power plants. This could leave electrical grids without enough energy and consumers on the hook for higher prices.

Mr. Wright said states will have to change regulations to allow for the expansion of natural gas, which could happen faster now that subsidies for wind and solar are headed for a quick phase-out under the new tax cut law and Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

“Ultimately, if they don’t build all the offshore wind and all that, you’ll probably see an expansion in natural gas-generated electricity,” he said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/02/Alaska_Trump_Energy_Oil_Field_Tour_13733_c0-207-4964-3102_s1200x700.jpg?05818a1aae4a18625e6d2f3787522970c4e058bd,N,,2025-07-13 11:18:45.020922

If you have to build one then it's way longer. All this chaos is costing us jobs. Companies that don't feel safe to invest are canceling programs due to uncertainty. Then they're laying people off due to lack of work.

President cheetoh mussolini is setting us back by decades. The only thing saving the US auto industry rigjt now is the tarriffs on Chinese EVs. If it weren't for them the big 3 would be toast.

EVs are priced taking the tax credit into account, and with huge margins in comparison to ICE cars, so I wouldn't be surprised if out the door prices end up being more or less the same after the credit goes away. The cost of LFP batteries is projected to drop to $50 a kwh by the end of 2025, which means EVs will hit manufacturing cost parity with ICE cars.

EV sales are continuing to grow year over year in the US. People who have EV’s in general have said they will never go back to a gas car. As more people get experience with EV’s more people will realize the perceived issues with charging and range anxiety are unfounded.

When more affordable options become available the EV market will continue to rise at a quick rate.

they're still increasing every year.

Also tired of the myth that most EV user are hanging out waiting for their car to charged. It almost universally comes from a ICE driver who never tried an EV. I'll admit EVs still have a ways to go for apartment dwellers or people without access to overnight or work charging, but for many homeowners, we spend less time at charging stations than you spend at the gas station.

Here's a scenario. I used to fill up 1-2x per week in my ATS. I drove a lot, about 20k a year. I recently got an EV. I upped my driving even more and now i'm driving 24k a year. In one entire year, i spent 18 minutes total at supercharger stations. The rest was simply plugging my car in while it sit and while i sleep in my driveway. I think homeowners(or anyone with easy access to overnight charging) should think of it this way, ""If i left every morning with 3/4 tank, how often would I need to visit the gas station"". For me the answer to that was 2x the whole year. I imagine for most people that would be between 4-8x per year.

A lot of ICE owners try to think of things like you need to go out of your way to charge and you need to wait until you're empty to start charging, but you don't charge like that

EVs were taking off and the infrastructure was coming very soon at the previous rate.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:32.298693

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency.","The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) revolution hinges on one critical factor: domestic control of critical minerals like lithium. Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass Project in Nevada is now the linchpin of this ambition, combining secured funding, strategic partnerships, and federal incentives to position the U.S. as a self-sufficient player in the lithium supply chain. With construction ramping up and a 2027 operational target, investors are presented with a rare opportunity to profit from the intersection of energy independence, EV demand, and geopolitical risk mitigation.

The Funding Firewall: DOE Loans and Private Investments Secure the Supply Chain

Thacker Pass is no longer a speculative project—it is a fully funded, shovel-ready juggernaut. The $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), approved under the Biden administration's Critical Mineral Strategy, will see its first draw in Q3 2025, with the remaining funds staged to cover construction through 2027. This public backing is paired with a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners, which closed in April 2025, and a $100 million cash infusion from General Motors (GM). Together, these moves have created a funding “firewall” to shield the project from market volatility and geopolitical disruptions.

The DOE's involvement is particularly critical. The loan includes terms requiring domestic content for equipment and labor, directly aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. Lithium Americas' focus on local jobs—2,000 direct construction roles—and partnerships with the North America Building Trades Unions ensure compliance while bolstering U.S. manufacturing ecosystems.

GM's Stake: A Direct Pipeline to EV Demand

GM's 38% equity stake in Thacker Pass is more than a financial bet—it's a strategic play for EV supply chain dominance. The automaker has secured a 20-year offtake agreement for 100% of Phase 1's 40,000-tonne lithium carbonate output, enough to power 800,000 EVs annually. This partnership eliminates middlemen, reducing costs by 15-20% compared to spot-market lithium procurement.

For investors, GM's involvement is a guarantee of demand. As EV sales grow at a 25%+ CAGR through 2030, Thacker Pass's production will directly feed into GM's battery factories (e.g., Ultium Cells' $7 billion investment in Ohio). This symbiosis positions Lithium Americas as a de-risked play on EV adoption, insulated from lithium price swings through long-term pricing agreements.

The IRA Multiplier Effect: Tax Credits and Geopolitical Risk Mitigation

The Inflation Reduction Act's $30 billion in clean energy incentives supercharges Thacker Pass's value. Lithium Americas qualifies for IRA credits tied to domestic production, including:

- 40% investment tax credit for facilities using union labor and local materials.

- Battery credits for EVs using U.S.-sourced lithium, which could add $1,500–$7,500 per vehicle in subsidies for GM.

These incentives create a virtuous cycle: Thacker Pass's lithium enables U.S.-made EVs to claim IRA credits, while the IRA's tax breaks lower project costs. Meanwhile, the project's proximity to Nevada's “Lithium Loop” (from mining to recycling) ensures it becomes a hub for domestic battery supply chains, reducing reliance on Chinese lithium refining.

Timeline and Risk Mitigation: A 2027 Milestone with Safeguards

Construction is on track to meet its late 2027 completion target, with:

- 60% of engineering already complete (90% expected by year-end).

- Structural steel fabrication underway, with first installations in September 2025.

- Risk mitigation via a limestone quarry (to cut costs) and a 75% local cost base (labor/services), minimizing tariff exposure.

While regulatory risks linger (e.g., tribal land disputes), the project has secured permits and court rulings supporting its path forward. Lithium Americas' cash reserves ($446.9M as of March 2025) provide further financial cushioning.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip Before 2027's Payoff

Lithium Americas' stock (LAC) has underperformed lithium peers recently, reflecting near-term losses from construction costs. However, the 2027 operational ramp-up is the inflection point. Key catalysts include:

1. Q3 2025 DOE Loan Draw: Signals execution strength.

2. 2026 Earthworks Completion: A physical milestone for investors.

3. GM's Production Ramp: Lithium sales will begin flowing into earnings by 2028.

Investment Strategy:

- Buy on dips below $5.50/share (current ~$6.20), targeting a 2027 valuation of $10–12/share.

- Hold for the long term: Thacker Pass's 40+ year mine life and expansion potential (up to 100,000 tpa) create multi-decade earnings growth.

- Consider options or ETNs: Lithium ETFs (e.g., LIT) offer diversification but lack the pure-play upside of LAC.

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age

Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency. With GM's demand locked in, DOE's financial and regulatory backing, and IRA incentives turbocharging returns, this project is a generational investment. For those willing to look past short-term volatility, the path to 2027—and dominance of the EV supply chain—is clear.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:07:52.880373

Among them, Rio Tinto's dual-state strategy in Arizona and Utah positions it as a pivotal player in reshaping the nation's mineral security. With President Trump's 50% copper import tariffs now in effect, domestic projects like Resolution Copper and the expanded Kennecott mine are set to capitalize on structural demand shifts. This article argues that Rio Tinto's investments represent a compelling opportunity to profit from both policy-driven market dynamics and the surging need for critical minerals.

The Tariff Tailwind: Manufacturing a Domestic Copper Renaissance

The Trump administration's 50% tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, 2025, marks a decisive shift toward reshoring critical mineral production. By penalizing imports from top suppliers like Chile and Peru—sources of 82% of U.S. copper imports—the tariffs create a $1.5 billion annual price advantage for domestic producers. This structural shift has already driven U.S. copper prices to a $5.60/lb premium over global benchmarks, a trend set to accelerate as global demand for clean energy infrastructure (electric vehicles, solar panels) outpaces supply.

Resolution Copper: A Game-Changer in Reducing Import Dependency

Resolution Copper, Rio Tinto's flagship project in Arizona, is poised to supply up to 25% of U.S. copper demand once operational by the late 2020s. With 1.6 billion metric tons of ore and a $61 billion projected economic impact, the mine's development hinges on a final August 2025 land transfer approval. This milestone follows a Supreme Court ruling dismissing Indigenous land claims, clearing a major legal hurdle. The project's block-caving technology and water-efficient design (using 5 gallons/lb of copper, half the industry average) also address environmental concerns, ensuring alignment with ESG priorities.

Kennecott's Role in Utah: A Steady Engine of Production

While Resolution Copper captures headlines, Rio Tinto's Kennecott mine in Utah remains the unsung backbone of its U.S. strategy. Producing 300,000 tons of refined copper annually, Kennecott's underground expansions (including the NRS project) will extend its lifespan to 2040. By integrating mining, smelting, and refining under one roof, Kennecott avoids tariff-driven supply chain disruptions, acting as a reliable domestic supplier for industries like construction and renewables.

Strategic Alignment with U.S. Critical Minerals Policy

The U.S. government's Critical Minerals Strategy, updated in 2025, explicitly names copper as essential for national defense and energy infrastructure. Rio Tinto's projects directly address this mandate:

- Geopolitical Security: Reducing reliance on foreign sources (82% of imports from politically unstable regions).

- Energy Transition: Copper's role in EV batteries (40 kg per vehicle vs. 20 kg in ICE vehicles) ensures steady demand.

- Tax Incentives: The Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion clean energy tax credits further subsidize domestic production.

Why Invest Now? Timeline, Demand, and Risk-Adjusted Returns

Project Milestones: The August 2025 land transfer for Resolution Copper is a binary catalyst. If approved, construction begins by 2027, with first production by 2031.

Demand Surge: Global copper demand for EVs alone is projected to grow by 250% by 2030, per the International Energy Agency.

Risk-Adjusted Case: While permitting delays or legal challenges linger, Resolution's progress and the tariff-driven premium create a robust margin of safety.

Risks and Considerations

Permitting Delays: U.S. environmental reviews can stretch timelines, though Resolution's decade-long EIS process mitigates this risk.

Environmental Opposition: Tribal groups and green advocates may prolong litigation, though courts have consistently upheld the project's legal basis.

Global Oversupply: A potential copper glut in 2030 could pressure prices, though tariffs and domestic demand should cushion impacts.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

During this real-life test of the battery base installed in Texas, it generated more than 6 GW of electricity on Friday evening, helping to stabilize the grid with less input from fossil fuel-powered plants that are typically used for managing load during peak times.

The robust performance of the large-scale battery energy storage systems in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid came without shutdowns like the one that happened in Southern Europe this spring, too.

After the global solar power installation reached 600 GW last year, and is on its way to hit 1 TW annually in the next few, storing all that energy for discharge in peak times has become a pressing question.

It is not clear what share of the storage battery projects in Texas is done with Tesla Megapacks. Just last August, ERCOT added 480 MW in battery storage projects to the grid, and these included Tesla's own BESS installed at its Gigafactory in Austin.

Its Megapacks still use Chinese LFP cells, though, of the type that are in popular mobile power stations like the Anker Solix C1000. So do most other grid-level battery systems in Texas, and even Tesla's intent to produce LFP batteries in America won't change that share in a meaningful way any time soon.

Texas is leading the country in the deployment speed of BESS projects coming online, and the installed US base is now second after China. Scale is important, as renewable energy sources like wind and solar might be one of the cheapest ways to generate electricity, but pairing all that energy with storage solutions quickly changes the calculus in favor of nuclear and others.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Tesla-gigafactory-texas.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:11:06.905264

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world's largest untapped renewable energy resource.
Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a ""very significant milestone"" that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.
Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy.
With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.","Submerged in about 44 yards of water off Scotland's coast, a turbine has been spinning for more than six years to harness the power of ocean tides for electricity -- a durability mark that demonstrates the technology's commercial viability.

Keeping a large, or grid-scale, turbine in place in the harsh sea environment that long is a record that helps pave the way for bigger tidal energy farms and makes it far more appealing to investors, according to the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. Tidal energy projects would be prohibitively expensive if the turbines had to be taken out of the water for maintenance every couple of years.

Tidal energy technologies are still in the early days of their commercial development, but their potential for generating clean energy is big. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world's largest untapped renewable energy resource.

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually. Earlier this month, the Swedish company SKF announced that its bearings and seals on one of the turbines had passed the 6½-year mark without needing unplanned or disruptive maintenance. It has been working closely with the industry for a decade on design and testing.

Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a ""very significant milestone"" that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.

Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy. The MeyGen site, operated by SAE Renewables, has been sending electricity to the grid for about eight years.

There are very few tidal energy projects generating electricity continuously. Most have been tests and demonstrations, said Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development. Copping said there are still large hurdles to overcome before tidal energy can be adopted more widely, such as dealing with regulatory issues, potential environmental effects and conflicts with other ocean users.

Still, the Scotland project seems to have addressed the question of whether the turbines can last in seawater, added Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

""I think they have checked the boxes,"" she said. ""Because skeptics, and that includes investors of course and governments, said, 'How on Earth are you going to operate these things especially for any length of time in this very tough environment?' And that's what I think they proved.""

It's very hard to take what is essentially a wind turbine normally found on land and put it under water, said Fraser Johnson, operations and maintenance manager at MeyGen. The record-setting turbine should keep going for at least another year before it needs to come out of the water for maintenance, he added.

The four turbines are in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a narrow channel between the Scottish mainland and Stroma Island known for strong tidal currents. Tidal energy systems need strong currents to make electricity efficiently. MeyGen plans to add 20 turbines in 2030 to produce more electricity, after needed upgrades to the electricity grid are finished. The site could eventually hold as many as 130 turbines that are more powerful than those at the site today.

The MeyGen site is in the open water, while another type of tidal project involves creating a dam-like structure called a barrage across tidal waters. With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.

""It's a title we wish we didn't have. We want more, we want others,"" he said. ""Unfortunately others are having difficulty achieving what MeyGen has achieved. But working with SKF moving forward, we'll push the industry forward.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/210560126_210552522-25daa91bb58e4231adbbed308fecd5fd_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:38.680950

Meanwhile, Enbridge's valuation metrics have stretched.
The Long-Term Case: Moats, Cash Flows, and Dividend Resilience Despite these near-term headwinds, Enbridge's core strengths remain intact.
Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate.","Investors in Enbridge (ENB) face a classic conundrum: a company with a fortress-like balance sheet and a pipeline of regulated, cash-generating projects is currently trading at valuation levels that reflect little margin for error. While near-term risks—elevated debt, regulatory uncertainty, and overperformance—loom large, the stock's intrinsic value is underpinned by structural tailwinds. For income investors, the math remains compelling, but momentum traders should tread carefully.

The Near-Term Crosscurrents: Debt, Valuation, and Regulatory Overhang

Enbridge's debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.9x (as of Q1 2025) has drawn scrutiny, particularly as the metric includes partial contributions from recently acquired U.S. gas utilities. Management expects the ratio to improve toward its 4.5–5.0x target range as these assets contribute fully in 2025. However, the company's $2.8 billion in February 2025 senior note issuances—spanning 3-year to 30-year maturities—highlight its reliance on debt markets to fund growth.

Meanwhile, Enbridge's valuation metrics have stretched. At a trailing P/E of ~18x (vs. its 5-year average of 15x), the stock trades at a premium to peers like Kinder Morgan (KMI) and TC Energy (TRP). This premium reflects investor optimism about its $28 billion secured growth backlog, but it leaves little room for missteps. A misfire on regulatory approvals or a delay in projects like the Traverse Pipeline (pending permits for its 1.8 Bcf/d capacity expansion) could trigger a reassessment.

Regulatory risks remain a wildcard. In Canada, the newly elected government's stance on energy infrastructure—particularly the contentious Alberta-to-Prince Rupert pipeline—could introduce headwinds. In the U.S., state-level rate cases in North Carolina and Utah underscore the need for disciplined regulatory engagement to protect margins.

The Long-Term Case: Moats, Cash Flows, and Dividend Resilience

Despite these near-term headwinds, Enbridge's core strengths remain intact. Its Mainline expansion, a cornerstone of its growth strategy, is progressing steadily. The pipeline's record Q1 throughput of 3.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) signals strong demand from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which Enbridge expects to grow by ~1 mbpd by 2035. Phase 1 of the Mainline Optimization—leveraging 150 kbpd of incremental capacity on the Flanagan South Pipeline—bolsters this narrative.

The company's regulated asset base—including its U.S. gas utilities and Canadian distribution networks—provides a predictable earnings stream. Regulated projects like the Birch Grove expansion (adding $400 million to the backlog) and the Traverse Pipeline are underpinned by cost-of-service models, shielding cash flows from commodity price volatility.

Crucially, Enbridge's dividend resilience remains a pillar of its appeal. With a 5-year average dividend growth rate of ~2%, the stock's ~5.8% dividend yield (as of July 2025) offers income investors a cushion against short-term price fluctuations. Management's reaffirmed 2025 DCF guidance ($5.50–$5.90 per share) underscores confidence in its ability to fund payouts even amid macro challenges.

Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays

For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate. The stock's ~7–9% EBITDA growth through 2026 and its long-term 5% annual growth trajectory post-2026 suggest that total shareholder returns (TSR) will outpace short-term volatility.

However, momentum traders face a tougher calculus. The stock's ~18% YTD return in 2025 (as of July) has compressed its valuation cushion. Near-term catalysts—including regulatory outcomes for the Traverse Pipeline and the Southern Illinois Connector's open season results—could lead to sharp price swings. Without a catalyst to justify further upside, the risk-reward tilts toward caution.

The world's first intelligent grid-forming photovoltaic and energy storage power station, tailored for ultra-high altitudes, low-temperatures and weak-grid scenarios, has been connected to the grid in Ngari Prefecture, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region.

In a landscape with an average altitude of about 4,700 meters, this pioneering energy storage system developed by tech giant Huawei, based in south China's Shenzhen, has rewritten the rules of power delivery in extreme conditions.

Situated on the edge of the region's power grid, Ngari has a high proportion of new energy installations but a weak grid -- connected to the main grid 500 kilometers away via a single 110-kilovolt line.

A 30MW solar power project's output was previously capped at 1.5MW. Moreover, equipment cooling and operation are hampered by air pressure and thin oxygen. The innovative new battery system, notably, has stepped in where conventional power solutions have fallen short.

As an engineering breakthrough, the station does not amount to mere storage units, but rather features digital power plants capable of creating stability -- generating their own voltage and frequency signals to improve the local grid infrastructure.

Now, the project's photovoltaic output has increased from the previous maximum of 1.5MW to 12MW. ""Over 10 days of monitoring, Huawei's grid-forming energy storage maintained voltage and frequency stability through more than 40 major grid disturbances, achieving 100 percent reliability,"" said Yang Mingsheng, general manager of the project.

Nextracker, a leader in solar tracker technology, is positioning itself at the forefront of this transition. By combining advanced hardware innovation, domestic manufacturing expertise, and a circular economy partnership with SOLARCYCLE, the company is redefining how solar energy systems are built, maintained, and recycled. For investors, this strategic alignment with global decarbonization goals and supply chain reshoring trends presents a compelling growth opportunity.

The Power of Advanced Tracker Technology

Nextracker's SMART Solar Trackers are engineered to maximize energy output while minimizing environmental impact. The NX Horizon-XTR series, for instance, features terrain-following capabilities that allow solar arrays to conform to uneven landscapes without costly grading or foundation modifications. In a 328 MW Texas project, this technology reduced foundation pile lengths by 27 inches and cut steel usage by 1,928,602 lbs, slashing construction costs by millions.

The NX Horizon Hail Pro, meanwhile, addresses extreme weather risks with rapid stow mechanisms and 75-degree tilt angles, reducing insurance costs and operational downtime in hail-prone regions. Paired with Nextracker's TrueCapture software suite, which includes AI-driven Zonal Diffuse algorithms, these trackers optimize energy yield by dynamically adjusting to cloud cover and terrain variations.

Domestic Manufacturing: Securing Supply Chains

Nextracker's commitment to domestic production is a strategic response to supply chain vulnerabilities and U.S. government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). By achieving 100% U.S. domestic content compliance for trackers, the company has secured a competitive edge in the booming North American solar market.

This focus on local manufacturing has fueled revenue growth. In FY2025, Nextracker reported a 18% year-over-year revenue increase to $3 billion, with bookings surpassing 26 GW. The IRA's production tax credits and domestic content requirements are expected to further boost demand, as projects relying on federal incentives will increasingly favor U.S.-made components.

Circular Economy: Closing the Solar Lifecycle Loop

Nextracker's partnership with SOLARCYCLE, a leading solar panel recycler, addresses a critical blind spot in the renewable energy lifecycle: end-of-life panel disposal. By ensuring panels are recycled into raw materials for new systems, Nextracker reduces waste and lowers the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) over time. This closed-loop model aligns with the EU's Circular Economy Action Plan and global ESG mandates, positioning Nextracker as a sustainability leader.

Investment Thesis: Riding the Renewable Wave

Nextracker's strategic moves—advanced tech, domestic manufacturing, and circular partnerships—align perfectly with two megatrends:

1. Global Renewable Targets: The International Energy Agency projects solar capacity must grow by 40% annually through 2030 to meet climate goals. Nextracker's high-efficiency trackers are critical to achieving this scale.

2. Supply Chain Reshoring: As governments prioritize domestic production, Nextracker's IRA-compliant facilities and partnerships (e.g., the Bentek Corporation acquisition for eBOS systems) create a moat against global competitors.

Risk Considerations and Opportunities

While Nextracker's trajectory is strong, risks include solar panel oversupply in some regions and geopolitical trade disputes. However, its focus on high-value, high-margin tracker systems—versus commoditized panels—mitigates pricing pressures. Additionally, its expansion into AI-driven predictive maintenance and terrain analytics could unlock new service revenue streams.

Conclusion: A Leader in the Renewable Transition

Nextracker is not just a tracker manufacturer—it's a solutions provider for the entire solar lifecycle. With a robust order backlog ($3.4 billion as of Q1 2025) and partnerships that reduce carbon footprints, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the $1.3 trillion U.S. clean energy market under the IRA. Investors seeking exposure to a decarbonizing economy and resilient supply chains should consider Nextracker as a core holding.

Recommendation: Buy Nextracker stock with a long-term horizon. Monitor its FY2026 guidance for further upside, particularly in international markets like Australia and Latin America.

The system stands out because it could replace natural gas in industries that need extremely high temperatures. Many manufacturing facilities still burn gas because solar and wind energy cannot generate enough heat for industrial processes. NuCube provides an alternative with around-the-clock clean power.

Switching from gas to nuclear means less pollution that causes breathing problems and contributes to rising global temperatures. It also adds another option to our clean energy mix alongside solar and wind, helping maintain power even during cloudy or windless periods.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.
OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said: 'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality.","Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) has proposed key reforms to accelerate offshore wind generation following the government’s publication of its Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA).

OEUK says the decision to take a national approach to pricing will encourage more wind energy investment to help the government hit its Clean Power 2030 targets and boost growth in the critical offshore energy supply chain.

The National Energy System Operator has given 5,000 energy projects in the queue for grid connections until 29th July to submit evidence for preferential treatment.

The move is intended to prioritise 'shovel-ready' projects and scrap the first-come, first-served approach, which has allowed speculative schemes to delay viable clean energy developments.

This proposal must be matched by reforms to the Contacts for Difference (CfD) scheme and planning system to ensure the next allocation round – AR7 – delivers the scale and pace needed.

OEUK’s analysis shows that to meet the CP30 goal of 95% clean power by 2030, the UK must deliver half of this target from offshore wind. This means at least 43 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity must be installed by 2030, but current projections fall short at just 35GW. The next three CfD rounds must therefore secure an additional 20GW- equivalent to powering around 15 million homes.

Only two offshore wind generation projects – GreenVolt in Scotland and East Anglia Two – have been supported by the government’s CfD scheme since 2022.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.

Offshore wind is one of the UK’s greatest energy success stories – generating low carbon electricity at scale, creating jobs, and revitalising coastal communities.

Fixed-bottom turbines, with so-called monopiles attached to the seabed in shallower waters, have driven the UK’s rapid growth of wind energy generation to date but floating wind turbines using newer technologies, can be anchored in deeper waters with stronger wind resources, opening new areas for development.

They also have fewer environmental constraints than fixed-bottom projects and can progress more smoothly through the consenting process.

Speed and clarity to reform grid access and a more transparent approach with equal treatment for fixed and floating wind farms would give developers and the supply chain greater confidence to invest.

OEUK’s key recommendations for AR7 and beyond:

• Support for offshore wind: Provide assurance that sufficient funding is available for both fixed and commercial floating wind projects over the next three years, including projects to decarbonise offshore oil and gas operations, strengthen the UK supply chain, and create export opportunities.

• Grid and consent reform: Improved risk sharing between developers and grid network operators plus increased administrative capacity and streamlined planning to reduce delays to grid connection. Compensation should be offered for unexpected hold ups.

• Eligibility and investment: Reform eligibility criteria to allow both fixed and floating wind projects that have not received full consent to bid in the auction, extend CfD contracts from 15 to 20 years and introduce a well-balance cap and floor to transmission charges to improve investor confidence, lower subsidies and reduce costs to consumers. Introduce a well-balanced cap and floor to transmission charges.

OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said:

'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality. That means enabling floating wind to compete on equal footing, unlocking grid access, and giving developers the confidence to invest at scale.

'We’re calling for clear eligibility rules that allow well-progressed but unconsented projects to bid, longer CfD terms to reduce costs to consumers, and a firm commitment to grid and consenting reform – including compensation for delays. These are the changes our members need to deliver the next 20GW.

'At the same time, we are working with our members to reduce project risk and borrowing costs as well as improving contractual relationships and promoting standardisation of modular wind turbine components to make them cheaper and faster to install.

'There is only one energy supply chain for offshore wind and oil and gas – and it cannot be allowed to decline. With the right reforms and a pragmatic energy strategy which supports homegrown oil and gas alongside the acceleration of UK renewables, the North Sea can remain a global energy powerhouse, supporting economic growth, jobs, and our climate goals.'

ScotWind: OEUK supports the ambition of the ScotWind leasing round and is calling for clarity on delivery timelines, grid access, and supply chain investment to ensure projects can rapidly move forward.

INTOG: OEUK backs INTOG schemes using wind energy to decarbonise offshore oil and gas production. We are urging government and regulators to ensure these projects are prioritised for grid access and CfD eligibility, and that planning processes reflect their dual role in emissions reduction and clean power generation.

Celtic Sea Round 5 of Celtic Sea wind auctions held last month (June) aims to unlock the potential for floating offshore wind off the coasts of South Wales and Southwest England. The Crown Estate has selected Equinor and Gwynt Glas to develop two 1.5GW floating wind farms. The leases come with grid connections already approved, but only two out of three leases on offer have been taken up.

TNUoS: Transmission Network Use of System Charges. Transmission has a cost which is paid by the generator and the user which appears in electricity bills. This cost is expected to increase dramatically in future years as more energy is brought from Scotland to England. The connection cost for the generator rises for remote areas but in heavily populated areas generators are paid to connect. The price difference must be adjusted with a proposed cap and floor system that would introduce an upper maximum cost to Scottish projects.

Review of electricity market arrangements (REMA): The government is still to announce the full outcome of its REMA consultation beyond the already published decision on zonal pricing. OEUK is calling for introduction of ‘deemed contracts for difference’ (based on potential, not actual output). This would mean wind energy producers being paid according to their potential capacity in a system that would give producers the opportunity to benefit from high global wind energy prices when they are available and keep a proportion of the additional profits

In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.","One of the drivers of these disruptions in the electricity market has been the EPA’s regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. This has been the case with its carbon rule, which would have shut down the nation’s fleet of coal power plants despite warnings from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation that more than half of the United States is at risk for electricity shortages over the next five years.

The risk of electricity shortages is being fueled by the explosion in electricity demand from artificial intelligence and the new data centers required to power this technology. An Energy Department report found that the amount of U.S. electricity consumed by data centers is expected to jump from 4.4% in 2023 to between 6.7% and 12% by 2028.

While electricity providers and grid operators have been talking about how to prepare for this massive demand spike, EPA regulations have made their job even more challenging. For example, the carbon rule would have illegally forced utilities to either shift generations away from coal, install expensive and unproven technology on existing coal plants, or shut the plants down altogether. Already, more than 120 coal units across 32 states are now scheduled to shut down within the next five years, unless steps are taken to stop these retirements. The carbon rule would have made matters even worse.

The goal of the Biden carbon rule was to make the U.S. reliant on wind and solar power, but such a dramatic transition carries heavy risks to the reliability of our grid.

We can look to the recent blackouts in Europe as a warning for us here in our country. For example, Spain has pursued aggressive policies to transition its grid to renewables. On April 16, the country boasted that for the first time, and for just a few minutes, renewables were delivering 100% of the nation’s electricity. Just 12 days later, a grid failure led to a prolonged blackout that plunged the country into darkness for days.

Solar and wind are intermittent sources of electricity because they, unlike coal, lack the capabilities necessary to serve as baseload sources of power capable of meeting demand at all hours and in all weather conditions. And it is reliable, dispatchable power that will be required to meet the demands of data centers, which operate 24/7.

In addition to hurting our nation’s electric reliability, the Biden-era carbon rule also undermines our national security. While premature coal retirements shrink America’s power supply, China is rapidly building new coal plants to strengthen its grid and expand its economy.

WHY THE KREMLIN HAS DELEGATED ITS TRUMP REBUKES TO STATE MEDIA

China, which already has the world’s largest coal fleet, plans to build another 420,000 megawatts of coal power. With these additions, China’s coal fleet will be almost 10 times larger than that of the U.S. Coal’s resurgence in China and other countries including India underscores how taking America’s coal fleet offline would make little impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. Today, the U.S. power sector is responsible for just 3% of global carbon emissions.

The growth of AI and other advanced technologies will require the U.S. to build new sources of electricity generation, but at a minimum, we need to stop needlessly retiring our existing coal fleet. In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited.
Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two.
Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel.
The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species.","EV battery cooling tech has come pretty far in the last 30 years. The GM EV1, for instance, was reengineered in 1999 with an air tunnel to properly cool its optional nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, but it still couldn't be sold in Arizona because the battery still got too hot. Now, however, we have advanced cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch-style lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with liquid cooling (typically ethylene glycol, a.k.a. antifreeze) and active air solutions to handle environmental extremes — even in Arizona.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited. Active air cooling employs fans or chilled air from the HVAC system, and is still the method used by the Lexus UX300e, though indirect liquid cooling can better tackle current EV power levels. Direct liquid cooling isn't used for consumer EVs because the batteries would need to make, well, direct contact with a liquid, and it would need to have zero electrical conductivity to avoid shorting the battery.

Most EVs use cold plates (also called cooling plates), which feature coolant passages strewn through a flat sheet of metal adhered directly to the bottoms of battery cells. Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two. Rivian, Hyundai, Ford, GM, and Lucid all use cold plates. Tesla, on the other hand, routes coolant pipes throughout the cells, which may be done so that its 4680 batteries can vent from the bottom in case of thermal runaway, or to be different and make this article longer.

Tesla's battery cooling has undergone quite a few revisions to improve temperature regulation of its cylindrical cells. In the Model S P85D, one coolant path chills 444 cells. The problem is that coolant gets quite warm by the end of its journey, especially given how many cells it must handle. So, for the P100D, Tesla switched to two paths that each cool 258 cells. In the Model S Plaid, 11 individual coolant pipes are responsible for just 144 cells each. Coolant passages also changed from being relatively straight up to 2017, meaning they contacted a small portion of each cell's side, to serpentine in 2018, dramatically improving the contact patch.

While Tesla has refined intra-cell piping, cold plates have two big advantages. First, cold plates allow the battery to have more cells packed horizontally. Second, as Peter Rawlinson of Lucid told Auto Evolution, cold plates in the remarkably quick Lucid Air Sapphire cool the battery more efficiently since they contact the bottom of the cell, or the anode, where much of the heat builds up. Either way, temperature monitoring ensures the battery stays in a safe, usable range.

Each automaker employs cold plates in its own way. Lucid uses a super-thin layer of adhesive to join the cells to each cold plate for the best possible thermal conductivity, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 uses a comparatively thick adhesive that results in more distance between the cells and the plate. However, the Ioniq 5 also uses one massive cold plate rather than individual plates for each battery pack. Rivian uses cold plates too, but sandwiches them between the cells to cool two layers at once.

The Hummer EV, a vehicle larger than some buildings, places cold plates on top of individual battery packs in a gargantuan steel enclosure. These cold plates can become hot plates, warming the battery to the optimal temperature range when entering Watts To Freedom (WTF) mode, unlocking the full 1,000 hp. The Hummer's heat pump also chills the motors for peak efficiency.

Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel. Not only is aluminum lighter, but it's more efficient at dissipating heat. Of course, the Hummer EV 3X doesn't care about the weight of steel because it makes 1,000 hp and a ridiculous 11,500 lb-ft of torque, if you listen to marketing, or a more realistic but still insane 1,000 to 1,100 lb-ft (if you go by Road & Track and Autoweek's reporting).

If a Hummer EV is like winning the torque Powerball, an extended range Ford F-150 Lightning at 580 hp and 775 lb-ft is still like winning a $500 a week for life scratch-off. Incredible, but not quite in the same power ballpark. Plus, if Hummers have to heat the battery in WTF mode anyway, steel's thermal properties might be irrelevant. Strange how the Hummer EV is the least efficient EV you can buy.

The huge variety of cooling solutions is mind-boggling, and detailing every system would result in a Dostoyevsky-length novel. The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species. Still, like Galapagos finch beaks, there's still plenty of micro-evolution happening, like GM's U-shaped prismatic batteries, and we have yet to see which changes help EVs adapt to our world the best.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/how-electric-vehicles-like-teslas-fords-gms-keep-batteries-cool/l-intro-1752183144.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:05.545757

Recent research suggests that natural hydrogen, continuously produced by the Earth’s crust, could power our planet for an astounding 170,000 years. This immense potential transforms the conversation around energy transitions, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a future powered by a resource that has been quietly accumulating for millions, if not billions, of years. But what is the reality of accessing this hidden treasure?

An Abundant Yet Largely Untapped Gas

Hydrogen today is pivotal in various industrial applications, such as ammonia and methanol production. It’s also heralded as a clean energy carrier, with the potential to power vehicles and energy grids. However, most of this hydrogen is derived from hydrocarbons, which emit greenhouse gases during production. Natural hydrogen, in contrast, forms without human intervention through geochemical reactions between specific rocks and water, emitting no carbon and requiring no external energy input. This naturally occurring hydrogen can remain trapped underground for thousands of years, creating potentially exploitable reserves.

While these reserves were once thought rare, recent studies indicate they might be widespread if we know where to look. This revelation could significantly alter our approach to clean energy, as natural hydrogen represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional energy sources.

“This Reactor Is a Game-Changer for America”: US Launches World’s First Nuclear Plant Producing Hydrogen, Triggering a New Era in Clean Energy

The Three Key Conditions for Deposit Formation

According to geochemist Chris Ballentine and his team, creating a natural hydrogen deposit depends on three critical elements: a production source, a reservoir for gas storage, and a geological barrier to trap it. Production typically results from geochemical processes, with the most common being the reaction of iron or magnesium-rich rocks with water, continuously releasing hydrogen underground.

The reservoir must be sufficiently porous to store hydrogen, while the cap rock, often composed of clays or salts, must prevent the gas from escaping. These criteria, familiar in the oil and gas industry, can now be applied to hydrogen exploration, opening new avenues for sustainable energy sourcing. Understanding these geological conditions is essential for identifying viable hydrogen reserves.

Promising Geological Regions

Certain geological formations are particularly conducive to hydrogen accumulation. These include ophiolites, which are ancient oceanic floors lifted to the surface, igneous provinces with volcanic rock, and ancient greenstone belts, some over three billion years old.

In the United States, attention is focused on Kansas, where an old rift zone rich in basalts may contain significant hydrogen reserves. In Albania, a vast reservoir has been identified within an ophiolite complex. These discoveries are attracting industrial interest from companies like Koloma, backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, and others like Hy-Terra and Snowfox, supported by major energy corporations.

“This Changes Everything Overnight”: New US Fuel Cell Simultaneously Generates Power, Stores Massive Energy, and Delivers Clean Hydrogen Without Compromise

A Parameter Not to Overlook: Bacteria

Despite the potential abundance of underground hydrogen, its exploitation is not guaranteed. Subsurface bacteria that consume hydrogen can significantly reduce available volumes. According to researcher Barbara Sherwood Lollar, environments conducive to these microorganisms are less promising for exploration. Understanding and mitigating this biological factor is crucial for assessing the true potential of natural hydrogen deposits.

A Roadmap for Exploration

The study offers a comprehensive synthesis of hydrogen formation and accumulation mechanisms, providing geologists and energy companies with a clear roadmap for exploration. It guides exploration campaigns toward areas most likely to contain economically viable deposits.

While uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the extractable quantity of natural hydrogen, the prospects are immense. An abundant, naturally renewing, clean resource already stored underground could make natural hydrogen a central player in the energy transition over the coming decades. What new developments will unfold as we continue to explore this untapped energy frontier?

For investors, the sector presents compelling opportunities in energy-efficient EV manufacturing and supply chains aligned with the government's priorities—provided risks like regulatory delays and cost volatility are managed.","The UK's automotive sector is undergoing a seismic shift, propelled by the government's £2.5bn DRIVE35 initiative and a suite of trade deals aimed at reclaiming its position as a global leader in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) manufacturing. While the program promises to unlock £50bn in economic potential by 2030, investors must navigate a complex landscape of subsidies, energy costs, and regulatory hurdles to capitalize on emerging opportunities. This analysis dissects the strategic advantages and risks tied to the sector's transformation, offering actionable insights for investors.

Funding the Transition: Targeting Pain Points with Precision

The DRIVE35 program allocates £2bn for R&D in automotive and related sectors by 2030, alongside an additional £500m for scale-up grants (up to £20m per project). This funding directly addresses three critical pain points:

1. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: By prioritizing battery production, gigafactories, and green hydrogen infrastructure, the UK aims to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.

2. Private Investment Gaps: The £6.6bn target for private capital underscores the government's role in de-risking projects like battery manufacturing and software-defined vehicles.

3. Competitiveness: Scale-up grants for EV technologies (e.g., vehicle-to-grid systems) position UK firms to dominate emerging markets.

The program's focus on sectors like EV charging infrastructure (£400m allocated) and defense-aligned dual-use tech also creates niches for specialized firms.

Trade Deals: A Competitive Edge, but Not Without Hurdles

Recent trade agreements have slashed tariffs and expanded markets:

- UK-US Deal: Tariffs on cars exported to the US fell from 27.5% to 10%, benefiting luxury brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin.

- India Deal: A 100% tariff reduction to 10% opens a booming market for high-end vehicles.

- CPTPP Access: Entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership grants access to £12tn in markets, though automotive specifics remain under negotiation.

However, the EU-UK “reset” remains incomplete. Rules of origin ambiguities and lingering customs delays could undermine the 80% of UK car exports that still rely on EU supply chains.

The Energy Cost Conundrum: A Make-or-Break Factor

High energy prices threaten to negate the sector's potential. UK manufacturers pay up to four times more for electricity than US competitors, with battery producers in Scotland facing costs 20% higher than in Germany. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme aims to reduce industrial electricity costs by £35–40/MWh, but its narrow focus on battery production—excluding broader automotive manufacturing—leaves critical gaps.

Without extending relief to the entire sector, the UK risks losing investment to lower-cost regions like Spain or Poland.

EV Market Challenges: Lagging Demand and Policy Uncertainty

Despite £6.5bn in industry investments to boost EV adoption, sales fell 12.8% in early 2025, underscoring the need for urgent reforms:

- Tax Incentives: The Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and Expensive Car Supplement (ECS) penalize EV buyers, costing the sector £360m annually.

- Regulatory Volatility: Past reversals on ZEV mandates have eroded industry confidence. SMMT estimates that halving EV VAT could shift 2m sales to electric by 2030.

The 2030 ICE phaseout remains at risk unless policies align with consumer affordability and charging infrastructure.

Unlocking the £50bn Potential: The Path Forward

To realize this economic ambition, the UK must:

1. Accelerate Energy Cost Reforms: Extend the competitiveness scheme to all automotive manufacturers, not just battery producers.

2. Fix the Tax Code: Remove punitive levies like the ECS and reinstate EV purchase incentives.

3. Streamline Regulation: Finalize the Subsidy Advice Unit's review of DRIVE35 grants (due August 2025) and align EU battery recycling rules to avoid trade barriers.

4. Invest in Skills: Scale up apprenticeships and visas for tech talent in AI and engineering.

Investment Strategy: Where to Focus

Opportunities to Watch:

- Battery Manufacturers: Companies like Britishvolt or those partnering with gigafactories (e.g., Tata's £1bn Somerset plant) stand to benefit from £5.8bn allocated to energy storage.

- EV Charging Infrastructure: Firms like EO Charging or Pivot Power, which operate nationwide networks, are critical to meeting the £1.4bn EV uptake goal.

- Software-Defined Vehicles: Startups developing autonomous driving or V2G tech may attract DRIVE35 grants.

Risks to Monitor:

- Energy Cost Delays: A failure to address Scotland's high tariffs or extend reforms could trigger capital flight.

- Policy Inconsistency: Fluctuating ZEV mandates or EU trade disputes could disrupt supply chains.

- Global Competition: China's dominance (31% of global vehicle output) and U.S. subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act require agility.

Conclusion: A High-Reward, High-Risk Journey

The DRIVE35 program and trade deals offer a clear roadmap for the UK to become a ZEV manufacturing powerhouse. Yet success hinges on resolving energy cost disparities, stabilizing policy frameworks, and accelerating EV adoption. For investors, the sector presents compelling opportunities in energy-efficient EV manufacturing and supply chains aligned with the government's priorities—provided risks like regulatory delays and cost volatility are managed.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:20.818869

Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours.
Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.","A summer of blackouts in Yucatán will extend into Monday as the Federal Electricity Commission schedules power cuts for 16 coastal communities. The planned blackouts will run from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., though CFE said the work might take less than eight hours.

Temperatures along the coast are expected to reach almost 90°F / 32°C under sunny skies. Residents will be relying on Gulf breezes to stay cool.

The scheduled blackouts affect Progreso and surrounding areas. CFE said the work connects a new substation and modernizes the electrical system in response to ongoing power cuts that have plagued the region.

The announcement follows weeks of unplanned blackouts across Yucatán. Some neighborhoods in Mérida and Campeche have experienced frequent and prolonged power failures, leaving residents without electricity, clean water, or basic services. In southern Mérida, residents of the Zazil-Há and Cinco Colonias neighborhoods have endured constant Yucatán blackouts for two weeks, lasting several hours at a time.

Blackouts in Yucatán Follow Regional Pattern

Yucatán’s frequent blackouts, brownouts and appliance-killing power surges reflect chronic electrical infrastructure challenges that stretch back years. In May 2024, blackouts hit 21 of Mexico’s 32 states, forcing the National Energy Control Center to declare emergency conditions multiple times. Blackouts in Yucatán weren’t spared from the national crisis.

The CFE electrical network is stressed due to excessive demand for supply to mitigate the extreme heat that prevails during Yucatán blackouts. Local experts say the blackouts in Yucatán require long-term fixes. Dr. Rubén Domínguez Maldonado from Anáhuac Mayab University told reporters that without scheduled blackouts, heat damage to lines and transformers would create more expensive repairs and longer Yucatán blackouts.

Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours. The persistent have pushed some communities to protest. Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.

Political Response Draws Criticism

President Claudia Sheinbaum’s June visit to Yucatán sparked controversy over her comments about the blackouts in Yucatán. She declared that “the opposition’s campaign about the lack of electricity in Yucatán is not in line with reality, since there is sufficient infrastructure.”

Her statement contrasted sharply with residents’ experiences of Yucatán blackouts. In communities like Cheumán, families with babies struggle to store milk and food for their children during extended blackouts in Yucatán. Local researcher Gina Villagómez Valdés documented cases where residents have been without power for days, with blackouts damaging their electrical appliances.

CFE has announced multiple infrastructure projects over the years to address blackouts in Yucatán with mixed results. In 2019, President López Obrador promised a new power plant during a Yucatan tour, declaring it would ensure “there will never be any blackouts” in the state. However, energy sector experts noted that this promised plant was not part of CFE’s strategic plan to address Yucatán’s frequent power failures.

CFE has invested over 151 billion pesos to improve energy supply and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, including plans for two combined-cycle power plants in Mérida and Valladolid. The plants were originally scheduled to begin operations by summer 2024 to help end Yucatán blackouts, but delays pushed timelines into the future.

The Yucatán state government now works with CFE on a plan to eliminate blackouts by 2027 and achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2030. Governor Joaquín Díaz Mena acknowledged that “Yucatán is facing a complex energy situation, especially during this season of extreme heat” that contributes to blackouts in Yucatán.

National Investment Plans Target Blackouts

The Mexican government presented a National Strategy for the Electricity Sector 2024-2030, planning to invest $23 billion in CFE to address nationwide power issues including Yucatán blackouts. CFE’s 2025-2030 plan includes 12 new power plants with combined capacity of 5,840MW across nine states. However, Yucatán isn’t among the states getting new generation facilities to directly combat blackouts in Yucatán.

To prepare for increased demand during summer 2025 and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, capacitor banks will be installed in seven substations in northern Quintana Roo, representing an investment of 194.39 million pesos ($9.32 million).

Beyond generation capacity, Yucatán blackouts stem from fundamental infrastructure problems. Aging infrastructure and “a mess of ancient wiring” continues to cause blackouts in Yucatán, with haphazardly installed power, telephone, and fiber optic lines characterizing most streets. CFE employees revealed that Yucatán blackouts during the hot season are inevitable due to overloaded connections in new subdivisions.

The communities affected by Monday’s scheduled blackouts include Progreso, Chelem, Chicxulub Puerto, Chuburná Puerto, Dzidzilché, San Ignacio, Misné Balam, Flamboyanes, Santa María Chí, Tamanché, Cosgaya, Komchén, Suytunchén, Kikteil, Xcunyá and Sierra Papacal.

CFE Director General Emilia Esther Calleja Alor recently visited the state and pledged to provide advance notice of future scheduled blackouts to help residents prepare for planned Yucatán blackouts. The commission emphasized these actions “seek to improve the energy infrastructure for the benefit of residents” and businesses in the coastal area affected by recurring blackouts in Yucatán.

For international visitors and residents, the ongoing Yucatán blackouts represent a significant infrastructure concern in a region that depends heavily on tourism and economic development. The peninsula covers roughly 70,000 square miles (181,000 square kilometers) and includes popular destinations like Cancún, Mérida, and the Riviera Maya, all affected by periodic blackouts.",https://yucatanmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CFEexpensive.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:22:44.318149

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications.
The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.
Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities.
The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners.","For years, Wabanaki tribal communities faced a costly dilemma: pay outside contractors $500 to $1,000 per home for energy audits, or go without services that could slash utility bills for hundreds of tribal members.

Now, the federally recognized tribes in Maine are trying a different approach. They’re training their own members as energy auditors and heat-pump technicians, creating immediate cost savings and long-term career pathways that keep energy dollars flowing within the tribal communities.

“We don't want to go outside of the nations to get these services,” Kelsey Flores, coordinator of the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team, told Tribal Business News. “The overall goal is to feed into our resilience and our self-sufficiency.”

The workforce development strategy represents a shift toward self-sufficiency that has become even more urgent after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded a $1.1 million grant in May that supported the tribes’ renewable energy programs.

The effort is led by the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team. The team is composed of representatives from four Native nations: the Penobscot Nation; the Passamaquoddy Tribe (with communities at Pleasant Point and Indian Township); the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians; and the Mi'kmaq Nation. The team also includes partners at the University of Maine.

The team is now offering two energy-related workforce development programs: energy audit training available free to members of the Penobscot Nation, and a three-week pre-apprenticeship program on heat pump installation for up to 20 members of the Wabanaki tribes.

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications. The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Training costs are covered by the Penobscot Nation, and applications are still being accepted for the program through reaching out to Flores or by contacting Build Green Maine directly through their website.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Participants in the program can reduce their home energy consumption by 25% and successful business owners could potentially audit hundreds of homes, Callas told Tribal Business News.

“There’s a couple of different degrees of accomplishment here,” Callas said. “When people come through and do training like ours, they often look around their own house and make changes, at the very least. Some people go on to be entrepreneurs, who will run with this and make it a business to provide this service for other people, or help contractors looking to install things like insulation and sealing.”

The heat pump training takes a different approach, focusing on construction trades and union careers. The three-week pre-apprenticeship program is open to Wabanaki tribal members or descendants who have a high school diploma or equivalent and a valid driver's license, according to Sam Boss, apprenticeship and workforce development director for the Maine chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The program covers lodging, tuition and up to $150 in gas cards for selected trainees.

Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities. The program will train 20 people from across the Wabanaki nations, and applications are still being accepted through Flores with an Aug. 4 deadline.

Boss said the program prepares participants for union apprenticeships that offer paid training, benefits, healthcare and pensions.

“Usually, these pre apprenticeship programs are considered a first step on your pathway to getting into a registered apprenticeship with a union,” Boss told Tribal Business News. “[Those apprenticeships] are a great pathway into the trades, because you're not going into debt, you're getting benefits, great health care and a pension.”

Heat pumps have become increasingly popular in Maine, which has installed more than 100,000 of the energy efficient devices over the past decade — three times the national average, according to Bloomberg. The state’s push toward heat pump adoption has created growing demand for skilled installers.

The workforce programs are moving forward in this growing market, despite losing a primary funding source. Community action grants through the state of Maine have enabled Flores to stay in her position as coordinator and supported the energy audit training. The AFL-CIO partnership has enabled the August 11-29 heat pump training session to continue.

The University of Maine is pursuing a legal dispute to try to recover the EPA funding, according to Flores.

The funding loss highlighted the vulnerability of federal support and reinforced the need for economic strategies that don't depend on government programs, Flores said.

""It's really unfortunate to see how easy it is to strip away crucial funding that was set to positively impact these communities that have been historically underserved,"" Flores said.

But the setback hasn't derailed the long-term vision. The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners. The ultimate goal is creating tribally-owned businesses in the green energy sector that can serve both tribal and broader markets.

“The Wabanaki Nations have always been and will always be resilient, so their energy, visions and goals will remain the same,” Flores said. “We are more than open to expanding our network, solidifying our partnerships, and really working with any partner that is willing to support these projects.”

His comments contained false and misleading information about the use of wind power in the U.S. and around the world, and came on the heels of an executive order he signed Monday that would end subsidies around ""green"" energy, reports The Associated Press.

Here's a look at the facts.

CLAIM: ""Wind is a very expensive form of energy.""

THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce electricity around US$30 per megawatt hour. This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Onshore wind farms cost less to build and operate than natural gas plants on average in most regions of the U.S., even without tax credits. Though-gas plants are available to produce electricity at any time of the day, unlike wind. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, according to the EIA.

While electricity rates have risen across the U.S. over the past decade, states that have added a significant amount of onshore wind power, such as Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have kept rates from rising as fast as other states, said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation. For example, the share of electricity generated from wind in Iowa increased from 15% in 2010 to nearly 60% of the state's electricity generation in 2023, while the state's electricity rates grew at a rate slower than that of 42 other states, his research found.

Wind power can be expensive if it's built where winds are weaker, but the United States is adding it in places with strong wind resources, he added.

""Wind should be seen as part of an overall portfolio of electricity system resources and is an important part of keeping costs down,"" he said Wednesday.

Trump has committed to increasing U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels. He signed an executive order Monday aimed at phasing out tax credits for wind and solar facilities.

CLAIM: Wind turbines are ""almost exclusively"" made in China, but President Xi Jinping told Trump they have ""very, very few.""

THE FACTS: China is the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines, producing more than half of the supply. It is also installing them in China at a record pace. In total, China has 1.3 terawatts of utility-scale wind and solar capacity in development, which could generate more electricity than neighbouring Japan consumed in all of 2023, according to a report from the Global Energy Monitor released Wednesday. The report highlighted China's offshore wind development, calling China the undisputed leader in the offshore wind sector, though it also said coal and gas are still on the rise across China.

""The whole narrative that we're led to believe in the West is that China is building coal plants and that it's doing nothing for its carbon footprint,"" Tom Harper, partner at the global consultant Baringa, said Tuesday. ""So the surprising thing is China is building a portfolio of zero-carbon resources that are designed to not perfectly complement each other, but to work alongside each other to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.""

CLAIM: ""If you look at smart countries, they don't use it.""

THE FACTS: At least 136 countries and territories around the world use wind power to generate electricity, according to the EIA, with many countries growing the amount they produce. The top five markets for wind power in 2024 were China, the U.S., Brazil, India and Germany, while Uzbekistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia represent the next wave of wind energy growth, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Council CEO Ben Backwell said 2024 marked yet another record year for wind energy growth, with the ""industry increasingly pushing into new regions.""

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, disputed the idea that smart countries don't use wind power. China is soaring ahead in building a massive amount of wind power while Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Sweden, France and many other countries in Europe have large programs of wind construction, he said Wednesday.

""By cutting back on wind power development, the U.S. is ceding the lead to China in this important technology, and killing a lot of U.S. jobs,"" Gerrard said in an e-mail.

CLAIM: In New England, two whales washed up over 50 years, ""and last summer they had 14 washed up. Now, I'm not saying that's the wind farm that was built, that maybe it is right.""

THE FACTS: There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA says it analyzes the causes of death whenever possible, following the science and data. Unfounded claims about offshore wind threatening whales have surfaced as a flashpoint in the fight over the future of renewable energy.

The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm officially opened in 2024 east of Montauk Point, New York. The nation's second-largest offshore wind farm is under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. A five-turbine pilot project has been operating since 2016 off the coast of Rhode Island.

CLAIM: ""The birds are dying all over the place.""

THE FACTS: Turbines, like all infrastructure, can pose a risk to birds. However, the National Audubon Society, which is dedicated to the conservation of birds, thinks developers can manage these risks and climate change is a greater threat. An Audubon report found that two-thirds of North American bird species could face extinction due to rising temperatures.

In January, the nonprofit said responsible offshore wind development is a clear win for birds, the U.S. economy and the climate.

""While persistent myths claim widespread and devastating effects of offshore wind turbines on wildlife, the science tells a different story. Our findings clearly indicate that we can responsibly deploy offshore wind in a manner that still protects birds and their habitats,"" Sam Wojcicki, Audubon's senior director for climate policy, wrote in a January post. The organization also supports wind energy on land when it is sited and operated properly to minimize the impact on birds and other wildlife.

CLAIM: ""You can't take them down because the environmentalists don't let you bury the blades.""

THE FACTS: Wind turbine blades are challenging to recycle. They are designed for durability to withstand hurricane-force winds. However, the U.S. already has the ability to recycle most wind turbine materials, according to the Department of Energy. It issued a report in January that found 90% of wind turbines can be recycled using existing infrastructure, while new strategies and innovative recycling methods will be needed to tackle the rest.

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue. Danish wind energy developer rsted committed in 2021 to never sending turbine blades to landfill, instead reusing, recycling or otherwise recovering them.

The Japanese automakerNissan Raises $4.5 Billion to Ease Debt Pressure as EV Plans Slow Down has secured $4.5 billion through a fresh bond sale in U.S. dollars and euros, aiming to buy itself time and space to manage a growing pile of debt.

The funds will help Nissan refinance around ¥700 billion (roughly $4.76 billion) in debt due this fiscal year. It’s a necessary move for a company that’s facing rising costs, a tougher EV market, and a recent downgrade to “junk” status by all three major credit agencies.

Borrowing Now, Breathing Room Later

According to a term sheet seen by Reuters, Nissan issued three dollar-denominated bond tranches worth $3 billion, alongside two euro tranches totaling €1.3 billion ($1.52 billion). The bonds stretch over four to ten years, with interest rates between 7.5% and 8.125% — higher than usual, but expected for a company under pressure.

For Nissan, this isn’t just about numbers, it’s about regaining financial footing after a few difficult years.

EV Plans Postponed as Caution Sets In

Nissan’s ambitions in the electric vehicle space are being quietly scaled back, especially in North America. Two new electric SUVs, one for Nissan, the other for its luxury brand Infiniti — were supposed to roll out of its Mississippi plant by 2028. That timeline has now slipped to late 2028 or even 2029.

It’s a reflection of the bigger picture: EV demand isn’t as hot as it once seemed. Policy shifts in the U.S., especially the rollback of key tax credits and the introduction of a 25% tariff on vehicle exports to Canada, are making things even more complicated. In response, Nissan has pulled two EVs from its U.S. lineup and halted Canadian shipments altogether.

Holding Tight to Cash

To conserve money, Nissan has reportedly asked some of its suppliers to delay payments — a tough ask that hints at internal cash flow concerns. At the same time, its battery partner AESC has paused work on a new factory in South Carolina. That site was meant to support Nissan’s EV production, but with plans now in flux, the construction has been put on hold.

These choices aren’t easy, but they show a company trying to stay afloat while recalibrating its path forward.

Investors Still Hopeful, For Now

Interestingly, retail investors are staying optimistic. Social platform Stocktwits reported a spike in discussions about Nissan, with sentiment labeled “bullish” and message volume marked “extremely high.” Whether this is grounded in confidence or just speculation remains to be seen.

A Company at the Crossroads

Nissan’s story right now is about survival but also resilience. It’s juggling short-term financial fixes while rewriting long-term plans in a shifting industry. The $4.5 billion it just raised doesn’t solve everything, but it gives the automaker breathing room to regroup.

With AI-driven energy demands surging and hydrogen poised to become a cornerstone of the energy transition, Bloom's strategic moves in 2025 underscore its ambition to dominate both markets. However, the path is not without hurdles, including tariff pressures and competition from legacy energy systems.

Growth Engine #1: Fuel Cells for Data Centers – A Scalable Solution for AI's Appetite

Data centers are the unsung power hogs of the digital age, and their energy needs are exploding as AI workloads grow. Bloom's solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer a compelling alternative to grid-dependent power. Key advantages include:

- High Power Density: Up to 100 MW per acre, making them ideal for dense AI infrastructure.

- Reliability: 99.999% uptime (6-9s reliability), critical for mission-critical data centers.

- Emissions Reduction: 34% lower CO₂ emissions than grid power, with near-zero SOx/NOx.

A landmark partnership with American Electric Power (AEP) highlights Bloom's scalability. The 1 GW procurement agreement, with an initial 100 MW order, addresses the urgent need for reliable, low-carbon power in AI hubs. This deal alone could generate over $500 million in revenue by 2026, assuming $0.5/W pricing.

Growth Engine #2: Hydrogen Electrolyzers – The Key to Green Hydrogen's Rise

Bloom's electrolyzers, which split water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy, are central to its vision of a decarbonized economy. The Bloom Electrolyzer™ boasts:

- Industry-Leading Efficiency: 37.5 kWh per kilogram of hydrogen, 20-25% better than PEM or alkaline systems.

- Speed to Deploy: A 4 MW unit at NASA's Ames Research Center was operational in two months, producing 2.4 metric tons of hydrogen daily.

- Cost Advantages: A 28% learning rate (vs. 13% for PEM) drives down the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), making green hydrogen viable faster.

The 80 MW project in South Korea with SK Eternix—a world-first for solid oxide electrolyzers—demonstrates Bloom's global reach. By 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects hydrogen could supply 12% of global energy demand. Bloom is well-positioned to capture this growth, especially as governments like the EU and the U.S. (via the Inflation Reduction Act) offer tax incentives for green hydrogen infrastructure.

Navigating Tariff Challenges and Competitive Pressures

Bloom isn't without risks. JPMorgan warns that tariffs could shave up to 100 basis points off its gross margins, though the company mitigates this by:

- Diversifying Supply Chains: U.S.-based manufacturing and global sourcing from non-Chinese suppliers.

- Leveraging Tax Credits: The Inflation Reduction Act's $48 billion in federal tax credits reduces customer costs, making Bloom's systems more competitive than gas turbines.

Competitors like gas turbine providers face headwinds: higher operational costs, longer lead times (18–24 months), and compliance risks. Bloom's modular systems, deployable in weeks, undercut these disadvantages.

Financials and Catalysts: A Turnaround in Motion

Bloom's Q1 2025 results were stellar:

- Revenue: $326 million (+39% YoY), a record for the quarter.

- Margins: Gross margins improved to 28.7%, up from 17.5% in Q1 2024.

- Operating Income: $13.2 million (vs. -$30.7 million in Q1 2024).

The company forecasts $1.65–$1.85 billion in 2025 revenue, with 2026 poised for a margin boost as IRA tax credits kick in. However, debt ($2.01 billion in liabilities) remains a concern. Bloom's $794.8 million cash reserves and convertible bonds maturing in 2028 provide a buffer, but refinancing will be critical.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, but Watch the Risks

Bloom Energy presents a compelling long-term opportunity for investors willing to tolerate volatility. Its dual growth engines—data center fuel cells and hydrogen electrolyzers—are aligned with two of the clean energy transition's most urgent needs. Key catalysts in 2025 include:

1. Q2 2025 Earnings: Strong bookings in AI data centers and industrial sectors would validate demand.

2. Hydrogen Partnerships: Announcements of government or corporate contracts could solidify Bloom's leadership.

3. IRA Tax Credit Realization: Margins could jump 5-10% in 2026 as credits take effect.

Risks to Consider

Execution Risks: Supply chain delays or leadership instability (post-CFO transition) could disrupt timelines.

Macroeconomic Sensitivity: The stock's beta of 3.28 means it's highly reactive to market swings.

Competitor Adaptation: Cheaper battery storage or rival electrolyzer tech could erode margins.

Final Take

Bloom Energy is a buy for investors with a 3–5 year horizon. Its technological edge, tax-advantaged projects, and scalable solutions for data centers and hydrogen make it a critical player in the clean energy transition. While near-term risks like debt and volatility persist, the long-term tailwinds of decarbonization and AI's energy demands position Bloom to deliver outsized returns.

Investment Grade: Buy (Medium-High Risk)

Target Price: $20–$25 by 2026, assuming revenue growth and margin expansion.

Stay tuned for Q2 earnings and hydrogen partnership updates—these could be the next catalysts to watch.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:35.972247
