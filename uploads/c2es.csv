,Texas Environment,2026-01-04 10:03:41+00:00,Inside Climate News,"The Real Pain of Climate Change Is Easy to Feel, but Increasingly Difficult to Study","Chad Small, Teresa Tomassoni",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04012026/chronic-pain-and-climate-change/,"Chronic pain both vividly colors and darkens the everyday experience of those who suffer it, according to Barbarin, a disability advocate.
Half a trillion dollars are spent annually on chronic pain treatments, many of which don’t work.
If climate change increases incidents of pathologies that bring chronic pain, it will increasingly stress the healthcare services disabled people rely on, she said.
That office coordinated chronic pain research activities across the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services, and facilitated both public-facing and Congressional communication on chronic pain research.
Advocates worried that without this office, chronic pain research coordination across the NIH and HHS would suffer.","Dawn Gibson can literally feel storms coming in her bones.

“I’ll start feeling like this gnawing and throbbing in my bones and joints,” the 48-year-old suburban Detroiter said. “I get this feeling like my body is getting very heavy, and it’s almost like those old diving suits with the big window in front.”

Imani Barbarin, in Philadelphia, sometimes feels like her pain is better at predicting the weather than the app on her phone.

“It kind of builds; usually I feel it most in the morning the day of [the storm],” the 35-year-old said. “It’ll be like, something’s off, and it’ll be sunny outside, like I don’t get it. Then all of a sudden it’ll just be all cloudy, pouring out rain.”

Gibson and Barbarin are among the more than 50 million Americans who have some form of ongoing, regular pain—the fastest growing chronic condition in America. Gibson suffers from ankylosing spondylitis and fibromyalgia, which both lead to widespread pain throughout the body and overall fatigue, while Barbarin has cerebral palsy.

And for as long as people have reported recurring pain that doesn’t respond adequately to treatment, they’ve complained about the weather making it worse. Atmospheric changes intensifying pain “is a common complaint among people with persistent pain” said Dr. Corey Simon, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Duke University, who sees patients coping with it in his practice.

There is a library of studies trying to understand the connection between chronic pain and weather, but no single theory has prevailed in the medical establishment. Nonetheless, patients, clinicians and epidemiologists all agree that weather is a factor in some pain. Now, as climate change slowly remakes weather patterns and atmospheric trends, a new question is emerging: Is global warming increasing the torment of those suffering from chronic pain?

The Agony of a Rapidly-Increasing Chronic Condition

Everyone feels pain, from the immediately sharp, but then dull throb of a stubbed toe, to the searing sting of a cut hand sliced while peeling vegetables or the deep soreness of heavy bruises from a fall down the stairs. While this kind of discomfort can fade quickly, chronic conditions can bring prolonged, often life-long agony that disables many people. Chronic pain both vividly colors and darkens the everyday experience of those who suffer it, according to Barbarin, a disability advocate.

“A dull ache is kind of like my normal,” she said. “I feel it on my feet all the time. I feel it on my hips, in my back.”

This rise in chronic pain is happening alongside a big increase in autoimmune disorders since 2017, said Dr. Tamiko Katsumoto, clinical associate professor of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University. The outcome is now that chronic pain is “our most prevalent chronic health condition, number one cause of disability globally, [and] most expensive,” Nicholson said. Half a trillion dollars are spent annually on chronic pain treatments, many of which don’t work.

Weathering Pain That’s Hard to Study

Elderly osteoarthritis patients often complain that cold, wet conditions make their pain worse, Simon, at Duke University, said. Dr. Sara Wallace, an orthopaedic surgeon and assistant professor at the University of Chicago Medical Center, has seen similar pain triggers in her patients.

“I can say anecdotally that most patients who come to the door, if not all patients with arthritis, will tell you that when the weather changes, when it’s going to rain outside, when it’s going to snow, patients do say that their pain is worse,” she said.

Rain, or stormy weather, is often associated with lower barometric pressure. “If the barometric pressure, for example, outside goes down, then that may allow the joints to swell in the body,” potentially increasing pain, Wallace explained.

“There’s a lot more variability in day-to-day pressure during winter than summer” in the United States, said Steve Vavrus, Wisconsin State climatologist and assistant director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This could explain the “wet and cold” connection that Simon and Wallace have been observing.

For Barabarin, even weather conditions this mundane can be devastating.

“There are some days where I just become so jumbled up,” she said. “Sometimes I just can’t get my body to cooperate, and that’s not necessarily pain, but it’s also environmentally implied too.”

In a scenario in which the pain occurs in a variety of winter conditions that occur simultaneously—wet, cold, low barometric pressure—it can be hard to identify the meteorological source of pain. Such atmospheric complexities can make research at the intersection of chronic pain and weather even more inconclusive.

As osteoarthritis is a fairly common cause of chronic pain experienced by many older people globally, it’s drawn a lot of research and made people in their sixties a somewhat uniform population to study. But even with consistency among the patients studied, the results vary widely.

U.S.-based researchers in 2007 found that older American patients felt more arthritis pain with high barometric pressure. In 2015, researchers in Northern Europe found that osteoarthritis patients throughout Europe experience worse pain in colder, more humid conditions and barometric pressure had little impact. A study published in 2014 that immersed older adults in cold water found that their pain tolerance decreased when exposed to frigid conditions. But then two Australian studies published in 2016 found that weather had limited impact on chronic musculoskeletal pain in people over 40.

Timothy McAlindon, a rheumatologist and professor at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School and a co-author on the study focused on Americans, thinks that investigating only the physiological connection between weather and pain is why these studies are not conclusive. He pointed out that people “have their own prior hypotheses” that inform their perceptions of pain.

Psychology, particularly mood and memory, really influences perception of pain related to weather, McAlindon, Wallace and Simon agree.

“If your mood has been very positive, very high, then you may, generally speaking, experience less pain in your body,” Wallace explained. “Whereas, if your mood is kind of low and maybe you have some seasonal associated depression, maybe you notice that joint pain more.”

Volatile, climate-driven weather shifts can drive mood swings, as well as “climate grief” and “eco-anxiety.”

Additionally, if the weather has you trapped inside, you lose your ability to exercise, which can help alleviate pain from osteoarthritis, Wallace and Simon both explained.

Exercise is also key to maintaining good mental health. But for many folks with varying degrees of pain and disability, walking outside might be the only form of exercise available to them, Gibson added, and that might become more difficult if climate change brings more heat or precipitation to their community.

The myriad weather impacts on mental health and mood can lead people to fixate on their pain more when the weather is poor, Simon said. Humans have a tendency “to invest in patterns” which can lead to “confirmation bias,” he noted.

“Such biases can lead us to remember pain on poor weather days [rather] than pain on good weather days.”

A prolonged poor mood can turn into chronic stress, which can make pain worse by triggering the body to release cortisol, which increases inflammation, Katsumoto said.

Collaboration Challenges Hinder Research

Though deeply unsettled, research on chronic pain and weather exists. But studies of chronic pain explicitly related to climate change do not, and atmospheric scientists and epidemiologists seldom collaborate on research into the topic.

“The data are in different formats,” Vavrus said. “There’s just a different language spoken between the different fields.”

Few of the many weather and pain studies include atmospheric scientists. The research often treats weather as though it’s fixed throughout the day, with few looking at how temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and precipitation fluctuations over a 24-hour time period might affect pain.

It’s hard to make conclusions “if you only have one data point,” Vavrus said. If these studies did incorporate meteorology as it changes, research might be more robust, but the complex challenges of comprehensively determining what climate change is doing to weather will make figuring out its impacts on pain even more difficult.

Global warming is bringing more heatwaves and an atmosphere that sucks up more moisture to feed storms. Those thermodynamic effects of climate change often have more clear ties to pain. For example, gout sufferers living in Arizona—which will continue to get hotter and dryer as global temperatures increase—will likely experience worse pain due to more frequent and severe instances of dehydration driven by the increasing temperatures and aridity. That’s on top of the exacerbation of the pain by the heat itself.

Anna Samson, a 26-year old writer and disability advocate from Toronto, has axial spondyloarthritis (a form of arthritis) and fibromyalgia. When temperatures start getting into the upper 70s, it feels like “the slightest movement takes all the effort in the world,” she said via email. And high humidity can send her literally reeling.

“[Humidity], in particular, instantly makes me dizzy,” she added. “It feels like running into an invisible wall, and I have to sit or lie down until my head stops spinning.”

“My joints will feel slow and sticky, like they have hot, burning glue inside them,” she said. “It makes everything difficult to do.”

One irony of the warming climate is the possibility that it could bring more polar vortexes of unusually frigid temperatures to otherwise temperate parts of North America. The strength of the polar jet stream that circulates around the Arctic is driven by the North Pole being much colder than the equator. But with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, that differential between warm and cold temperatures has decreased. And some scientists have proposed that the polar jet stream is slowing down and starting to wobble like a top that’s about to stop spinning, with its teetering dropping cold, polar air to more temperate, lower-latitude regions like Michigan.

“There’s good theoretical reasons why we would expect that climate change should generally slow down the strength of the westerly polar jet stream,” Vavrus said.

“My joints will feel slow and sticky, like they have hot, burning glue inside them. It makes everything difficult to do.”

— Dawn Gibson

For folks susceptible to cold this is ominous news, and a way climate change impacts on atmospheric dynamics could worsen chronic pain.

Three years ago, Gibson was diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome, which causes decreased blood flow to the extremities. In cold weather, such as when frigid Arctic temperatures descend to lower latitudes, this can cause pain and even lead to frostbite—health challenges that Gibson is facing more often than she expected in a warming climate.

“When we have a polar vortex, I try not to go outside, because there is a very real chance of something bad happening,” she said.

Torment During and After Tempests

The increasing incidence and severity of climate-driven extreme weather events complicates the lives of those experiencing chronic pain during extreme weather events and also in their aftermath.

Those pains and the stress of the extreme weather that brought them on pile up into an emotional toll that can also manifest itself physically.

“Our streets were flooded. People lost so many items. It’s emotionally oppressive,” Gibson recalled. “When these big storms come now, or there’s a potential for these big storms, I do feel this terrible dread.”

The looming threats of displacement, loss of valuables or harms to loved ones can spike levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with stress reactions, which increases many forms of chronic pain, Katsumoto said.

Climate change is also altering when, where and how humans are sickened by infectious disease. Vector-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, dengue fever, chikunguna and malaria have all become more prevalent and widespread as global temperatures warm, a trend that researchers expect to continue. And autoimmune diseases—many of which cause repetitive pain—are “oftentimes triggered by infections,” Katsumoto said.

“Not to mention that autoimmune disease patients are immunosuppressed,” she added, “so they’re going to be more susceptible to infections.”

Some medications prescribed to treat pain have side effects that can be more dangerous as the climate warms. Gibson takes duloxetine, an antidepressant that also treats chronic pain, but like other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression, the drug substantially reduces the heat tolerance of the people who take it. The increasing frequency, severity and duration of heatwaves make this and similar pain management medications more dangerous to prescribe.

“If you’re on [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors], you can’t live where it’s too hot any longer.” Barbarin warned. “You will die.”

Federal Urgency Wanes as Diagnoses Increase

Autoimmune diagnoses have been rising, in general, even without the potential increases climate change could bring.

“Our wait times have gone up tremendously,” Katsumoto said about healthcare providers who treat rheumatic diseases like arthritis, gout and Lupus. If climate change increases incidents of pathologies that bring chronic pain, it will increasingly stress the healthcare services disabled people rely on, she said.

All of this comes as the Trump administration is narrowing the research scope of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, key agencies for monitoring chronic illness, Barbarin and Katsumoto said.

Before the start of the second Trump Administration, funding for pain research at the NIH was about two percent of the agency’s annual research budget. Pain advocates had lobbied Congress for nearly a decade to double that amount, said Christin Veasley, co-founder and director of The Chronic Pain Research Alliance, at a conference in August.

But this past April, the Trump Administration proposed a 40 percent funding cut to the NIH, including terminating the Office of Pain Policy and Planning. That office coordinated chronic pain research activities across the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services, and facilitated both public-facing and Congressional communication on chronic pain research. Advocates worried that without this office, chronic pain research coordination across the NIH and HHS would suffer.

There was, however, hope this summer that those cuts wouldn’t be permanent.

“Some perceived the president’s budget as merely a proposal and others looked at it more of like a policy framework by which they would start negotiating,” Veasley said in August.

While some of the 2025 NIH cuts have been reversed, almost $38 million in pain-related research funding was terminated and around $74 million remains frozen, according to Grant Witness, which is tracking Trump administration cuts to scientific research agencies. These terminated and frozen grants comprise roughly 27 percent of pain-related funding from the NIH. When Inside Climate News asked specifically about the future of the Office of Pain Policy and Planning, the NIH Press Team wrote that “as the [office] was not responsible for conducting or funding research activities, its closure does not impact the scope or continuity of federally supported scientific research.”

But Linda Porter, former director of the Office of Pain Policy and Planning, worries that the office’s closure could upend “decades of progress in enhancing federally funded pain research.”

“The value of NIH research arises not simply from ‘conducting or funding research activities,’ but also from careful evaluation of the current research endeavor, how it benefits the lives of people who it is meant to serve, and how best to move research into the future,” she wrote in response to the Press Team’s statement. “The Office also developed and oversaw training programs for the next generation of researchers, provided networking channels for communication across research disciplines and with people who live with pain.”

Veasley told Inside Climate News via email that the Chronic Pain Research Alliance and other pain advocates “have not gotten any indication that the Office will reopen.”

Cuts to pain research also coincide with steep reductions in federal climate research funding.

This year, the number of geoscience grants awarded by the National Science Foundation, which often fund meteorology and climate science, have dropped by 35 percent relative to the yearly average over the last decade. And with the Trump administration targeting federal climate science with budget cuts, staff reductions and the removal of data from federal websites, getting funding from Washington for research at the intersection of global warming and pain is virtually impossible.

As questions about their continued suffering go unanswered by government-supported research, Barbarin said many disabled people are leaning on one another, and using each other’s anecdotes to better understand their conditions. Online forums, like Reddit, provide critical community spaces. The r/ChronicPain subreddit has been around since 2009, and has 87,000 weekly visitors with 4,600 weekly global contributors who often discuss their struggles with their conditions. The number of posts about weather-triggered pain have ticked steadily upwards over the past three years.

“It’s weirdly comforting to realize I’m not alone in this, but also frustrating how much control the weather seems to have over my body,” one contributor wrote. “It’s like a predicting super power,” another user responded about their chronic pain.

For now, sharing their experiences with one another might be the most reliable way forward.

“When you have something that is a lot unknown, that means you have to live and make your life work while you’re waiting for the science to catch up,” Gibson said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2247506229-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 06:15:28.237161

Chinese automaker BYD overtook the company in 2025, as expiring US tax credits, overseas competition, and political backlash weighed on demand.

BYD Overtakes Tesla in 2025 Sales

Tesla said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, a nine percent drop from the previous year. That figure placed the company behind BYD, which sold 2.26 million battery electric vehicles during the same period.

The shift marked the first time BYD has taken the global sales lead in fully electric vehicles. Tesla had held the top position for several years, supported by strong demand in the United States and Europe.

The gap between the two companies was wide. BYD sold more than 620,000 vehicles compared to Tesla during the year, reflecting its rapid expansion in both domestic and overseas markets.

Second Year of Falling Deliveries

Tesla’s 2025 results followed a weak performance in 2024, when deliveries also declined. The two-year slide marked the sharpest downturn in the company’s history since it became a mass-market manufacturer.

For the final quarter of 2025, Tesla delivered 418,227 vehicles. That total was down more than 15 per cent from the same period a year earlier and fell short of analyst expectations.

Market analysts had forecast around 440,000 deliveries for the quarter. The lower-than-expected result added to concerns about slowing consumer demand in key markets.

Tax Credits and Political Backlash

The fall in sales was partly linked to the end of a US$7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers. The incentive expired at the end of September under the Trump administration, raising the effective purchase price for many customers.

Sales had surged in the third quarter as buyers rushed to secure the credit before it ended. That rush left a weaker fourth quarter, as demand cooled after the subsidy disappeared.

Tesla also faced consumer resistance tied to chief executive Elon Musk’s political positions. Public criticism of his right-wing views has led some buyers to avoid the brand, especially in Europe.

Growing Pressure From Chinese Rivals

BYD’s rise has been driven by aggressive product launches and expanding global reach. The company introduced a wide range of new models over the past five years, targeting multiple price segments.

Its overseas sales exceeded one million vehicles in 2025, with strong growth in Europe and parts of Asia. BYD has also announced new factories in Europe to reduce costs and avoid regional trade barriers.

Tesla, by contrast, has relied on existing platforms. The Model 3 and Model Y remain the company’s main products, despite being based on older designs compared with newer competitors.

Price Cuts Fail to Halt Slide

In October, Tesla introduced lower-priced versions of the Model Y and Model 3 in an effort to revive demand. The Model Y was priced just under US$40,000, while the Model 3 was listed below US$37,000.

The models were designed to compete more directly with cheaper Chinese vehicles in Europe and Asia. Even so, the move failed to prevent an overall decline in annual deliveries.

The pricing strategy has also affected profit margins, adding pressure as Tesla faces more intense competition in the global EV market.

Stock Rises Despite Weak Sales

Despite falling vehicle sales, Tesla shares ended 2025 with an overall gain of about 11 per cent. Investors continued to back the company based on expectations tied to future technology projects.

Tesla stock was down nearly three per cent in trading after the latest delivery figures were released. However, shares had reached record highs late last year.

Market analysts said investors are now more focused on Tesla’s ambitions in robotaxi services and artificial intelligence rather than its current vehicle sales.

Robotaxi and Regulatory Challenges

Tesla has begun rolling out a robotaxi service in Austin, first with safety monitors inside vehicles and later without them. The company plans to expand the service to more cities this year.

Musk has said software updates could allow hundreds of thousands of Teslas to operate without human intervention by the end of the year. The company is also planning to begin production of its driverless Cybercab in 2026.

Regulators have raised concerns about safety. Tesla is facing several federal investigations and could temporarily lose its licence to sell cars in California over claims it misled customers about vehicle safety.

Leadership and Investor Support

In November, Tesla shareholders approved a new pay package for Musk aimed at keeping him focused on the company. The package could make him the world’s first trillionaire if he sells shares in SpaceX.

Investors appear willing to accept weak car sales in exchange for long-term bets on automation and robotics. That shift has changed how markets value Tesla compared with traditional carmakers.

For now, BYD’s rapid growth has placed it firmly at the top of the global electric vehicle market, while Tesla faces mounting pressure to stabilise its core business.

FAQs

Why did Tesla lose its title as the world’s top electric vehicle maker?

Tesla was overtaken by BYD after its global electric vehicle deliveries fell in 2025 while BYD’s sales continued to rise. The change made BYD the world’s biggest EV seller for the year.

How many electric vehicles did BYD sell compared with Tesla in 2025?

BYD sold about 2.26 million electric vehicles in 2025. Tesla delivered about 1.64 million vehicles during the same period, leaving BYD well ahead in global sales.

What caused Tesla’s sales to decline?

Tesla’s sales were affected by stronger competition from Chinese and other global manufacturers, as well as the end of key electric vehicle tax credits in the United States, which made EVs more expensive for buyers.

Does BYD’s lead reflect worldwide sales?

Yes. BYD’s position as the top electric vehicle maker is based on its global sales, including strong growth in China, Europe, and other international markets.

Is this the first time Tesla has lost the global EV sales lead?

Yes. Tesla had held the top position for several years before being overtaken by BYD in 2025 on a full-year sales basis.

Does Tesla still lead in any markets?

Tesla remains a leading electric vehicle brand in several countries, including the United States. However, BYD surpassed Tesla in total worldwide electric vehicle sales during 2025.

Bull Case EV and hybrid win momentum: Net new business awards exceeding $229 million YTD on EV and hybrid platforms support the case for above-market growth.
Investment Conclusion Cooper-Standard has delivered exceptional returns over the past year, powered by margin improvement, cost-savings execution, and wins on EV programs.","ted to grow at a CAGR of about 3.7% from 2025 to 2035, helped along by electrification and tighter emissions standards. In the US, OEM production is expected to reach roughly $754.5 billion by 2033, growing at a 1.72% CAGR from 2025 to 2033.

Cooper-Standard goes up against big-name suppliers like Denso, Continental, Magna, and Faurecia. Its angle is lean manufacturing plus materials-science know-how, which it’s using to win OEM awards – particularly on hybrid and battery-electric vehicle programs.

Recent Performance

CPS has been on a tear: over the past year, it delivered a 186.6% total return, miles ahead of the S&P 500’s 16.0% gain.

The market move wasn’t just vibes – the business improved sharply too. Operating profitability stepped up as cost-savings programs and Kaizen initiatives helped margins:

Adjusted EBITDA rose by $29.4 million year-over-year to $58.7 million in Q1 2025 (that’s 8.8% of sales).

Operating income surged 539%.

In July 2025, management raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $220 million–$250 million, pointing to improving volumes and efficiency gains. And Cooper-Standard booked $132 million of net new business awards in H1 2025, a sign it’s getting more exposure to EV and hybrid platforms.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Cooper-Standard’s trailing-12-month revenue was $2.73 billion in 2024, down 3.0% from 2023, as light-vehicle production cooled in some regions.

The more recent picture looked better: in Q3 2025, sales increased 1.5% year-over-year to $695.5 million, helped by favorable volume/mix and FX tailwinds. It also reported $229 million of new business awards year-to-date, mainly tied to electrified platforms.

With industry growth expected to be modest (around 3.7% CAGR globally), Cooper-Standard’s push into hybrid and EV programs points to mid-single-digit revenue growth potential in 2026.

Quality & Moat

The headline number on quality is capital efficiency. Cooper-Standard’s ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) sits at 46.6%, far above both its five-year average of 6.2% and the market average of 11.4%.

Margins have also improved, even if they’re not “best in class” yet:

Operating margin is now positive at 4.28%.

That’s a big step up from its five-year average of –1.98%.

But it’s still below the global auto components peer average of 18.3%.

Cash generation is the other standout. Cooper-Standard’s free cash flow (FCF) yield is 60.6%, way above the market average of 2.0%, which gives it plenty of fuel for debt reduction and reinvestment.

On execution, management has delivered over $29 million in cost savings through lean initiatives and Kaizen programs, including a Champions of Excellence Award in the Czech Republic. It’s also continuing to win design-in awards with top OEMs.

Valuation

On traditional valuation metrics, CPS looks cheaper than the wider market:

Forward P/E: 19.9x, versus the market’s 26.3x, and also below peers in auto components.

EV/Sales: 0.61x, versus the market average of 4.46x and its five-year average of 0.48x.

That discount reflects real issues: cyclical exposure, elevated leverage, and a history of earnings volatility. But it may also underplay the company’s high ROIC and exceptional FCF yield.

Market Sentiment

Wall Street’s broadly constructive on CPS. Analysts mostly rate it a “Buy”, with a consensus price target near $39 – about 20% upside from current levels.

Institutional ownership is still high among automotive-focused funds, and short interest is modest. The company has also made some attention-grabbing leadership hires, including a new CIO and AI officer, pointing to a bigger push into digital manufacturing.

Sentiment has been helped by margin expansion and EV design wins, though supply-chain headwinds and inflation worries still pop up and cool things down at times.

Key Risks

Cyclical end-market exposure: Light-vehicle production cycles are sensitive to macroeconomic downturns, trade tensions, and tariffs. That can materially reduce OEM order volumes and margins.

Elevated leverage: Net debt/EBITDA of 4.75x is well above the auto-components average of 1.14x, raising interest costs and refinancing risk if rates stay high or move higher.

Profit volatility: Operating margins are still below peer averages, and profitability can swing with raw-material costs, FX movements, and customer production cuts.

High stock volatility: With a beta of 2.13 and realized volatility of 33.7% versus the market’s 22.7%, the share price can swing hard when markets get stressed.

Supply-chain and inflation risk: Inflation and logistics bottlenecks could squeeze margins if Cooper-Standard can’t fully offset them through cost-savings initiatives.

Bull Case

EV and hybrid win momentum: Net new business awards exceeding $229 million YTD on EV and hybrid platforms support the case for above-market growth.

Cost-savings and lean execution: Kaizen and digital manufacturing programs have delivered over $29 million in annual savings, supporting ongoing margin expansion.

Undemanding valuation: At a forward P/E of 19.9x and EV/Sales of 0.61x, CPS looks inexpensive versus peers when you factor in its high ROIC and free cash flow yield.

Strong free cash flow: An FCF yield of 60.6% gives the company room to pay down debt and make targeted capital investments, improving financial flexibility.

Guidance upgrades: Management raised full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $220–$250 million, which signals confidence in volumes and operating leverage.

Bear Case

Auto production downturn: If light-vehicle manufacturing slows more broadly, CPS could face order cancellations or tougher pricing.

Debt and interest burden: High leverage magnifies the downside if free cash flow unexpectedly drops, or if refinancing gets more expensive.

Competitive intensity: Bigger Tier-1 suppliers with deeper pockets could undercut pricing or win the best design slots, hurting Cooper-Standard’s share.

Margin still below peers: Operating margins of 4.3% remain far below the global auto-component average of around 18%, leaving less cushion if conditions worsen.

FX and raw-material volatility: A broad geographic footprint means more exposure to currency swings and commodity cost spikes, both of which can pressure profitability.

On Our Radar

Q4 2025 earnings release: Set for February 12, 2026. Investors will be watching the Q4 2025 results and full-year guidance update for margin and volume commentary.

2026 guidance timing: Updated FY 2026 sales and EBITDA targets are expected on the Q4 earnings call, which should clarify management’s assumptions on volume recovery.

Detroit Auto Show highlights: January 2026 auto shows may surface new OEM platform designs and awards for sealing and fluid systems, shaping future contract opportunities.

Supply-chain outlook reports: Updates from OEM customers on production planning in H1 2026 could hint at order timing and volume shifts.

Potential M&A in supply chain: Industry consolidation could open the door to bolt-on acquisitions or partnership announcements in late 2026.

Investment Conclusion

Cooper-Standard has delivered exceptional returns over the past year, powered by margin improvement, cost-savings execution, and wins on EV programs. But it’s still an auto supplier, so the business comes with the usual cyclical exposure to vehicle production. It also carries elevated leverage.

For long-term investors who want exposure to the electrification of mobility, today’s setup could still look attractive: CPS trades at a discount on valuation, while showing high ROIC and strong free cash flow generation.

EVXL’s Take I’ve spent the last year documenting Tesla’s sales crisis across every major market.","I’ve been tracking this collision for months, and now it’s official: the company that defined the EV revolution just lost its crown while Wall Street threw a party. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.64 million vehicles, handing BYD the title of world’s largest electric vehicle maker by a margin of more than 620,000 units. Yet Tesla stock touched $489.88 last month, an all-time high.

That disconnect tells you everything you need to know about where Tesla is headed, and what it means for anyone considering a Tesla purchase or investment.

What: BYD sold 2.26 million BEVs in 2025, surpassing Tesla’s 1.64 million deliveries for the first time on an annual basis

Who: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose focus has shifted to robotaxis and humanoid robots, versus BYD, the Chinese automaker Musk laughed at in a 2011 interview

When: Tesla reported Q4 2025 deliveries on January 2, 2026, confirming 418,227 deliveries (down 15.6% YoY)

Why it matters: Tesla’s stock price is decoupling from its automotive business, investors are betting on robotaxi and Optimus robot revenue that doesn’t exist yet

The numbers come from Reuters reporting and company disclosures released this week.

The Numbers Nobody Wants to Talk About

Global EV sales grew 28% in 2025. BYD’s battery-electric sales grew 27.9%. Tesla’s deliveries dropped 8.6%. That’s not a company facing headwinds. That’s a company going backward while the market surges forward.

The fourth quarter was particularly brutal. Tesla delivered 418,227 vehicles, down 15.6% from 495,570 a year earlier and missing even the lowered analyst estimate of 434,487. For perspective, Tesla published those pessimistic analyst estimates on its own investor relations website, a first for the company, and still came in below them.

Tesla’s full-year 2025 deliveries of 1.64 million compare to 1.79 million in 2024, which was already a 1% decline from 2023. Two consecutive years of falling sales, the biggest annual drop in company history, and the stock is near record highs.

Why Wall Street Doesn’t Care About Car Sales Anymore

Here’s the quote that captures everything: “Investors are so focused on the future with Tesla that they are ignoring delivery numbers. It’s about Optimus, Robotaxi and physical AI,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, which owns Tesla shares.

Tesla shares fell about 2% on the delivery news, then recovered. The stock finished 2025 with an 11% gain despite posting its worst sales performance ever. That’s not normal market behavior for an automaker. It’s how investors treat a technology company with automotive revenue they’re willing to ignore.

This is the logical endpoint of what we documented when shareholders approved Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package while European sales cratered. Investors aren’t buying Tesla the car company. They’re buying Tesla the robotics company, the AI company, the energy storage company. The automotive business is just overhead to them.

The Tax Credit Hangover We Predicted

We’ve been warning about this since July. The September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit was always going to create a Q3 pull-forward followed by a Q4 collapse. Tesla’s record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 vehicles were artificial, buyers rushing to lock in $7,500 before it vanished.

Now the hangover is here. The Reuters report notes Tesla’s Q4 figures “come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $7,500 in federal tax credits after President Donald Trump’s administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.”

U.S. EVs accounted for just 6.2% of retail vehicle sales in Q4, down 3.6 percentage points from a year earlier. Average transaction prices rose nearly $6,000 to $53,300, according to J.D. Power. Without subsidies, EVs got more expensive and sold worse. This is exactly what we predicted when we covered Trump’s replacement tax break that offers maybe $660 in actual savings to middle-income buyers.

BYD: The Company Musk Laughed At

In October 2011, Bloomberg TV asked Elon Musk about BYD as a competitor. He laughed and said, “I don’t think they have a great product.”

Fourteen years later, BYD outsold Tesla by more than 620,000 battery-electric vehicles in a single year. BYD’s BEV sales hit 2.26 million units, up 27.9% year-over-year. Their overseas sales surpassed 1 million units for the first time, up 150% from the previous year. They’re building factories in Hungary, Turkey, and potentially Spain to neutralize EU tariffs.

As we documented in October, BYD launches cars twice as fast as Tesla. They introduced at least 17 SUV models from 2020 through 2025, roughly double the number of redesigned Ford SUVs in that period. Tesla, meanwhile, killed its $25,000 Model 2 project and is still selling the same Model 3 and Model Y platforms designed between 2017 and 2020.

The contrast couldn’t be starker. BYD is flooding every segment with fresh products. Tesla is relying on cost-cut versions of aging models while its CEO talks about robots.

What This Means for Tesla Buyers and Owners

If you’re considering a Tesla, understand what you’re buying into. The company’s leadership and investors are explicitly focused on robotaxis, humanoid robots, and AI, not on improving the Model Y you’re about to purchase. The stripped-down versions Tesla introduced in October, priced under $40,000 for Model Y and under $37,000 for Model 3, are cost-cut variants of existing platforms, not new vehicles.

For current Tesla owners, this matters for resale values. Tesla’s declining market share, particularly the 48.5% European sales collapse we documented in November, puts downward pressure on used Tesla prices. When the market leader is going backward while competitors surge forward, your three-year-old Model 3 faces stiffer competition from both new Teslas and new rivals.

Europe is particularly brutal. Tesla’s new vehicle registrations for the first 11 months of 2025 totaled just 203,382 units, a 28% decrease from 282,335 units in the same period of 2024. BYD’s European registrations in that same period hit 159,869 units, up 276%.

EVXL’s Take

I’ve spent the last year documenting Tesla’s sales crisis across every major market. Europe down 48.5%. China at three-year lows. The U.S. market collapsing after the tax credit expired. The numbers tell a consistent story: Tesla is losing the automotive race while betting everything on products that don’t exist yet.

Here’s what I expect: Tesla’s Q1 2026 will be ugly. Without tax credits pulling demand forward, without fresh products to excite buyers, and with Musk’s focus visibly elsewhere, deliveries will struggle. Analysts are already projecting a 3% drop in Q4 sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share. If Q1 confirms that trajectory, even the robotaxi believers will start asking questions.

The irony is thick. Tesla created the modern EV market. They proved electric cars could be desirable, not just dutiful. And now they’re abandoning that market to chase robots and AI while BYD, the company Musk laughed at, takes the crown Tesla worked a decade to build.

For prospective buyers, the calculus has changed. You’re not buying from the market leader anymore. You’re buying from a company whose investors have explicitly told you they don’t care about cars. Whether that matters to you depends on whether you’re buying a Tesla for the product or for the brand. The product hasn’t fundamentally changed since 2020. The brand is now something else entirely.

Chevron has in recent years been the only U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela, thanks to permission from the governments of both countries to produce and export oil there.","While he was out of office, President Trump mused about what would have happened if the United States had taken control of Venezuela.

“We would have gotten all that oil,” he said in a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention in 2023. “It would have been right next door.”

On Saturday, Mr. Trump made it clear that he now intends to follow through.

In the last year, as the Trump administration built up pressure against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader, the president and his top aides said that the aggressive U.S. actions were necessary to curb drugs and migration from that country. But on Saturday, as Mr. Trump discussed the predawn attack on Venezuela that led to the capture of its leader, it was evident that the president’s longtime fixation on oil was a driving factor in his decision to greenlight the mission.

“We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he celebrated the seizure of Mr. Maduro, promising that American companies would be able to tap more of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.

The money made, he said, would go not only to the people of Venezuela, but also to American oil companies and “to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement for the damages caused us by that country.”

There was little immediate clarity as to how the White House envisions the United States profiting from Venezuela’s oil. Analysts warn that large increases to the country’s oil production could take years and tens of billions of dollars in spending. But Mr. Trump indicated that the country’s oil wealth was a key factor not only in his decision to attack, but also in pledging that the United States would “run” Venezuela for the foreseeable future.

“It won’t cost us anything because the money coming out of the ground is very substantial,” Mr. Trump said, adding that “we’re going to get reimbursed for everything that we spend.”

Venezuela has about 17 percent of the world’s known oil reserves, or more than 300 billion barrels, more than any other country. But its production is only about 1 percent of the world total.

Before Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1976, American companies like Exxon, Mobil and Gulf Oil were major players. The country reopened its oil industry to foreign drillers in the 1990s, but Hugo Chávez, Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, began another phase of nationalization in 2007. U.S. oil giants like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips claimed they were owed billions of dollars in compensation because their operations were seized.

That history feeds the Trump administration’s contention that Venezuela stole oil from the United States — an argument that the White House increasingly made in the weeks leading up to Saturday’s attack. Stephen Miller, the senior Trump adviser central to the president’s immigration crackdown, posted on social media last month that “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela.”

“If you remember, they took all of our energy rights; they took all of our oil from not that long ago,” Mr. Trump said last month. “And we want it back.”

Laying claim to other countries’ oil has long been a fixture in Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.

“I’ve been saying it for years. Take the oil,” he told The New York Times in 2016, when asked how his strategy to fight the Islamic State in the Middle East would differ from President Barack Obama’s approach.

As the Trump administration increased its pressure on Mr. Maduro during the last year, oil was not initially central to its public rationale. Instead, the White House focused on claims that Mr. Maduro had directed drug trafficking and gang members who migrated to the United States — some of which have been disputed by Mr. Trump’s own intelligence agencies. When Mr. Trump said in March that he would impose tariffs on countries that buy Venezuelan oil, he said he was doing it because, he claimed, Venezuela had “purposefully and deceitfully” sent “murderers and people of a very violent nature” to the United States.

But behind the scenes, as The Times reported last month, the future of Venezuela’s oil was central to Mr. Trump’s deliberations as early as last spring. The White House saw the pressure campaign against Venezuela as a way to combine three separate policy goals: crippling Mr. Maduro, using military force against drug cartels and securing access to Venezuela’s oil reserves for U.S. companies.

Chevron has in recent years been the only U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela, thanks to permission from the governments of both countries to produce and export oil there. Chevron’s activities played into the White House deliberations, as the company lobbied the White House for an extension of the Biden-era license that allowed it to expand its operations in Venezuela, as The Times previously reported.

However, on Saturday, Chevron was circumspect, even after Mr. Trump said that U.S. companies would soon spend “billions of dollars” on Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.

The company initially sent reporters a statement saying it was “prepared to work constructively with the U.S. government during this period, leveraging our experience and presence to strengthen U.S. energy security.” It later said the statement was incorrect and issued a new one that removed mention of the U.S. government.

“Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,” the company said. “We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.”

This is why permitting reform — the process of streamlining and speeding up government approval for clean energy projects and infrastructure — is essential to address our emerging electricity demand crisis in Virginia.

The energy sector is a permit-rich environment. From siting a new electricity generation facility, to long-distance transmission lines and local distribution networks, permits play a key role at every stage. It can take a decade or more for energy projects to move from start of construction to full operation and the permit process is a large part of that. The need to alleviate these bottlenecks is why I and others with Citizens’ Climate Lobby are asking Congress to pass bipartisan permitting reform.

Such reform measures must balance environmental protection with economic growth by setting a reasonable statute of limitations for judicial review under the National Environmental Policy Act. Reform should streamline interstate transmission permits while giving states the initial authority with the federal government intervening if the states need assistance in the permitting process. Accelerating the process for rejected as well as accepted projects means that time and resources are not wasted on projects that are ultimately rejected.

All this can be facilitated by early community input and full transparency. This is especially true for communities that do not directly benefit from infrastructure such as transmission lines but that would be affected by their construction and operation. Permits for simple updates or low-impact projects should be considered under categorical exclusions that allow for a simpler, streamlined process.

Permitting reform is deeply connected to our effort to solve the climate change threat. Virginians who live in the western mountains and the Tidewater region have experienced the effects of a changing climate through flash floods in the west and sea level rise in the east. Extreme weather events result in higher food prices and insurance rates for automobiles and homes. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, from 1970 to 2025 Virginia’s cooling degree days — when extra energy is needed for air conditioning — increased by 47%, slightly less than 1% per year. While climate change helps drive summer cooling demand, most of the projects slowed by permitting obstacles involve cheaper clean energy. Getting these sources of energy on the grid faster will reduce our need for heat-trapping fossil fuels and contribute to price stability.

Electricity prices in Virginia have risen substantially. Historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates that between 2000 and 2024 Virginia residential electricity prices almost doubled (92%) or more than 2.5% per year. In 2023, according to EIA, Virginia was the top importer of electricity from other states. Also, between 2019 and 2023, Virginia’s commercial sector had the largest growth in electricity demand of any state, largely due to data centers. All this makes Virginia particularly vulnerable to the permitting process in place and is a real threat to sustained economic growth.

There is positive bipartisan support for permitting reform. The Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus has proposed a framework for moving forward and the National Governors Association has written a letter supporting action. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and the incoming General Assembly will work on the data center issues, but Congress has authority on permitting that they lack.

Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner have a history of bipartisanship. Although these are partisan times, it is my hope that Virginia’s members of Congress will negotiate in good faith to control rising costs and bring new clean energy sources and technologies to consumers. Our leaders have the power to keep Virginia economically competitive — and power outages at bay.

Tesla's sales fell in 2025, ceding its position as the world's biggest electric vehicle maker for the year to Chinese auto giant BYD.

The American company led by Elon Musk said on Friday it logged 418,227 deliveries in the final three months of the year, taking its full-year sales figure to around 1.64 million EVs.

This marked a drop in sales of more than 8 percent compared with 2024.

A day prior, BYD said it sold 2.26 million EVs last year.

Analysts had expected Tesla's sales in the final quarter to slow less, to 449,000, according to a FactSet consensus.

The pullback comes amid the elimination of a US$7,500 US tax credit at the end of September, with industry watchers noting it will take time for EV demand to rebalance.

But even before then, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over political support by Musk, the company's chief executive, of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians.

Tesla has also been grappling with rising competition from BYD, other Chinese companies and from European giants.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, unveiled record EV sales in the past year on Thursday.

Known as ""Biyadi"" in Chinese – or by the English slogan ""Build Your Dreams"" – BYD was founded in 1995 and originally specialised in battery manufacturing.

The automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term used to describe various vehicles from fully electric ones to plug-in hybrids. China is the world's largest market for new energy vehicles.

BYD is now looking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.

While BYD and other Chinese EV producers come up against hefty tariffs in the United States, the company's success is picking up in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in Europe.

Tesla only narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with the US company's 1.79 million outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.

Tesla shares closed 2.6 percent down in New York on Friday.

Analysts at Wedbush Securities noted that Tesla's quarterly sales figure remained better than some had speculated.

They flagged that the company faces a ""more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries"".

The company still sees challenges obtaining certain regulatory approval in Europe – relating to self-driving technology – with sales potentially rebounding once the regulatory hurdles are cleared.

Through the first 11 months of last year, BYD registered more cars than Tesla in both Germany and the UK, the region’s two biggest EV markets.

2026 Outlook Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical about Tesla’s 2026 sales prospects.","Tesla Inc. ceded the title of world’s top seller of electric cars to China’s BYD Co., squandering a lead the Elon Musk-led company built as it popularized plug-in vehicles over the past decade.

The US automaker reported a 16% decline in fourth quarter deliveries, trailing analyst estimates. For the year, Tesla sales slid almost 9%, its second consecutive annual drop.

BYD, by contrast, increased battery-electric vehicle sales both for the quarter and the full year, delivering almost 2.26 million EVs in 2025 to Tesla’s 1.64 million.

Investors have paid little mind of late to Tesla’s decline in the global EV pecking order, with Musk prioritizing artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The chief executive officer has drawn attention away from Tesla’s core business by touting progress in his longstanding effort to start a robotaxi service.

Standing up those operations will be crucial in 2026 given the outlook for EV demand in the US, Tesla’s largest market. President Donald Trump’s administration has ceased federal incentives supporting plug-in vehicle purchases and hollowed out fuel economy and emissions regulations that had generated billions of dollars in revenue for the company.

“Deliveries barely matter anymore,” Alexander Potter, an analyst with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, said in a note Friday. Instead, the performance of Tesla’s shares in 2026 “should be driven by progress in AI and robotics.”

AI Emphasis

Wall Street had been bracing for a “hangover” for Tesla after tax credits for EV purchases ended in the US, William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note. He similarly posited that the company “is valued almost entirely on the transformation to real-world AI.”

Tesla shares fell 2.8% as of 1:35 p.m. Friday in New York. The stock advanced 11% last year, paring gains after hitting an all-time high in mid-December.

BYD pulled away from Tesla last year after coming up just shy of the world leader in 2024. While the Chinese manufacturer delivered more fully electric cars in the fourth quarter of that year, Tesla maintained a slim lead on an annual basis.

In addition to selling far more EVs in China — where some of its cars are far cheaper than Tesla’s most affordable vehicle, the Model 3 — BYD has been surging in Europe.

Through the first 11 months of last year, BYD registered more cars than Tesla in both Germany and the UK, the region’s two biggest EV markets. Tesla’s sales across Europe fell 28% during that span, and the company posted steep December declines in France, Spain and Sweden.

2026 Outlook

Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical about Tesla’s 2026 sales prospects. This time two years ago, analysts were predicting Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles. The average estimate has plunged to around 1.8 million.

Tesla’s energy storage battery business, on the other hand, has never been stronger.

The company deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of energy storage products last quarter, up from the 11 gigawatt hours a year earlier. Total deployments for the year jumped almost 50% to 46.7 gigawatt hours.

“The sustained growth of energy storage reflects structural tailwinds from AI-driven electricity demand, which is driving incremental storage requirements to support data center buildouts and power grid stabilization,” Tom Narayan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock, said in a note.

Tesla ended last year by building anticipation for Cybercab, a two-seat compact car with butterfly doors. While prototypes have lacked a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm told Bloomberg News in October that the company will sell the car with those components if required by regulators.

While Tesla began driverless testing with Model Ys in Austin late last month, consumers thus far are only able to summon rides from small numbers of cars in the Texas capital and the San Francisco Bay area with safety supervisors in the front seats.

For his part, Musk is optimistic about the year ahead.

“Great work by @Tesla team in 2025,” he wrote this week on X. “2026 will be epic!”

I argued that this should not have been figured into the price of the vehicle. She said she tried to correct this higher up the chain to no avail.

Chevron, the only US oil company still operating in Venezuela, committed only to following “relevant laws and regulations” after the US president suggested American energy multinationals would be central to his plans for the country.

Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – reputedly the world’s largest – will be modernized and exploited, Trump claimed in interviews and a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate. US oil firms will invest heavily to reconstruct “rotted” infrastructure, ramp up production and sell “large amounts … to other countries”, he told reporters, adding: “We’re in the oil business.”

“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies – the biggest anywhere in the world – go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country,” the president said. The firms would be “reimbursed”, he added, without providing more detail.

ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil company, and ConocoPhillips, another major player, did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for Chevron said: “Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.”

Venezuela​ moved to nationalize its oil industry some 50 years ago, and​ later ​seized control of operations still run under private arrangements​ in 2007. While Chevron agreed to remain, others including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips​ refused to accept new terms.

ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips engaged in a years-long legal battle with Venezuela after exiting, and were ultimately awarded billions of dollars by the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. But Venezuela, with an economy battered by sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, has yet to pay all the money.

For now, a US embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect, according to Trump, whose administration has repeatedly accused the country of stealing American wealth and property by seizing control of the reserves. As the US moves to take them back, its next steps will be closely scrutinized amid questions over the legality of Trump’s vision.

Trump’s suggestion that US oil majors would play a key role in Venezuela prompted analysts to conclude their executives had likely been consulted ahead of time.

“My hunch is that, if President Trump said this publicly, probably there was already an agreement with the US companies,” Jorge León, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, an industry consultancy, said. Tina Fordham, a geopolitical strategist and consultant, said: “One assumes that they have been part of the conversation.”

The White House did not comment on whether it consulted US oil giants before the strike.

Administration officials have in recent weeks told US oil executives that, if they want compensation for rigs, pipelines and other seized property in Venezuela, they must return and invest heavily, according to Politico, which cited two unnamed sources familiar with the conversations.

Venezuela holds some 17% of global oil reserves, according to the Energy Institute. But its output, as high as 3.5m barrels per day in the 1970s, fell dramatically due to decades of mismanagement, corruption and underinvestment. Production from Venezuela was around 1.m barrels per day, around 1% of the world’s output, last year.

Taking production in the country back to anywhere near its previous levels is widely expected to require huge investment. Returning to 2m barrels per day by the early 2030s would require an estimated $110bn, according to Rystad.

“I don’t think companies will rush back into the country,” said León, who suggested it would be “very, very tricky” for Venezuela to attract the private investment required to dramatically increase oil production.

He added: “Companies, before rushing back into the country, will want to see the country is stable enough. The fact this industry was nationalized by [Hugo] Chávez a few years ago, that remains in the back of their minds. They will really want to see things improving.”

The global oil market is “entering into a period of oversupply”, said León. “Prices will come down and will continue to come down … That means that oil companies will be very, very selective of where they invest, in a period of lower prices. Given the choice, they will probably want to go investing in places they already know.”

But other industry observers expect oil majors to jostle for a chance to operate in Venezuela. The country now amounts to “a huge opportunity” for big firms, said Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight. “There will be immense competition between them for the best opportunities.”

On Saturday morning, Trump hailed “one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military, might and competence” in history.

But in corporate boardrooms and beyond, memories of other toppled dictators – including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya – where the aftermath proved complicated, loom large.

“The history of post-authoritarian transitions, whether they are organic or externally brought about, is long and non-linear,” said Fordham. “Trump appears to have complete faith that, under him, things will be different.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15118474f58139106fad851dc9471f1b12314098/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=948ee7fe7753fec755aabada8c46649d",N,,2026-01-03 18:12:45.392814

A federal lawsuit filed Dec. 16 in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

The new lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office last January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the United States to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix.

Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the United States as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Last month, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

Last spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/bllxir-6bknX0i65DjubO_6P44I=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/LDW3TZY54NEUTEAZ5TX7CKT36Q.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 17:58:38.518411

The Green Fee increases the Transient Accommodations Tax by .75% to an 11% rate statewide. This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and short-term rentals. But on New Year’s Eve, a federal judge blocked one portion of the law from taking effect: specifically, the portion that would have introduced an 11% tax on cruise ship passenger bills.

That provision had faced pushback from the cruise industry earlier this year.

Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) sued the state in August, arguing the fee unfairly targets cruise passengers and will add hundreds of dollars to the price of Hawaii cruises. And in November, the U.S. Department of Justice also filed a motion in the Hawaii District Court asking a federal judge to let the federal government intervene in the cruise industry’s lawsuit against the Green Fee. The DOJ has argued that Hawaii doesn’t have the power the charge cruise ships this kind of fee, saying only Congress can approve taxes and charges on vessels when they enter a port.

A district judge denied CLIA’s request for an injunction in December, court documents show. But on Dec. 31, the Ninth Appellate Court granted an injunction after an appeal.

The CLIA applauded the decision in a statement shared with Nexstar.

“This case involves important questions about how federal and state laws interact in regulating maritime commerce — principles rooted in long-standing constitutional safeguards that protect free and open ports nationwide,” reads a statement from a CLIA spokesperson. “On behalf of its member cruise lines, CLIA will continue to pursue this matter constructively through the courts while working with Hawai‘i to support local communities and sustainable tourism.”

Hawaii Governor Josh Green and other lawmakers in support of the Green Fee had argued that the taxes were needed to mitigate environmental effects caused by tourism.

The revenue generated from the new Green Fee was projected to raise an estimated $100 million a year to address what the state says is about half a billion dollars in critical funding needed to protect Hawaii’s environment. The areas of priority are protecting land and aquatic resources, climate and hazard resiliency and sustainable tourism.

“We must protect and preserve Hawaiʻi’s natural resources and safeguard the health of our residents,” Green previously said. “Visitors who benefit from our island’s resources have a shared responsibility to help preserve them. The Green Fee ensures that the resources needed to protect Hawaiʻi are available for future generations.”

Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general’s office, believes it’s only a matter of time before the entire Green Fee is enforced.

“We are aware of the Ninth Circuit’s order granting an injunction that temporarily enjoins (halts) enforcement of Act 96 with respect to cruise ships while the appeals process moves forward,” Schwartz said in a statement shared with Nexstar’s KHON. “We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the expedited appeal is heard on the merits.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2026/01/CruiseShipHawaiiGettyImages-1721432968-e1767205449834.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-03 22:12:37.268790

Callaway",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/fracking-industry-executives-are-salivating-over-the-ai-data-center-boom/,"“The natural gas industry is directly aligning with the data center industry,” Tyson Slocum, the director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, told Truthout.
Fracking giants like EOG and Antero Resources are striking deals to position themselves to supply data centers.
That July 2025 executive order, titled “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure,” clearly emphasizes the role of fossil fuels in powering data centers.
Under Trump, data centers are also giving new life to dying and dirty coal plants, and many data centers are backed up by super-polluting diesel generators that some fear could come to be used more frequently.
Many communities are resisting both data centers and their dirty emissions — from Memphis, Tennessee, to Bessemer, Alabama, to Santa Teresa, Arizona.","“The demand for power and for AI is like nothing I’ve ever seen.”

These words were uttered during an October earnings call, not by a wide-eyed tech executive, but by Jeff Miller, the CEO of Halliburton, one of the world’s biggest oilfield services corporations.

Like droves of other companies tied to the fracked gas industry, Halliburton is pivoting toward servicing the data center boom with new loads of methane-emitting, gas-fired power generation to feed the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble being stoked by Silicon Valley billionaires and allied corporate elites.

Halliburton is merely one of many fossil fuel companies that are striking deals to power the insatiable electricity needs of data centers. More specifically, the natural gas industry — frackers, gasfield services, pipeline companies, power suppliers — are positioning themselves as bold saviors ready to step in and meet AI’s bottomless energy demands.

In doing this, fracked gas companies are fully backed by the Trump administration, with its ideological dedication to fossil fuels and its cozy relationship with billionaire oil and gas donors. For its part, Big Tech is going along, largely sidelining its purported commitments to renewable energy.

As the global climate emergency intensifies, none of this bodes well. Despite being sold as a “clean” fossil fuel, fracked gas emits loads of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and local communities — often rural, low-income, and predominantly Black — bear the brunt of the combined nexus of data center behemoths and fossil fuel power generation being constructed in their backyards.

“The natural gas industry is directly aligning with the data center industry,” Tyson Slocum, the director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, told Truthout. “From a climate perspective, and from a local environmental perspective, data centers represent a significant impediment to action on climate change.”

“Icing on the Cake”

Natural gas currently provides over 40 percent of the electricity for data centers, making gas-fired power stations their largest power source, according to the International Energy Agency.

The massive demand for electricity from data centers is driving a surge in the construction of power generation infrastructure fueled by natural gas.

One McKinsey analyst recently noted that over 100 gigawatts (GW) of new gas-fired projects are being planned. “To put that number in perspective,” he said, “over the last five years, the U.S. added only about 35 GW of gas,” meaning this is “almost triple what it was.”

Utilities announced a slew of new gas-fired power projects in 2025 — a factor that helps explain private equity’s rush to acquire utilities. Utility powering of data centers is expected to skyrocket by 22 percent this year.

Industry leaders are swooning. “It’s been 40 or 50 years, or so, since we’ve seen demand grow the way it’s growing and is expected to grow,” said one executive of energy giant NRG.

“AI is obviously a big part,” he added.

The core driver of the fracked gas industry over the past decade has been the booming production of liquified natural gas (LNG) for export, which has vastly accelerated since the Obama administration. Today, the U.S. leads the world in natural gas production and exports.

While LNG exports are unrivaled as “the demand driver and the profit center for the domestic natural gas industry,” says Slocum, data centers “provide a significant additional profit cushion.”

“Data centers are far and away the largest variable that is increasing electricity demand,” he said. “They’re sort of the icing on the cake.”

“Help Nourish That Appetite”

With 3 million miles of gas pipelines tightly networked across the country, Slocum says the fracked gas industry has positioned itself as the prime supplier for powering data centers.

This is seen through a flurry of data center deals struck by corporations across the fracked gas supply chain — independent drillers, oil and gas majors, pipeline companies, and oilfield services companies.

EQT, a top U.S. natural producer based in Western Pennsylvania, the heart of the vast Marcellus Shale formation, struck a deal to supply two huge data center hubs in Appalachia — the Shippingport and Homer City projects — with a combined 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas supplies.

“Just to put this in perspective, that’s enough natural gas to power two of New York City,” gloated EQT CEO Toby Rice, who also added that Homer City and Shippingport are “just the first steps of multiple steps in multiple projects.”

EQT is hardly alone. Fracking giants like EOG and Antero Resources are striking deals to position themselves to supply data centers. Comstock Resources, owned by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, is partnering with utility giant NextEra to “keep the lights on at a plethora of data centers” in Texas, says Natural Gas Intelligence.

Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil and gas company, is getting in the game. “AI data centers require massive amounts of energy to function,” the company gushed in a February press release.

But have no fear, they promised. “Chevron is tapping into natural gas to help nourish that appetite,” the oil giant declared, announcing a new deal to build gas-fired power plants for data centers.

“Unleashing American Energy”

While the massive energy demands of artificial intelligence are pulling the fracking industry toward data centers, the Trump administration’s policies are also playing a critical role.

“National policy under Trump is prioritizing fossil fuels for data center development” and “particularly natural gas,” Slocum told Truthout.

“It’s explicit in Trump’s July executive order on artificial intelligence, where he defines the criteria that data centers need to meet to qualify for expedited approval, and it lists every energy source except wind and solar,” Slocum added.

That July 2025 executive order, titled “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure,” clearly emphasizes the role of fossil fuels in powering data centers. It defines “Covered Components” — the “materials, products, and infrastructure that are required to build Data Center Projects” — using language that foregrounds “energy infrastructure” like “natural gas pipelines or laterals” and “natural gas turbines” and “coal power equipment” with no mention of words like “wind” or “solar.”

As Slocum has written, “a data center proposed to be powered by wind and solar will not qualify for expedited treatment, whereas a fossil fuel powered facility would,” adding that fossil fuel-powered data centers could also qualify for direct federal subsidies.

This codification of national policy around fossil fuels as the core supplier of data centers aligns with Donald Trump’s campaign promise to “Drill Baby Drill” and his adamantly pro-fossil fuel January 2025 executive order on “Unleashing American Energy.”

Since taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has gone to war against renewable energy, freezing permits around solar and wind projects and denigrating windmills.

Trump and the Fossil Fuel CEOs

Trump’s ideological commitment to feeding data centers with fossil fuel-powered electricity is wedded to his cozy relationship with the fracking billionaires who helped bankroll his 2024 reelection.

Trump saw oil and gas barons as a key constituency during his 2024 reelection campaign, and industry billionaires like Harold Hamm and Kelcy Warren showered Trump with millions in donations.

As Truthout has previously noted, Trump filled out his cabinet with fossil fuel executives and boosters, including Chris Wright, the fracking-liquid-guzzling former CEO of Liberty Energy, who Trump made energy secretary.

Since then, the fossil fuel industry has benefited handsomely from Trump’s policies of environmental deregulation and tax subsidies — and a bonanza of new business tied to data centers.

Warren is the co-founder and executive chairman of pipeline giant Energy Transfer and a longtime Trump ally. Energy Transfer is awash in new business supplying data centers from Texas to Arizona and is partnering with AI giants like Oracle.

Hamm is the founder and former CEO of fracking giant Continental Resources, and is a major Trump donor who is also backing Trump’s White House ballroom. He may be Trump’s biggest fossil fuel industry ally.

“Together,” writes The New York Times, Trump and Hamm “have remade federal policy to benefit oil and gas companies, including Mr. Hamm’s Continental, and put off the transition to greener alternatives like solar power and batteries.”

The Hamm Institute for American Energy, a research and policy hub funded by Hamm, who also serves on its board, has supported natural gas for powering AI and hosted an April event on “powering AI” that featured key Trump cabinet members leading the administration’s energy policies.

Liberty Energy — again, formerly led by Trump Energy Secretary Chris Wright — is also striking deals to power data centers in Pennsylvania.

“The only thing that’ll prevent us from leading in AI is the failure to build this electric generating capacity that needs to happen,” Wright recently raved to the Council on Foreign Relations, adding that he was “using emergency powers to stop [the] closure of coal plants” and “expediting the permitting of building of new plants.”

Big Tech’s Conformity

For its part, Big Tech has quickly backtracked on its net zero commitments as it embraces gas-fired power generation for data centers.

For example, Entergy, a power generation behemoth that relies mostly on fossil fuels, is currently constructing three massive gas-fired plants to power a $10 billion Meta data center in Louisiana.

Less than a decade ago, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg waxed about addressing the climate crisis. Fast forward to today, and headlines like “Meta goes all in on gas to power a mega data center” are being published, while Zuckerberg and Meta are being lambasted by lawmakers, energy analysts, and community groups.

This fits a larger pattern, which Truthout has reported on, of Silicon Valley CEOs backtracking on purported climate aims and criticism of Trump to remain the president’s good graces and profit off his policies.

“Trump demands conformity, and Big Tech is providing that conformity by turning its back on its traditional commitments to increase and rely upon renewable energy,” said Slocum.

Of course, all this will exacerbate the climate crisis. The production, transport, and burning of natural gas releases huge amounts of methane, which is 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere.

Under Trump, data centers are also giving new life to dying and dirty coal plants, and many data centers are backed up by super-polluting diesel generators that some fear could come to be used more frequently.

As journalist Adam Mahoney has reported, in states like South Carolina and Texas, Black households disproportionately bear the brunt of the data center boom and AI’s growing fossil fuel emissions trail, especially with on-site power generation.

Many communities are resisting both data centers and their dirty emissions — from Memphis, Tennessee, to Bessemer, Alabama, to Santa Teresa, Arizona.

To be sure, Big Tech firms are also partnering on some projects with renewable energy sources to service data centers. While U.S. data centers are overwhelmingly powered by fossil fuel sources, the International Energy Agency notes that the proportion of solar, wind, and other renewables involved will increase going into the 2030s and beyond.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2245882134.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 16:57:52.693095

NEW YORK: Tesla lost its crown as the world’s best-selling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier. Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker. It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man.

The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September. Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along. Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory and much less with car sales.",https://sundayguardianlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image_6.png,N,,2026-01-03 19:57:39.697589

WATERTOWN, S.D. – In South Dakota, where the state’s proportion of clean energy production is the highest in the country, students are taking advantage of growing energy workforce needs.

Lake Area Technical College, which has two degree-providing programs in the energy sector, has seen students with renewed interest in the industry thanks to both its growth and opportunity in the state.

Brooks Jacobsen, energy department supervisor at Lake Area Tech, told News Watch that the school’s energy operations and energy technology programs have 100% job placement rates. According to Lake Area Tech’s website, the energy technology program has an average salary of $71,000 after six months of employment.

Jacobsen said that the exposure students get to various energy sectors, including hydroelectricity, coal, wind and solar energy, allow them to be more flexible when searching for the right career.

“They’ll go do an interview or a job shadow on (a specific energy sector) and they’ll just love it, and they never thought they would. We try to keep an open mind, try to pre-teach these students that there are these capabilities all over the state,” Jacobsen said.

News Watch spoke to three students about their decision to enter the energy sector and the opportunities that the state provides for their futures. Here are their stories.

Lakshan Sethuhewa: “Energy is everywhere”

Lakshan Sethuhewa, a 29-year-old student from Sri Lanka, came to Lake Area Tech after a tour that showed him the “sophisticated program.” Now in his second year, Sethuhewa said he already has a job as a refrigeration expert lined up at the soon-to-open CJ Schwan’s Foods production facility in Sioux Falls.

He said that all of his classmates have job prospects, and that choosing energy was in part due to the vast employment opportunities the field offers.

Sethuhewa is a student in the energy operations program, which trains students to manage energy facilities and operate plants. He described the program as “hands-on and minds-on,” and appreciated how his education could translate globally.

“You can practice energy everywhere in the world. Whether you want to go to Europe, South Asia, energy is everywhere,” Sethuhewa said.

Quincy Thu: “The only thing that I could envision myself doing in the future”

For Quincy Thu, energy runs in the family: his father began teaching energy technology at Lake Area Tech in 2022, which got Thu thinking about the opportunities of the sector.

Thu said that the proximity of the school to his home in Castlewood, as well as affordability, was his deciding factor. As he comes into his final year in the program, he said that he’s particularly interested in the wind energy sector, which has strong roots in the eastern side of the state.

“I’m trying to talk to people, interview people, find out where I want to go, find the best company that fits me,” Thu said.

But he plans on staying in the state for any future career ventures.

“I’m from South Dakota, I love it here,” Thu said.

Tate Sheehan: “The industry is growing at immense rates”

Tate Sheehan, a second-year student who is originally from Bird Island, Minnesota, said that his decision to enter the energy sector comes from the idea that the industry’s growth is not slowing down any time soon.

He said that a combination of in-class work and hands-on projects has allowed him to feel exceptionally prepared for his entry into the energy world.

Though he’s a few hundred miles from home, Sheehan said he plans to stay in South Dakota and find a company he can “settle down” with while continuing to climb the career ladder – a goal he credits to seeing firsthand how quickly the industry is growing.

“There’s a lot of great opportunities through the energy technology program and the energy operations program to prepare us for the real world and get us ready to go out there and make a difference working for them,” Sheehan said.

Heike Deggim, Director of IMO’s Maritime Safety Division, elaborated on the organization’s focus in the Arctic and its engagement with the Council.

The pressing issues that attract IMO’s attention include ensuring the safety, security, and sustainability of shipping in the Arctic. IMO aims to mitigate risks related to search and rescue operations, pollution response, maritime safety, and environmental protection in this fragile region. The organization’s Polar Code establishes mandatory requirements for vessels operating in polar environments, enhancing safety standards beyond existing regulations. However, there is recognition that additional measures are needed, particularly for boats not covered by the Polar Code, such as fishing vessels and pleasure yachts. IMO has invited its Member States to voluntarily implement Polar Code safety measures across these vessels.

Broader maritime concerns also occupy IMO’s focus, including the enhancement of navigational charts, establishment of search and rescue facilities, improvements in satellite and radio communications, and the creation of port reception facilities for operational waste. A significant aspect of IMO’s mission is contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, aiming for at least a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050. This initiative is aligned with the Paris Agreement and supported by various practical projects aimed at fostering technology development and operational best practices, particularly in developing countries.

In the Arctic, Member States are intensifying efforts to address black carbon emissions from ships and are advocating for extending the current ban on heavy fuel oil from the Antarctic to Arctic waters. Furthermore, addressing marine litter and microplastics is a key initiative; IMO is collaborating with the United Nations Environment Program to combat sea-based sources of marine litter.

Following its accreditation, IMO has engaged with the Arctic Council through formal channels, building upon past informal collaborations on projects such as the “Guide on Oil Spill Response in Ice and Snow Conditions.” Current collaborations involve the Arctic Shipping Best Practice Information Forum, enhancing the effectiveness of the Polar Code. Upcoming meetings will continue to strengthen the communication between IMO Member States and the Arctic Council.

Furthermore, IMO is actively developing specifications for ships’ equipment in polar waters, focusing on guidelines for navigation and life-saving appliances for vessels not covered by the Polar Code. Recent sessions have led to the creation of guidelines targeting pleasure yachts and fishing vessels operating in these regions.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-03 23:57:31.399961

Data center opposition dominates local politics Winning over local officials, however, hasn’t translated to winning over residents.","SPRING CITY, Pa. (AP) — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.

Communities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other’s battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.

In many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.

But as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.

“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania’s East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”

Opposition spreads as data centers fan out

A growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.

Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.

“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.

Data Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.

Between April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.

Some environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.

“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.

In Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.

Similar concerns across different communities

For some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.

Losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.

Lawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.

Big Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.

Microsoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”

Even with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.

Maxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.

“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”

Some in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.

Still, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.

“It’s definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.

Data center opposition dominates local politics

Winning over local officials, however, hasn’t translated to winning over residents.

Developers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.

The project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.

Had council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That’s for sure.”

In Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.

Residents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.

They say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.

“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.

Documents revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn’t named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.”

Rebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.

She found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.

“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.

Gianarikas said EV demand, previously boosted by generous tax credits, is resetting into a smaller but more fundamentals-driven market.
He added that the current shakeout is clarifying which automakers treated EVs as core businesses rather than compliance efforts, a shift he sees as positive for Tesla’s market share.

He also flagged continued growth in energy storage, supported by the launch of Megapack 3, describing 2026 as a year with multiple new product catalysts.

In the United States the expiry of federal EV subsidies has weighed on near-term demand but is forcing the market into a healthier and more durable phase. The recent weakness reflects a pause typical of major technology transitions rather than a structural reversal in EV adoption.

Gianarikas said EV demand, previously boosted by generous tax credits, is resetting into a smaller but more fundamentals-driven market.

Pricing and incentives are normalising, weaker models are being phased out, and competition is increasingly favouring manufacturers with dedicated EV platforms, software and cost discipline.

Gianarikas said Tesla stands apart in the U.S. as the only automaker with a fully scaled and integrated EV franchise, with Rivian emerging as the only credible long-term mass-market challenger.

He added that the current shakeout is clarifying which automakers treated EVs as core businesses rather than compliance efforts, a shift he sees as positive for Tesla’s market share.

Gianarikas pointed to rising EV adoption in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil. While these regions are not yet meaningful contributors to Tesla’s results, he said they represent early-stage opportunities for longer-term growth, even as competition from Chinese automakers intensifies.

Canaccord applies a 46x multiple to its 2028 non-GAAP earnings estimate of $11.98 a share to arrive at a price target of $551.

Gianarikas said the premium valuation reflects Tesla’s long-duration growth opportunities in robotics, autonomy and energy storage. Though the implied execution leaves little room for error.

""2026 is shaping up to be a bountiful year for Tesla, with the anticipated scale-up of CyberCab and Optimus (Gen 3) production, alongside a possible acceleration in Semi output and continued expansion in energy storage driven by the launch of Megapack 3. New products galore,"" said George Gianarikas",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEL5B11W_L.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 16:57:27.877234

Do not fall for the political ploy that the economy will be boosted and jobs created if environmental regulations are weakened or eliminated.
Resolve to pay attention to what would happen to your air, water and ecosystems if certain regulations are eliminated.","Once again, my New Year’s resolutions pertain directly to our personal health and well-being. I don’t mean more trips to the gym and fewer to the refrigerator. Instead, I propose keeping our elected officials apprised that protection of natural habitats and native wildlife needs to be on the front burner. Also, those we have placed in charge have a responsibility to ensure that our shared natural resources of air and water stay clean. I have heard of proposals here and there at local, state and federal levels of government that would benefit a few at a cost to the many. If carried out, from county to national levels, the effect on the natural environment would be regrettable and would in turn adversely affect us all.

As a prime example at the federal level, substantive changes that might be forthcoming in the Environmental Protection Agency are uncertain. But any rumblings that we need to weaken the oversight and rulings by this critical government program should be cause for alarm. And the idea proposed by some of abolishing the EPA entirely is beyond alarming; it is absurd and would be inherently irresponsible for any member of Congress to support. A worthwhile New Year’s resolution would be to oppose any legislation that even hints at getting rid of a government agency that limits assaults on the environment from unchecked commercial greed. The outcomes from a weakened EPA would be detrimental to the majority of U.S. citizens.

As I have noted before, specters of what would happen by gutting the authority of the EPA are disquieting. Do we really want to curb EPA regulations that prevent mining wastes from being dumped into clear-flowing mountain streams? Do we want streams that trout and other aquatic wildlife can no longer live in? I don’t think so. President Richard Nixon had it right when he formed the EPA in 1970 and signed the Clean Water Act in 1972.

Another suggestion has been to reduce EPA air quality regulations. Such regulations limit emissions that result in undesirable outcomes such as acid rain, smog and lung cancer. Think about it. In the 1960s in Gary, Indiana, and Birmingham, Alabama, you could not see buildings half a mile away because of the smoke and soot filling the air. President Nixon did the right thing when he signed the Clean Air Act in 1970. Weakening regulatory features of the EPA would definitely not be an improvement. Clean air and clean water are crucial for maintaining the quality of life we have come to expect.

I suggest everyone resolve to keep our country’s natural heritage and a healthy environment as priorities for the coming year. Keep an eye on proposed changes in any program that can affect the environment in your community, your region, your nation. Resolve to challenge your congressional representatives when you hear of a proposal that would diminish the effectiveness of maintaining standards for potable water and unpolluted air.

Make a resolution to get the facts when politicians start making promises they claim will help everybody. Do not fall for the political ploy that the economy will be boosted and jobs created if environmental regulations are weakened or eliminated. Look, instead, at who would benefit from the loosening of any given environmental regulation. Someone will be making money. But you can be sure it won’t be you and me. We will be stuck with murky skies, undrinkable water and habitats in which our native wildlife cannot survive.

I have used the EPA as an example, but bad things could be happening environmentally in your community, your county or your state. Resolve to pay attention to what would happen to your air, water and ecosystems if certain regulations are eliminated. Will a proposed change be in the best public interest or does it financially benefit only a few special interest groups? Make environmental resolutions for yourself and future generations — and have a happy new year.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/56/556ceeed-dc8c-49af-846b-ca36fbb07ca9/695498990c1d4.image.jpg?crop=1498%2C787%2C0%2C483&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-03 14:58:18.464790

Nawyn, Michigan State University

From beginning to end, 2025 was a year of devastation for scientists in the United States.

January saw the abrupt suspension of key operations across the National Institutes of Health, not only disrupting clinical trials and other in-progress studies but stalling grant reviews and other activities necessary to conduct research. Around the same time, the Trump administration issued executive orders declaring there are only two sexes and ending DEI programs. The Trump administration also removed public data and analysis tools related to health disparties, climate change and environmental justice, among other databases.

February and March saw a steep undercutting of federal support for the infrastructure crucial to conducting research as well as the withholding of federal funding from several universities.

And over the course of the following months, billions of dollars of grants supporting research projects across disciplines, institutions and states were terminated. These include funding already spent on in-progress studies that have been forced to end before completion. Federal agencies, including NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development have been downsized or dismantled altogether.

The Conversation asked researchers from a range of fields to share how the Trump administration’s science funding cuts have affected them. All describe the significant losses they and their communities have experienced. But many also voice their determination to continue doing work they believe is crucial to a healthier, safer and more fair society.

Pipeline of new scientists cut off

Carrie McDonough, Associate Professor of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University

People are exposed to thousands of synthetic chemicals every day, but the health risks those chemicals pose are poorly understood. I was a co-investigator on a US$1.5 million grant from the EPA to develop machine-learning techniques for rapid chemical safety assessment. My lab was two months into our project when it was terminated in May because it no longer aligned with agency priorities, despite the administration’s Make America Healthy Again report specifically highlighting using AI to rapidly assess childhood chemical exposures as a focus area.

Labs like mine are usually pipelines for early-career scientists to enter federal research labs, but the uncertain future of federal research agencies has disrupted this process. I’m seeing recent graduates lose federal jobs, and countless opportunities disappear. Students who would have been the next generation of scientists helping to shape environmental regulations to protect Americans have had their careers altered forever.

I’ve been splitting my time between research, teaching and advocating for academic freedom and the economic importance of science funding because I care deeply about the scientific and academic excellence of this country and its effects on the world. I owe it to my students and the next generation to make sure people know what’s at stake.

Fewer people trained to treat addiction

Cara Poland, Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University

I run a program that has trained 20,000 health care practitioners across the U.S. on how to effectively and compassionately treat addiction in their communities. Most doctors aren’t trained to treat addiction, leaving patients without lifesaving care and leading to preventable deaths.

This work is personal: My brother died from substance use disorder. Behind every statistic is a family like mine, hoping for care that could save their loved one’s life.

With our federal funding cut by 60%, my team and I are unable to continue developing our addiction medicine curriculum and enrolling medical schools and clinicians into our program.

Meanwhile, addiction-related deaths continue to rise as the U.S. health system loses its capacity to deliver effective treatment. These setbacks ripple through hospitals and communities, perpetuating treatment gaps and deepening the addiction crisis.

Communities left to brave extreme weather alone

Brian G. Henning, Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies and Sciences, Gonzaga University

In 2021, a heat dome settled over the Northwest, shattering temperature records and claiming lives. Since that devastating summer, my team and I have been working with the City of Spokane to prepare for the climate challenges ahead.

We and the city were awarded a $19.9 million grant from the EPA to support projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build capacity to address environmental and climate justice challenges.

As our work was about to begin, the Trump administration rescinded our funding in May. As a result, the five public facilities that were set to serve as hubs for community members to gather during extreme weather will be less equipped to handle power failures. Around 300 low-income households will miss out on efficient HVAC system updates. And our local economy will lose the jobs and investments these projects would have generated.

Despite this setback, the work will continue. My team and I care about our neighbors, and we remain focused on helping our community become more resilient to extreme heat and wildfires. This includes pursuing new funding to support this work. It will be smaller, slower and with fewer resources than planned, but we are not deterred.

LGBTQ+ people made invisible

Nathaniel M. Tran, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Administration, University of Illinois Chicago

This year nearly broke me as a scientist.

Shortly after coming into office, the Trump administration began targeting research projects focusing on LGBTQ+ health for early termination. I felt demoralized after receiving termination letters from the NIH for my own project examining access to preventive services and home-based care among LGBTQ+ older adults. The disruption of publicly funded research projects wastes millions of dollars from existing contracts.

Then, news broke that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer process or make publicly available the LGBTQ+ demographic data that public health researchers like me rely on.

But instead of becoming demoralized, I grew emboldened: I will not be erased, and I will not let the LGBTQ+ community be erased. These setbacks renewed my commitment to advancing the public’s health, guided by rigorous science, collaboration and equity.

Pediatric brain cancer research squelched

Rachael Sirianni, Professor of Neurological Surgery, UMass Chan Medical School

My lab designs new cancer treatments. We are one of only a few groups in the nation focused on treating pediatric cancer that has spread across the brain and spinal cord. This research is being crushed by the broad, destabilizing impacts of federal cuts to the NIH.

Compared to last year, I am working with around 25% of our funding and less than 50% of our staff. We cannot finish our studies, publish results or pursue new ideas. We have lost technology in development. Students and colleagues are leaving as training opportunities and hope for the future of science dries up.

I’m faced with impossible questions about what to do next. Do I use my dwindling research funds to maintain personnel who took years to train? Keep equipment running? Bet it all on one final, risky study? There are simply no good choices remaining.

Inequality in science festers

Stephanie Nawyn, Associate Professor of Sociology, Michigan State University

Many people have asked me how the termination of my National Science Foundation grant to improve work cultures in university departments has affected me, but I believe that is the wrong question. Certainly it has meant the loss of publications, summer funding for faculty and graduate students, and opportunities to make working conditions at my and my colleagues’ institutions more equitable and inclusive.

But the greatest effects will come from the widespread terminations across science as a whole, including the elimination of NSF programs dedicated to improving gender equity in science and technology. These terminations are part of a broader dismantling of science and higher education that will have cascading negative effects lasting decades.

Infrastructure for knowledge production that took years to build cannot be rebuilt overnight.

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

These power grabs have had a profound effect on both democracy in the state and on the everyday lives of North Carolina residents, Democrats argue.

The changes are “weakening environmental protections, raising energy costs, and politicizing election administration,” Josh Stein, North Carolina’s governor, said in a text message responding to questions from ProPublica.

Republican leaders in the General Assembly did not respond to requests for comment or emailed questions about the power shifts. In the past, they have defended these actions as reflecting the will of voters, with the senate president describing one key bill as balancing “appointment power between the legislative and executive branches.”

Former state Sen. Bob Rucho, a Republican picked to sit on the state elections board after lawmakers shifted control from Stein to the Republican state auditor, said the changes would fix problems created by Democrats.

“Republicans are very proud of what’s been accomplished,” Rucho said. Shifting authority over the elections board, he argued, would “reestablish a level of confidence in the electoral process” that Democrats had lost.

ProPublica recently chronicled the nearly 10-year push to take over the board, which sets rules and settles disputes in elections in the closely divided swing state. Decisions made by the board’s new leadership — particularly on the locations and numbers of early voting sites — could affect outcomes in the 2026 midterms.

Below, we examine how other power transfers driven by North Carolina’s Republican legislature are reshaping everything from the regulations that protect residents’ drinking water to the rates they pay for electricity to the culture of their state university system.

What it is: The Environmental Management Commission adopts rules that protect the state’s air and water, such as those that regulate industries discharging potentially carcinogenic chemicals in rivers.

Power transfer: In October 2023, Republican legislators passed a law shifting the power to appoint the majority of the commission’s members from the governor to themselves and the state’s commissioner of agriculture, who is a Republican.

What’s happened since: The new Republican-led commission has stymied several efforts by the state’s Department of Environmental Quality to regulate a potentially harmful chemical, 1,4-dioxane, in drinking water.

Advocates for businesses, including the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, had criticized some regulations and urged the commission to intervene. “Clean water is worth the cost, but regulators should not arbitrarily establish a level that is low for the sake of being low,” the chamber said in a press release.

The Southern Environmental Law Center, which has pressed the state to regulate the chemical, has said the commission’s rulings are “crippling the state’s ability to protect its waterways, drinking water sources, and communities from harmful pollution.”

Utilities Commission

What it is: The North Carolina Utilities Commission regulates the rates and services of the state’s public utilities, which include providers of electricity, natural gas, water and telephone service. The commission also oversees movers, brokers, ferryboats and wastewater.

Power transfer: In June 2025, a trial court sided with the General Assembly in allowing a law passed in 2024 to take effect, removing the governor’s power to appoint a majority of the commission’s members and transferring that power to legislative leaders and the state treasurer, who is a Republican.

What’s happened since: The state’s primary utility, Duke Energy, has backed off from some plans to rely more on clean energy and retire coal-fired power plants. In November, the company said it would seek the commission’s approval to raise rates by 15%.

In response to a new resource plan the company filed in October, the executive director of NC WARN, a climate and environmental justice nonprofit, said in a statement that Duke’s actions would cause “power bills to double or triple over time” and increase carbon emissions. The state’s governor and attorney general, both Democrats, have said they oppose the rate hike.

Garrett Poorman, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, said that the company is “focused on keeping costs as low as possible while meeting growing energy needs across our footprint” and that the company had recently lowered its forecasted costs.

The commission will decide whether to approve the proposed rate hikes in 2026.

University of North Carolina System

What it is: The University of North Carolina System encompasses 17 institutions and more than 250,000 students, including at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, considered one of best in the nation.

Power transfer: Though the legislature has traditionally appointed the majority of the trustees for individual schools, the governor also made a share of these appointments.

In 2016, the legislature passed a law that eliminated the governor’s ability to make university trustee appointments.

In 2023, changes inserted into the state budget bill gave the legislature power to appoint all of the members of the state board that oversees community colleges and most of those colleges’ trustees. The governor had previously chosen some board members and trustees.

What’s happened since: The system has created a center for conservative thought, repealed racial equity initiatives, suspended a left-leaning professor, gutted a civil rights center led by a professor long critical of Republican lawmakers and appointed politically connected Republicans to the boards.

Republicans say the moves are reversing the system’s long-term leftward drift.

“Ultimately, the board stays in for a while, and you change administrators, and then start to moderate the culture of the UNC schools,” said David Lewis, a former Republican House member who helped drive the changes to the university system.

Democrats, including former Gov. Roy Cooper, have criticized the board changes as partisan meddling.

“These actions will ultimately hurt our state’s economy and reputation,” Cooper said in a 2023 press release.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-148932699.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 13:13:39.173887

A glance at the organization’s website reveals an alert that there is an “EMERGENCY NEED for type O blood” because winter weather has caused a decline in donations.

There’s even a pitch that if you donate by Jan. 4, you will receive a Red Cross long-sleeved t-shirt; and if you give blood before Jan. 31, you can earn points to be used toward rewards.

Local opportunities to give blood include 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. today, Jan. 9, 16, 23 and 30; Monday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Washington County Board of Developmental Disabilities in Marietta; Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Jan. 13 from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Grand Central Mall; Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m. at Gilman United Methodist Church in Marietta; Thursday from 1:30-6 p.m. at Mr. Zion Baptist Church in Mineral Wells; Jan. 15 from noon to 5 p.m. at the 36th Street Church of Christ multipurpose building in Vienna; Jan. 20 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Belpre Medical Campus — Memorial Health System, and Jan. 27 from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at Dyson Baudo Recreation Center in Marietta.

Generally speaking, donors can give blood approximately every 56 days, up to six times per year.

Platelet donors can give every seven days, up to 24 times per year.

And “AB elite plasma” donors can give every 28 days, up to 13 times a year.

On the other hand, there ARE some reasons a person cannot donate, or donate as frequently.

Check the eligibility requirements here: redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/eligibility-requirements.html. There’s a good chance there’s nothing stopping you.

But the Red Cross does more than provide blood services.

The organization also needs volunteers and financial donations.

Human help is required for its disaster relief efforts, international work and the support it gives military families.

This is not the first time we’ve observed it, but Tesla really isn’t a “car company” at this point. Elon Musk’s perpetual money machine has diversified into increasingly pointless and stupid directions over the years in its search of some kind of rationale for exactly why it should be valued in the trillions of dollars, most recently going all in on fake robots like Optimus, which Musk continues to tout for private home use despite the fact that in public appearances, the “robots” are still being remotely controlled by human beings so they can do such complex tasks as “walk around” and “pour drinks for people.” Falling by the wayside in all of this, meanwhile, is Tesla’s formerly world-leading edge in electric vehicles, and we can now formally say “formerly,” because Tesla has officially lost the title of the world’s biggest EV company. They’ve been significantly lapped by China’s BYD, which surged to 2.26 million EVs sold in 2025, while Tesla sold 1.64 million. That was a big decrease of 9% overall for Tesla from 2024, demonstrating the weakness of the brand both in the United States and abroad.

Much of Tesla’s slump can unsurprisingly be blamed directly on the spastic actions of Musk through the last few calendar years, as he completed his transformation from mere Twitter-buying troll to chief Donald Trump bootlicker, temporary shadow president and DOGE-lord. His effort to “cut government spending and waste” via the Department of Government Efficiency unsurprisingly ended up being a resounding failure, with most theoretical savings being impossible to quantify, eventually walked back, or simply replaced with new Republican spending, for a deficit that only continues growing. All the while, the Trump admin stabbed him in the back by ending the EV tax credits that incentivized consumers to buy electric vehicles. Musk himself has admitted that his time at DOGE was only “a little bit successful” (lol) at most, and that he wouldn’t even attempt to do it again if given the chance. Perhaps more important to Musk was the effect that his government cosplaying ended up having on public perception of Tesla and consumer interest in buying his cars, like the woeful failure of the Cybertruck. Oh, and he may have visited the Epstein Pedophile Island as well.

Tesla’s board has of course long been aware that Musk is somehow both their golden goose and the albatross around their neck, and in May of 2025 they reportedly grew tired enough of his bullshit that they were attempting to replace him as CEO with someone who might actually show a bit of interest in the duties of the job. Instead, however, the company reversed face by the end of the year and decided to reward Musk with a compensation package that could ultimately be worth $1 trillion in stock value … provided that the company continues growing its market cap to an absurd degree over the next decade. And as our own Jacob Weindling pointed out, that is hardly a given. To quote his amusingly acerbic take:

This is yet another big bet on AI, as the whole industry is pitching an Underpants Gnomes-style business plan where they build a bunch of data centers far outpacing the present-day demand for AI, have no fucking idea what to do next, then claim we will enter an age of unprecedented prosperity. AI is definitely here to stay to some degree, and OpenAI advertising themselves this week as too big to fail is one example of how we’re stuck with it, but the lesson from the dot com bust is that Amazon and Apple were big winners in large part because there were so many other losers.

And Tesla is a loser. It’s a carbon credits company that sells a couple of cars and launched a truck so shambolic and dangerous it makes the notoriously combustible Ford Pinto look like a Boeing Dreamliner by comparison. I have lived the lesson of never short a cult, and Tesla is the ultimate proof that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, but Tesla is the exact kind of Pets.com-ass bubble that got popped in the 2000s. It’s a pinky promise, not a company, and it’s a lot harder to survive through a bear market solely on pinky promises.

To wit, the stock price of Tesla has remained difficult to put a dent in, although the last week has been rough, sending it plunging almost 10% in total. Still, even so, that represents the company being up by roughly 15% in the last calendar year, and more than 86% in the last five years. But much of those gains were built on the back of a company that at least dominated one emerging industry in EVs. Now Tesla doesn’t even have that feather in its cap anymore, and few but the Musk acolytes seem to care about its stated intention to dominate the “fake household robots” industry. The only people who really want those things are the streamers and influencers who are very much looking forward to abusing a humanoid robot on camera for clicks.

It’s perfectly fitting, by the way, that China’s BYD would blow by Tesla as an EV maker, offering comparable quality vehicles at prices that Musk’s company has struggled to match, even after stripping features out of the Model Y and Model 3 in an effort to bring their sticker prices down … again necessary after Trump and co. ended tax credits for EV vehicles, even after Musk threw his weight and cash behind getting Trump elected. Years ago, Musk had mocked BYD in an interview when asked if he saw the company as a competitor, saying that their cars were of poor quality: “Have you seen their car? I don’t think it’s particularly attractive, the technology is not very strong, and BYD as a company has pretty severe problems in their home turf in China.”

Now, years later, Musk finds himself purposefully making his flagship EVs worse and less feature rich, in order to compete with those very same Chinese EV manufacturers he was once mocking. Who’s producing junk now? It’s enough to make you want to ask Optimus to poorly mix up a batch of drinks.

This year, TCD's resident auto experts are asking for some big changes that would make EVs cheaper, easier, and more fun to drive in the new year.

Here are eight clean machine-related resolutions we'd like to see coming to fruition in 2026:

Reinstate the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs

With American giants such as Ford taking billions of dollars in losses and opting to kill beloved EVs like the F-150 Lightning, reinstating these nixed tax incentives would be a way for the government to support the economy.

Get rid of the idea that EV drivers should be charged more

There's a whole lot of cost and confusion looming, as individual states decide how to tax EV drivers as a way of making up for lost gas tax revenue.

Let's make these laws common sense — and not a clear cash-grab or subversive plot to put people off buying EVs.

Allow Chinese EVs to be sold in the US

Doing so would mean radical changes to policy and tariffs, but it would also likely bring the average cost of an EV down considerably without sacrificing quality.

The added competition would put further pressure on U.S. and European manufacturers, and is that really such a bad thing?

Hurry up and bring sub-$25,000 EVs to market

Slate promises its new plug–and-play EV, due in 2026, will be around this price, but if the Chinese can make great electric vehicles far more cheaply, why can't we?

Right now, we're seeing some sub-$30,000 offerings on the horizon, but surely America's home-grown engineering and business savvy can crack the code on lower sticker prices.

Make all charging stations available to all EV owners — for a standard cost

This would be opposed to the wildly fluctuating costs across charging suppliers and states. The state of Indiana is currently trying something in this vein, with a pilot program that charges drivers the same amount regardless of where — or when — they charge.

Fix all those broken EV chargers

It's still too common to come across an outdated or broken charger (as witnessed on a recent drive up the northeastern coast). They give EVs a bad rap, and the property owners should be fined for hosting old or non-functioning equipment.

Explore new charging alternatives, like battery-swapping

The companies that are beta-testing this solution find it as quick as a gas station stop, and batteries can be optimized for longevity by keeping them charged to the most efficient maximum levels.

Allow EVs to make fun noises

If a Nissan Leaf could sound like a powerful V12 engine, wouldn't that be fun? Or, if you're an EV purist, why not let these cars make calming nature sounds. Best yet, let the owner choose their car's sonics, like Tesla does.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LtzLeESjhwH.Ze8gEokbxw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/94c1448035a899bb5cad74becf944d5f,N,,2026-01-03 18:59:26.120751

Source: Solar Farm Jobs vs. Coal Mine https://g.co/gemini/share/ee2e682031bb","Google gemeni. Is this true? The information in the image is mostly true but requires important context regarding employment.

​The project described is real. It is the CPV Backbone Solar farm in Garrett County, Maryland. It is indeed a ~160 MW (megawatt) facility built on a former coal mine (specifically a reclaimed strip mine near Backbone Mountain) and consists of over 300,000 panels.

​Here is the breakdown of the facts, particularly regarding the job numbers you requested:

​1. Is the project real?

​Yes.

​Name: CPV Backbone Solar (developed by Competitive Power Ventures).

​Location: Garrett County, Maryland, on a former coal strip mine (Arch Coal/Vindex/Mettiki vicinity).

​Scale: ~160 MW capacity with ~300,000+ panels.

​Status: Commercial operations began recently (late 2025).

​2. How many jobs are created with ongoing operations?

​This is where the comparison to coal mining is stark. While the image mentions ""hundreds of jobs"" for the local community, it specifies these were during the construction phase.

​Construction Jobs (Temporary): ~200 jobs.

​Building the solar farm created a significant spike in employment, but these jobs lasted only for the duration of construction (approx. 12–18 months).

Meanwhile, work on the 100 MW hydrogen project in Moorburg has started.","As the world rushes to meet the deadline of the global mission to achieve zero emissions by 2050, some still struggle to keep up with the ever-rising energy demands of a growing population, data centers, and especially AI. Fortunately, hydrogen has been discovered in America, and it’s enough to produce 104 MW and to power 25,000 homes. Discover how repurposing a molybdenum mine could end up generating clean energy to power the U.S., and perhaps even the world.

Hydrogen was found in America

The best way to reach the global zero-emission goal by 2050 is to ensure that fossil fuels become a thing of the past. In its place, renewable energies should be the primary source to produce clean energy. However, the efficiency of renewable power production varies depending on location and the associated weather patterns. For example, Oakridge, Tennessee, would not be ideal for a wind farm.

That is why Questa, New Mexico, is ideal for solar energy production, as it enjoys a high amount of sunshine each year. Mayor John Ortega also seems to think so, which is why he and the Village of Questa have teamed up with Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC). The challenge with solar production is the intermittency of the source and the storage of excess solar energy.

One of the most ingenious ways to store excess renewable energy is by utilising green hydrogen. Now, Questa will be getting a green hydrogen plant with the help of KCEC, and a $231 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Repurposing a molybdenum mine to generate clean energy

Green hydrogen plants have been popping up all over the world, including Germany’s 320 MW green hydrogen plant in Emden. In Questa, New Mexico, one of the most obvious places to build the new plant was the old Chevron Molybdenum mine. Mayor Ortega’s father worked in the mine for nearly 30 years until it was shut down in 2014.

The mine is presently in the middle of a substantial environmental rehabilitation process, which reportedly will continue until the 2040s. The USDA released an intermediate feasibility study in 2023, which explained that the plant will utilise reclaimed water from the old mine for hydrogen separation through electrolysis. This will be used for long-term energy storage in newly developed technology.

Enough to produce 104 MW and power 25,000 homes

The Chevron Molybdenum mine’s closure resulted in the loss of 50% of the jobs it had provided to the area. By repurposing the mine for the plant’s development, over 350 jobs will be established in the region. Additional advantages of the plant include:

70 local jobs for the hub and associated energy production

Increased tax revenue

Funding for

extra public safety officers

a full-time, professional EMS/fire-fighting team in an area prone to wildfire

The region will economically benefit from $298 million in the first five years

Enough clean power production to power 25,000 homes annually

Conversion of a brownfield into a greenfield development opportunity

Promotes the region’s sustainable way of life

When asked about Chevron’s millions of gallons of treated water in addition to the municipal wastewater, Mayor Ortega said:

“Might as well use it for something. It’s perfect use for it, it’s not going to waste. And we’re not using water from our well or the aquifer.”

While additional purification may be required for the water’s electrolysis process, the entire project will be primarily beneficial for the entire Taos County, especially the Village of Questa. The USDA has only granted $500,000 for a safety study, which is presently being conducted by KCEC, and will hopefully bring the community some peace of mind. So far, operational dates have not been confirmed.

By Amy Kuras

To see the beautiful house on McClellan Ave., impeccably kept with colorful flowerbeds in front and a charming gazebo in the back, you’d never imagine it was once just another abandoned Detroit house awaiting a wrecking ball.

Thanks to a dedicated nonprofit, Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance, and a hardworking couple, Lynne and Johnnie Williams, the house that could have been fated to be a cloud of dust and an empty lot is a thriving asset in a stable neighborhood – and its owners, once in the grip of substance abuse, are assets to their community as well.

Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance has been buying and renovating single-family homes and apartments in Detroit’s Gratiot Woods neighborhood for nearly 20 years. Founded in the wake of the 1967 uprising, the alliance has worked to engage community members in the social, moral, and political issues of the day and to actively work against racism.

Housing connects to that in many ways – a lack of access to homeownership, for example, means Black families have exponentially less generational wealth available to them than white families.

For DCPA, creating safe, affordable, well-maintained housing means stabilizing a neighborhood that serves as an important gateway to the city. DCPA renovated its first home, donated by a parish member in 2006, and has since built or renovated five multi-family projects in the neighborhood and several more single-family homes.

Redeeming homes, redeeming people

One of those homes went to the Williams family, owners of the caringly maintained home on McClellan. Their own story parallels that of their home.

“We’ve always said this was the house God had for us all along because, just like us, it was on the demolition list, and, just like us, it was completely restored,” says Lynne Williams. She and her husband Johnnie were both struggling with drug addiction, but were able to get clean and sober 15 years ago.

Once they were out of treatment and trying to create a new and positive life for themselves, they wanted to leave the neighborhood they had been in and move away from bad influences. One day, Williams was driving down Gratiot and saw one of the apartment projects DCPA had renovated. She called, and they landed the last apartment available in the building.

A few years later, they decided they wanted to move into homeownership. Because their experience renting from DCPA was so positive, they reached out to the organization to see what else was available. The house on McClellan was under renovation, and Williams admits she was very skeptical at first. “I didn’t know how they were going to renovate it!” she said.

After extensive work on the house, they moved in during 2017 and have been making it their own ever since. They now have three rescue dogs and two cats, have put extensive efforts into beautifying the home, and they even hosted a wedding for Lynne Williams’ best friend in early September. Williams is also a community representative on the board at DCPA.

Due to the Williams’ history, they would not have qualified for a traditional mortgage. DCPA worked with them on a land contract to allow them to buy their home. DCPA also frequently uses what is called a “soft second mortgage,” where the organization is in second position in financing the house and will reap some of its investment when it sells.

Stabilizing a neighborhood

Because the nonprofit’s goal is neighborhood stabilization, it also requires that homeowners not sell the home for a designated period of time. This avoids issues with someone flipping the home quickly instead of investing in the neighborhood, as intended.

“The way that we’re looking at it now is mostly as a way to be able to complete these projects without a subsidy and to bring up property values in the neighborhood and also to encourage home ownership,” says Cleophus Bradley, executive director of the Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance. “We don’t want them leaving and cashing out any type of equity they may have in the home. You want them to have a stake in the community for at least five years.”

DCPA accomplishes its mission through a variety of financing methods, including taking advantage of available subsidies through the City of Detroit and the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. A bequest from a priest at the Church of the Nativity in the neighborhood means they can currently complete most projects without a subsidy. This is advantageous, as subsidies create more red tape and can slow down development.

Previous building projects also help fund the work, either through profits from homes sold or from rental income at one of the apartment projects DCPA has renovated.

”We’ve survived throughout the years because we haven’t relied on one particular source of income the whole time. And even as it relates to income from our real estate portfolio, we have a good mix of commercial and residential,“ says Christopher Bray, DCPA director of housing and finance.

“We’ve got something special going on in the neighborhood, in terms of the different types of housing available and the kind of investment that we put in, both in terms of actual bricks and mortar, repaving alleys and neighborhood beautification, and then also community organizing and things of that nature,” Bray says.

Meeting the need for affordable homes

DCPA is one of several organizations in the city attempting to address the affordable housing crisis in a city that’s rapidly changing and with an uncertain federal funding environment. Lisa Johanon, executive director and housing director of Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corporation, says it’s unclear what the future might hold for affordable housing.

“We don’t know what the final outcome of the federal government’s funding is, as it relates to CDBG [Community Development Block Grant Program] and HOME [HOME Investment Partnerships Program] funds,” she says, noting that at one point this year those funds were entirely gone from the federal government and then were restored.

“That’s going to have severe implications on affordable housing going forward,” she says, “I’m not being optimistic, that’s for sure.”

Another issue is the rapidly rising home prices in the North End, where Central Detroit CDC is located. Johanon says it’s not as simple as pointing fingers at gentrifiers coming in and making neighborhoods unaffordable.

A $200,000 house that would have sold for half that a few years ago may be out of the price range of a traditional resident of the neighborhood, but it also means the longtime resident whose home may have been worth considerably less several years ago is now able to see a return on the financial and emotional investment they have made in the neighborhood over decades.

Central Detroit Christian CDC is focused on children, and housing is an outgrowth of that mission to educate and care for children. That’s because once a family finds stable housing, all sorts of other potential issues are headed off.

A stable home means children are not moving schools constantly, the family’s stress is lessened, and the parents can plan a future because they know what their housing costs will be and that their investment will most likely appreciate in value, allowing them to build wealth.

To that end, Central Detroit Christian CDC offers training and counseling for potential homebuyers, ensuring they understand the costs of homeownership, how financing works, and how to avoid foreclosure or eviction. The organization also provides other services, such as child care and after-school programs for children, that ease families’ overall financial burden.

“If we put you in a house and you’re paying 50% of your income, which so many Detroiters are, something catches up so that you can’t pay this bill or that bill. And eventually it becomes your rent,” she says. “We want to have enough services for you, if that’s what you need. We’d rather work with folks that way.”",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Story-7_Resilient-Neighborhoods1.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 10:58:15.668367

While offering several worthy recommendations, the report is also plagued by backsliding, lowering of targets, false solutions, and an overall lack of emergency-level ambition.

Article content

Article content

To start with the positives: Expanding programs that enable access to clean home heating and cooling options, like heat pumps, is critical. Heat pumps are significantly more energy efficient than gas furnaces, helping lower energy bills while cutting climate pollution. The recommendation to reduce hydro rates for lower-income households is also welcome.

Article content

Article content

The reviewers also recommend increasing funding for active transportation and public transit, noting that the current provincial budget falls far short of what is required. Investing in active transportation creates significant public health and affordability benefits.

Article content

Additionally, the report’s support of a Youth Climate Corps (YCC) is welcome. Included in the 2025 federal budget, a YCC will become reality in April 2026 as a federal public jobs program for young Canadians. If the B.C. government cost-matches this program, even more young people can start building green careers.

Risks of LNG

Article content

The report takes a nuanced stance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansion. It outlines many risks, including the “staggering” demand for clean electricity required for electrifying LNG facilities, the volatility of gas prices, economic risks of entering into the global LNG market, the uncertainty around future demand for B.C.’s LNG, and the likelihood of a looming supply glut.

Article content

Article content

It also notes that LNG expansion will escalate conflicts with First Nations Rights and Title Holders (conflicts already instigating legal battles), harm the health of communities where the gas is fracked, and require billions in taxpayer dollars, with inadequate payoff in terms of jobs and benefits for British Columbians.

Article content

Despite all this, the review falls short of calling for what is needed: an immediate end to LNG expansion.

Article content

Weakening ambitious targets

Article content

The review falls flat in a number of other ways. It claims that emission reduction targets deemed “unrealistic” can “backfire … (leading) to either rollback or inaction.” It thus recommends lowering the 2030 target for EV adoption to 50 to 60 per cent (rather than 90 per cent) and completely removing the ban on sales of new gas-powered vehicles set for 2035.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/vancouversun/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0801-eby-lng-2_297957516.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 18:59:17.643154

Tesla reported a nearly 9% decline in global car deliveries for 2025, selling 1.64 million vehicles worldwide, marking the second consecutive year of falling deliveries for the company.

Meanwhile, BYD announced that its battery-powered vehicle sales grew by almost 28% in 2025, reaching more than 2.25 million units sold.

Tesla cited a challenging year, including a mixed reception to new product offerings, political scrutiny surrounding CEO Elon Musk, and increasing pressure from Chinese competitors.

BYD’s surge in global EV sales comes as Tesla faces slowing deliveries, intensifying Chinese competition, and mounting pressure from pricing, the expiry of U.S. tax credits, and growing brand backlash.

In the final quarter of 2025, Tesla’s deliveries declined by 16%. The drop was partially attributed to the expiration of a U.S. government subsidy that had provided up to $7,500 off the price of certain electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles.

Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their sales projections for Tesla in 2026, signaling a more cautious outlook for the company.

Chinese manufacturers such as Geely, MG, and BYD have gained market share by pricing their EVs lower than established Western brands while, according to some reviewers, delivering vehicles of competitive quality.

In response, Tesla introduced lower-cost versions of its two best-selling models in the United States in October, aiming to boost demand.",https://www.brandinginasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BYD-Atto-3.webp,N,,2026-01-03 18:59:06.144144

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

Last year, BYD saw a 28% in sales by selling 2.26 million vehicles. Notably, BYD did not make any sales to American consumers.

Meanwhile, Tesla, which was riddled with controversy due to CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration, sold 1.64 million vehicles last year, marking a 9% drop in sales from the year prior. 2025 marked the second year in a row that Musk’s company experienced a slump in yearly sales.

With Musk taking on the role of leading the Department of Government Efficiency at the beginning of Trump’s second term, he was met with widespread criticism by government employees and liberals alike for his cavalier approach in administrating widespread firings and audits of the federal government.

Protests at Tesla showrooms and dealerships erupted across the country to pushback against Musk. Many of these “Tesla Takedown” campaigns turned violent with showrooms vandalized and vehicles set on fire.

By the end of Tesla’s first quarter, Tesla saw a 71% drop in earnings. Shortly after, Musk announced he would be ending his role with the Trump administration. However, his announcement also corresponded with the end of his 130 day legal limit as a special government employee.

Tesla has also had to navigate the Trump administration’s decision to not extend a $7,500 federal EV tax credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The EV tax credit expired in September.

The tax credit repeal’s impact on prices

Article content

Article content

The expiration of the 30% federal tax credit for solar and battery installations at the end of 2025 doesn’t necessarily make the equipment more costly to buy but for homeowners with a tax liability, it does end the ability to reduce or erase their tax bill. A typical solar and battery system generated tax credits worth about $10,000.

You can still save by leasing

Article content

Tax credits remain for leased solar systems through the end of 2027, though the installer receives the incentive and passes on the savings to homeowners through lower monthly payments or other cost reductions.

Article content

A new model of solar ownership is emerging

Article content

Walker said installers who sold systems are now switching to a new model that lets residents ultimately own their solar and battery arrays while securing the savings from leasing. Called lease-to-own or a prepaid lease, a homeowner pays for the cost of the system upfront and the installer passes on the tax credit benefits as a discount. The solar company must retain ownership for a certain number of years under the tax code but then transfers title to the homeowner.

Article content

Article content

Southern California installer SolarShoppers sells its systems but company president Shawn Heckerman said he estimates that prepaid leases will account for nearly all of his business in 2026. Like other solar installers, he anticipates that demand will initially soften but recover later in the year. “I expect us to have a better year in 2026 than the last one, even with the tax credit expiring,” he said.

Article content

That’s due to soaring electricity rates and temperatures that force residents to run their air conditioners. “When we get into the summer, customer calls spike when they get their first high utility bill,” said Heckerman.

Article content

Walker also expects homeowners to continue adding panels as they install electric vehicle chargers and replace fossil fuel appliances with induction stoves and heat pumps. That can make going solar still financially attractive in the long run, even if the absence of federal incentives means adding a couple of years to the time it takes for the energy savings to equal the cost of the system, she said.",,N,,2026-01-03 16:57:48.046086

Jumping right into the numbers, Tesla delivered 418,227 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2025. That compares to 495,570 units a year ago and this represents a 15.6 percent drop.

Interestingly, sales of “Other Models” – including the Model S, X, and Cybertruck – plummeted from 23,640 to 11,642. That’s a decline of 50.8 percent and it shows the company’s wedge-shaped pickup continues to be a flop.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1,636,129 vehicles. That’s down from 1,789,226 in 2024, marking an 8.6 percent decrease overall.

Tesla Q4 2025 Sales

Tesla didn’t have much to say about the disappointing numbers, but the company will reveal their full financial results on January 28. However, the Q4 numbers were worse than the original estimate of 422,850 vehicles. This also meant the full year sales total fell below projections.

While the numbers weren’t too far off, projections for Other Models was laughably wrong as they indicated the company would sell 34,848 units in the fourth quarter. However, they only managed to move 11,642, which means those estimates were off by nearly 300 percent.

Tesla 2025 Sales

On the bright side, the automaker did reveal one positive development and that was a record deployment of 14.2 GWh worth of energy storage products in the fourth quarter. That brought their full year number to 46.7 GWh, which is a substantial increase from the 31.4 GWh deployed in 2024.

While Tesla didn’t delve into specifics, the company’s problems are well-known. Outspoken CEO Elon Musk alienated a number of his customers by joining the Trump Administration and slashing the federal workforce in a sometimes haphazard fashion. The company also had to deal with increased competition and the elimination of federal tax credits, which caused sales to slump at Rivian.

BYD Outsells Tesla

Tesla’s disappointing showing means they’re no longer the best-selling electric vehicle brand in the world. As BBC News reported, BYD sold 2,256,714 EVs last year, which put them 620,585 units ahead of Tesla.

However, this shouldn’t come as much of a surprise as Tesla was barely hanging onto the title. The company’s 1,789,226 sales in 2024 was just ahead of BYD’s total of 1,777,965.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tesla-CybertruckTBR-GFG-FV.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 07:12:31.586484

In the U.S., investments in renewable, non-polluting energy were rolled back, and policy moves like the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” and the Environmental Protection Agency's reconsidering a key part of the federal government’s legal authority to regulate emissions.

However, other nations have continued to make policy progress on prioritizing renewable energy and protecting the environment, and so have some scientists and groups on this side of the Atlantic.

Here are a few of the highs and lows of humanity’s effect on our planet this year.

The bad news first

Goal of keeping warming to 2.7 degrees no longer realistic

Humans have failed to keep global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, long considered the goal following the original Paris climate agreement, according to UN Secretary General António Guterres. “Overshooting is now inevitable,” he said.

Scientists widely consider the 2.7 degree goal the point at which climate change will begin hitting its most severe, irreversible damage.

“We don’t want to see the Amazon as a savannah. But that is a real risk if we don’t change course and if we don’t make a dramatic decrease of emissions as soon as possible,” Guterres said ahead of the 2025 UN climate summit COP30, urging humanity to change course immediately.

COP30 fails to make substantive progress

Unfortunately, the outcomes from that UN summit did not live up to the secretary general’s hopes. This summit is an annual meeting where member countries measure their progress on addressing climate change and agree to legally binding goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

However, this final decision coming out of this year’s summit only included new voluntary initiatives to accelerate national climate action. According to commentary from the World Resources Institute, more than 80 countries advocated for a “global roadmap” to guide the transition away from fossil fuels, but negotiators didn’t include it in the final decision after they faced opposition from countries whose economies are built largely on oil and gas extraction and exports.

World passes first climate ‘tipping point’

This year, the world passed its first climate ""tipping point,"" meaning a threshold of irreversible change. Warming oceans have caused mass death in coral reefs, which are some of the world’s most diverse ecosystems. These reefs support a quarter of marine life and a billion people.

Other tipping points, such as the devastation of the Amazon rainforest and melting ice sheets, are also approaching, scientists warn.

Record-setting days of heat in major cities

The world’s major cities now experience a quarter more very hot days every year on average than they did three decades ago, according to a September analysis by the International Institute for Environment and Development.

“This isn’t a problem we can simply air-condition our way out of,” said Anna Walnycki, a principal researcher, in a press release. “Fixing it requires comprehensive changes to how neighbourhoods and individual buildings are designed, as well as bringing nature back into our cities in the form of trees and other plants.

“Climate change is the new reality. Governments can’t keep their heads buried in the sand anymore.”

Where positive action made a difference

Global renewable energy generation surpasses coal for first time

This year, expanding solar and wind power infrastructure led to record shifts away from fossil fuels and toward renewables. Wind and solar farms produced more electricity than coal plants for the first time, a massive shift for power generation worldwide.

According to a report from climate think tank Ember, in the first six months of the year, renewable energy overtook the global demand for electricity. The world generated almost a third more solar power in the first half of the year than it did in the same period last year, meeting a whopping 83% of the global increase in demand for electricity.

Solar installations were up 64% around the globe after the first half of the year, driven largely by China, whose solar installations more than doubled compared to last year. Solar installations rose in the U.S. by only 4%, however.

Pennsylvania children see drop in asthma after a coal plant closed

After a coking plant closed near Pittsburgh, the population living in the area saw an immediate 20.5% drop in weekly respiratory trips to the emergency room, according to a study published almost 10 years later. Even more encouraging was that over the immediate term, pediatric emergency department visits decreased by 41.2%, a trend that increased as the months went on. The region also saw lower hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide.

Congestion toll drops emissions in NYC by 22%

In January, New York City became the first in the country to put in place a toll on drivers in certain parts of the city during rush hours. The measure was intended to reduce traffic and improve health. During the first six months of the policy, NYC emissions dropped 22%.

The SunZia Wind and Transmission project will be a renewable energy corridor that will link New Mexico to Arizona, meeting the growing power demand in the West. With the demand for electricity on the rise, the SunZia 3, which is a 3,650 MW wind farm, is permitting the integration of renewable energy generation on a large scale. SunZia will be the largest renewable energy project, which is set to provide power to over 1.2 million households.

A Western clean energy project to keep track of

This 3.5 MW wind farm will be located in central New Mexico and will consist of 916 turbines, 10 collection substations, 115 mi of overhead collection lines, and 130 mi of 345 kV AC generation. This surely is one of the largest wind installations throughout the United States.

The system is a rather huge engineering feat, with a transmission line set to carry power westward from Corona, New Mexico, and then to a converter station near Casa Grande, Arizona. SunZia can deliver more energy, which is far more stable power with fewer energy losses. There were over 80 organizations that contributed throughout the development timeline of this wind farm. With six years of construction and 17 years of permitting issues, the energy project posed a series of regulatory challenges that have been reflected throughout modern expansions.

The engineering challenge behind such a project

While the building of SunZia will resolve many technical problems along the way, there surely are engineering challenges to be dealt with. The transmission structures themselves are more than 2,000 structures, made from steel. A hybrid system was considered, where underground segments are used along with overhead construction lines. Overhead conductors can provide power to underground cables, resulting in savings of almost $45 million.

For this project, 2,000 workers and many helicopter fleets were called upon to handle the engineering challenge of such a project. These workers had to access difficult terrain as well; however, the jobs that were created included jobs for:

Electrical engineers

Studies and system planners

Civil engineers

Structural engineers

Material manufacturing and testing engineers

Geotechnical engineers

Environmental engineers

The success of this project would signify that large-scale infrastructure can be designed and built in the U.S., and that too within a rather reasonable time period. As it stands, it will take five years for the completion of the wind farm and six years for the full completion of the HDVC line, along with two years of field construction.

SunZia is setting an entirely new benchmark for U.S. clean energy

The expected economic benefits gained from this project amount to more than $20.5 billion, including direct and indirect economic benefits. SunZia is setting the benchmark for clean energy infrastructure. This is surely a step in the right direction in terms of large-scale renewable generation and long-distance transmission that can be delivered within a manageable timeline. Many states, on their own, are looking to power all of America, and with this initiative, climate change issues and global warming will be somewhat reduced.

The year of extended range EVs This year, a new trend will likely change the vehicle market in the US.","The year that ended brought a great deal of unpredictability to the automotive industry, especially regarding electric vehicles and battery technologies. It's difficult to make predictions in such an unstable environment, when decisions are made based on vibes and whims, only to be reversed days or weeks later.

This was, at least, the case with tariffs, which threatened to grind the automotive industry to a halt. Raw materials and many individual parts and components cross the US borders several times as they are processed, manufactured, and installed in new vehicles. In this case, the final products can add tariffs at various stages of the supply chain, making everything more expensive for everyone.

Thankfully, just as suddenly as they were announced, tariffs were also scrapped or lowered to bearable amounts. They did make the business environment more difficult for companies, while raising prices for consumers. However, since everyone had to pay them, they had little effect on the market dynamics.

2025 has been a mixed bag

When it comes to electric vehicles, the current administration has proved more consistent in rejecting them. The cancellation of the EV tax credit has been, undoubtedly, the most consequential event of 2025. The policy change caused a spike in EV sales in the months that preceded the end of the subsidy. The market is still adjusting to this change, and we're yet to see how bad the EV sales have been in the fourth quarter.

Tesla offered for the first time what financial analysts call ""company-compiled consensus"" regarding the fourth quarter sales. To be fair, the carmaker provided such analysis to select investors by mail, but this is the first time the estimates were published on the company's investor relations webpage.

Why has Tesla taken such a drastic change, you might ask? Your guess is just as good as mine, but many speculated that Tesla's delivery numbers were so bad that investors needed to be prepared in advance. This was confirmed on January 2, when Tesla reported even worse delivery numbers than Wall Street estimates.

Whatever the case, the 2025 delivery numbers mark two consecutive years of shrinking sales for Tesla. This is a direct consequence of abandoning the fight in manufacturing, something that became obvious in 2024. If you think that Tesla is doing a lousy job at selling EVs, just take a step back and have a look at the EV market as a whole.

Legacy carmakers are abandoning the EV race one by one

Liberated from the constraints of strict emissions regulations, legacy carmakers seized the opportunity to return to business as usual. In their case, it was and always will be building combustion engines. While this provides a brief relief as they return to their comfort zone, it's not going to help them in the long term.

As Ford CEO Jim Farley admitted, the Blue Oval is a global company now, and most of its sales are done abroad. Even if tariffs and lax regulations might help it in the US, Chinese carmakers will wipe the floor with it in Europe and Asia. Yet, somehow, Ford is happy abandoning the fight and expanding its combustion engine programs in North America against previous EV plans.

Indeed, Ford recently announced it is cancelling their large-EV program, including the F-150 Lightning full-size truck. Its only pure-electric plans are now tied to the work of its much-hyped ""Skunkworks team"" and the midsize EVs that it works on. Ford has taken a page out of Tesla's book here, unveiling both a cutting-edge EV platform and a new manufacturing process that is more efficient than anything used at present.

This sounds a lot like the Unboxed Vehicle manufacturing process that Tesla unveiled alongside the next-gen EVs. However, Tesla basically abandoned this project to focus on the Cybercab, the autonomous vehicle based on the new platform. The Cybercab is still promised to use the new manufacturing process, although we won't know for sure until it launches later this year.

It's not just Ford that is walking back previous bold claims about EV projects. GM is also scaling back its EV ambitions, despite announcing more affordable models. The upcoming Chevy Bolt is a prime example, although the Bow Tie company already warned that it would only be built in limited numbers. There aren't new EV models expected soon from GM, which might indicate that it would likely follow Ford's path.

In retrospect, Stellantis looks inspired to have delayed launching new electric vehicles, as they are no longer needed in the US market. The only two EVs Stellantis launched in North America are the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Jeep Wagoneer S, and they are selling so badly that they make Tesla Cybertruck look like a resounding success. The recently-launched Jeep Recon EV will likely have a similar fate. Fret not, though, I'm sure Stellantis is already working on adding a gas engine as a range extender to make it more compelling.

Young companies are approaching the make-or-break moment

Not everyone is taking the recent policy changes as a cue that electric vehicles are dead. EV startups, which don't stand a chance competing with legacy carmakers on their ICE turf, are forced to press ahead. Besides that, this is the sensible thing to do, considering that the car market is poised to be dominated by electric vehicles, no matter how some people feel about them. As Agent Smith said in Matrix Revolutions: ""Not impossible. Inevitable.""

Very few people who experienced electric mobility are indeed willing to go back to driving a combustion vehicle. Electric cars require a drastic routine change compared to ICE vehicles, taking into account charging stops and whatnot. However, once people become familiar with the new routine, going to a gas station no longer seems natural and straightforward. When charging at home, you wake up every day to a full tank.

There are other marked advantages of driving an EV, starting with the ultimate comfort of not having to deal with noise and smells. Add to this the instant acceleration that a combustion engine can't easily replicate, unless we're talking about supercars. Finally, maintenance is minimal on an electric car, which has very few moving parts compared to a gas-fueled vehicle.

These factors will compound to reward the companies that make it to the other side when the EV adoption tipping point is crossed. So far, it doesn't look like there will be many legacy carmakers among them. Almost all have abandoned the fight in the EV arena for the comfort and short-term gains of continuing to sell gas-powered vehicles.

However, being an all-EV carmaker doesn't guarantee success in itself. Not even Tesla, with its seemingly infinite cash coffers, is 100% safe in this fast-moving environment. Tesla has essentially abandoned the EV manufacturing race, scrapping almost all new vehicle programs. Its pivot to autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence will not guarantee a seat at the automotive industry's table.

Rivian and Lucid continue to struggle towards profitability, although the two have chosen very different paths. Lucid is focusing on being an EV manufacturer and has just announced expanding its manufacturing facilities in the Middle East. Lucid currently assembles vehicles there, but will move to local part sourcing and production in 2026. However, unless it changes something in its strategy, this is a narrow road to nowhere.

The AI-Defined Vehicle (ADV) era has begun

The world has moved toward software-defined vehicles or, as Rivian announced during the Q4 2025 earnings call, AI-Defined Vehicles. Rivian might be seen as a small company now, but its ambitions are huge, and the vision is enlightening. Rivian is no longer content with expanding its vehicle lineup and market share. It also wants to dominate in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, much like Tesla.

Before dismissing its efforts, pointing out Tesla's own struggles on this road, we should consider the vastly different conditions each company operates in. Tesla was a trendsetter and tried several strategies before deciding on its Vision-only, end-to-end AI approach. Rivian doesn't need to waste time and resources in this direction, because it has already seen at Tesla that it doesn't lead anywhere.

Rivian is, thus, able to burn through development stages much quicker, and early experience shows that it might get to Tesla's level faster than anyone thought possible. However, there's still a significant disadvantage for the EV startup: it doesn't have many vehicles in its fleet, so the data collection might lack variation, especially the edge cases that help refine its autonomous driving models.

Rivian tries to replace this with simulations running in the Amazon cloud. This means that it might not need expensive data centers that Tesla already has up and running, at least for now. However, this approach might not provide the same high-quality data processing capabilities that its more established rival has in place. It's exciting watching how this clash between Tesla and Rivian will unfold in 2026, especially as this will change everything we know about cars.

Legacy carmakers are doomed to fail

The question that is on everyone's mind right now is, where do the traditional carmakers sit in this landscape? Well, a mass extinction event might not happen in 2026, but I am not very optimistic about their fate. Some will fare better than others, but the end of 2026 will bring a significantly different car market than what we see today. What we know is that Volkswagen positioned itself preemptively alongside Rivian in the AI-Defined Vehicle era. We've already seen the first fruits of this collaboration in the form of the Rivian Assistant. This very clever AI assistant has been developed by the Rivian-Volkswagen software joint venture, which means that both brands will benefit.

Korean carmakers (Hyundai and Kia) have also made efforts on the software-defined vehicle front, although they are behind the market leaders in this endeavor. Other legacy carmakers, like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have stepped up their EV game, but they're still far from catching up in software with Rivian and Tesla. Meanwhile, the Detroit Three, and especially Stellantis, look doomed to fail sooner rather than later.

Exciting new EV models expected in 2026

While most car companies have been retreating from the EV market, with fewer models planned to launch, others have still maintained their ambitions unaltered. The most exciting launch of the year is undoubtedly the Rivian R2, which should start sales in the coming months. This will provide an insight into Rivian's AI-Defined Vehicle program, although not from the start.

Rivian opted for a controversial approach, with the most advanced features missing on the first R2 vehicles built in 2026. These include Rivian's next-generation autonomous driving computer, built around the company's first in-house SoC, called RAP001. The first R2 vehicles will also lack LiDAR, which seems like a missed opportunity considering how badly Rivian needs to collect this data for its autonomous driving software.

Early adopters are essentially left out of the most exciting features promised on the R2. This will almost certainly make many postpone the purchase until after Rivian starts equipping the R2 with all the promised features, both hardware- and software-wise. However, things are on the last final now, and we should see everything aligning by the end of the year. Or, on the contrary, crumbling, if this omission botches the R2 launch.

By the end of 2026, Slate Auto is also planning to start production of its affordable Slate EVs. These should prove either a huge hit or a monumental flop, depending on the market conditions at the time and the customer preferences. If a basic EV will be what people want, Slate Auto might have a win. However, if Ford succeeds in offering its midsize truck at the reasonable price it promised in 2027, Slate Auto's career might be incredibly short.

Sadly, there's no exciting new car brewing in Tesla's gigafactories. That is, if we don't count the Cybercab, which should launch sometime this year. We're yet to see what Tesla would make out of it, whether it would have a steering wheel, or if it will hit the promised features, specifications, and price. Tesla has also been promising the second-generation Roadster for some years already, but it's hard to believe it is actually working on it. I don't expect it to surface in 2026, if ever.

On the legacy carmakers' front, there are some highly desirable models preparing to start their US career. Among them are the BMW iX3 (Neue Klasse) and the crossovers built on Mercedes-Benz's MMA platform, the GLA and GLB. As much as the CLA EV is concerned, despite its impressive capabilities, the market is no longer favorable for new sedans, which means it will not make a significant impact, especially as it will launch without 400-volt capabilities.

The year of extended range EVs

This year, a new trend will likely change the vehicle market in the US. For the first time, there are several extended-range EVs planned to launch this year. Among them is the Ram 1500 REV, which was once supposed to be an all-electric pickup truck. Other carmakers are also preparing EREVs, with notable examples being Scout Traveler and Terra, as well as the successor to the Ford F-150 Lightning. However, they will not arrive earlier than 2027, with some planned for 2028.

This puts Stellantis in an awkward trendsetter position. It also means that its rivals will have time to assess whether an EREV is viable. Stellantis plans not one, but two EREV models this year, with the Jeep Wagoneer S also scheduled for an ICE transplant later this year. However, it's the Ram 1500 REV that people are looking more anxiously at.

Electric pickups have been unsuccessful so far, with many citing the limited range and lackluster towing capabilities. If a range extender is the cure to electric pickup truck problems, the Ram 1500 REV should provide the decisive answer. Many expect miracles from an extended-range pickup truck, but it remains to be seen if people are willing to pay significantly more than for either a gas or EV pickup just to have ""the best of both worlds.""",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/what-s-next-in-2026-electric-passenger-cars-trucks-and-suvs-263518_1.jpeg,N,,2026-01-03 07:12:36.121534

Bourbon Street terror

The news cycle opened on New Year's Eve with tragedy in New Orleans as a man drove a truck into crowds celebrating on Bourbon Street and then exchanged gunfire with police. The attack killed 14 people and injured at least 57 before the suspect was shot and killed. Nearly a year later, state officials still viewed it as a defining event for how the city plans security around major gatherings.

Attorney General Liz Murrill ordered state investigators to review the security planning and execution around New Year’s Eve and the Sugar Bowl game that coincides with the holiday.

On Monday, Murrill said a federal report has been completed and was being discussed with the city and its law enforcement partners. Security measures for this year's events included closing streets, searching bags and deploying around 800 local, state and federal law enforcement officers in the downtown area.

Federal interventions

In the closing weeks of the year, federal Border Patrol agents targeted the New Orleans area for the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown. Hundreds of arrests were made as the administration said it was looking for immigrants with criminal histories. Protesters, criticizing the agents' aggressive tactics and arrests of some citizens without criminal pasts, attended a City Council meeting that was eventually halted.

At the same time, the Louisiana National Guard grew more visible. About 350 Guard members were authorized to patrol New Orleans during New Year’s Eve festivities and remain through February during Carnival season.

Data center boom

Louisiana secured a massive $10 billion data center from Facebook parent Meta that drew heavy scrutiny. Filings and reporting around the project put at least $470 million of related infrastructure costs on Entergy ratepayers, as Meta and Entergy detailed broader transmission and generation plans to meet the site’s enormous electricity demand.

With more large-load projects circling Louisiana, regulators agreed to fast-track new power resources as part of the state’s “lightning speed” pitch to big employers that raised the stakes of long-term decisions for customers and the grid.

Another billion-dollar data center was announced the week before Christmas in West Feliciana Parish, and Shreveport approved a permit for a large data center in the western portion of the city.

Redistricting

As states across the country ramped up efforts to redraw their congressional maps, Louisiana joined them in a particularly significant case. Led by Attorney General Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, both Republicans, the state challenged a major portion of the Voting Rights Act before the U.S. Supreme Court.

If successful, state lawmakers will be able to redraw a map that would not require a second Black-majority district. This would almost certainly lead other states to redraw their maps, potentially limiting the ability of Black voters and other minority groups to use the law to force additional majority-minority districts.

Carbon capture

At the state Capitol, carbon capture and sequestration remained one of the year’s biggest policy divides. Lawmakers advanced a narrow bill after hours of testimony and widespread public pushback against proposals viewed as either too permissive or too restrictive. Several bills never made it out of committee.

One that broke through, Senate Bill 73, aimed to elevate local-government input in certain sequestration decisions. Gov. Landry later ordered a pause on new applications in the carbon storage permitting pipeline while the state focused on a backlog of pending reviews.

Rural Louisianas who oppose the projects organized a Facebook group with over 10,000 members, shared their concerns at local government meetings and received support from various state legislators.

Budget crisis

New Orleans' finances worsened in 2025, and by September major cuts were needed to offset hundreds of millions of dollars. City leaders froze hiring, announced furloughs and proposed changing the city charter to put hard limits on future spending.

New Orleans secured a $125 million state loan to cover its expenses after Gov. Landry suggested a financial takeover. The loan instead includes strict oversight from the state.

The financial issues will pass to the city's next mayor, Helena Moreno, a Democrat and city council vice president who was elected in October to succeed term-limited LaToya Cantrell.

Cantrell made news in August when she was indicted on federal charges that accused her of defrauding the city to hide a relationship with a police officer assigned to protect her. Cantrell has pleaded not guilty.",https://delta.creativecirclecdn.com/lpn/original/20260102-101714-290-LA%20State%20Capitol%20building.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 09:58:18.785080

Over the past three years, trillions of dollars have poured into sustainable investments—from renewable energy infrastructure to eco-conscious real estate. The numbers tell a compelling story of transformation that is reshaping industries, creating millions of jobs, and fundamentally altering how we invest.

The Investment Surge

For the first time in history, global energy investment exceeded $3 trillion in 2024. The International Energy Agency reports that $2 trillion of this went directly to sustainable investments in clean energy technologies and infrastructure—nearly double the $1.1 trillion invested in fossil fuels. This 2:1 ratio has widened from an approximate 1:1 ratio just a decade ago.

Solar photovoltaic investment alone is projected to exceed $500 billion in 2024, surpassing all other generation technologies combined. Meanwhile, global ESG fund assets—a key indicator of sustainable investments—reached $40.7 trillion in 2024, an 11% year-over-year increase. Green, social, and sustainability bond issuance hit a record $1.05 trillion, with green bonds accounting for 64% of the total.

As for the 2026 real estate market, this fits into the top trend for housing. You’ll find my recent essay on this of interest.

To put this growth in perspective: in 2015, the ratio of clean power to unabated fossil fuel power investments was roughly 2:1. By 2024, that ratio has soared to 10:1. Africa’s clean energy investments alone doubled between 2020 and 2024, reaching over $40 billion—a signal of massive infrastructure growth in emerging markets.

A Jobs Revolution

The surge in sustainable investments has translated directly into employment. According to IRENA, global renewable energy jobs reached 16.2 million in 2023, up from 13.7 million in 2022—an increase of nearly 2.5 million positions in a single year. The global energy sector added approximately 2.5 million jobs in 2023, with 1.5 million of those in clean energy sectors.

In the United States, clean energy jobs grew 3.9% in 2024—three times faster than the overall economy. Clean energy now accounts for 82% of all new energy jobs added in the country. From 2021 to 2024, U.S. clean energy employment increased by 12%, reaching 3.6 million workers, significantly outpacing the overall job market growth of 8%.

Solar PV remains the fastest-growing employer with 4.9 million jobs globally, while battery electric vehicle manufacturing jobs surged by 40% during this period. Clean energy employment has now surpassed fossil fuel employment globally—a historic crossover that occurred in 2021 and has only accelerated since.

Sustainable Homes: The New Premium

Sustainability, resilience, and efficiency have indeed become top real estate trends—and the data backs it up. Sustainable investments in the global green building market were valued at $565 billion in 2024 and are projected to reach $1.37 trillion by 2034, growing at a compound annual rate of 9.42%.

“84% of residents say living in a green home is important to them, and 64% would pay a premium to live in a green community.”— NAR 2024 Sustainability Report

The wellness real estate segment alone reached $584 billion in 2024, growing an extraordinary 20% annually over the past five years—nearly four times faster than overall global construction growth. The Global Wellness Institute projects this market will double to $1.1 trillion by 2029.

In 2024, over 355,000 homes were HERS (Home Energy Rating System) rated, a 13% increase from 2023. Nearly one-third of all new U.S. homes are now rated for energy efficiency—a direct result of sustainable investments in the housing sector. These homes save homeowners an average of $1,100 per year on energy costs compared to code-minimum construction.

New green buildings see an average 9% increase in asset value and a 10.5% reduction in first-year operating costs. Homes built to LEED standards show an 8% boost in resale value. With 72% of real estate professionals reporting that utility bills and operating costs are a top priority for clients, the market is responding decisively.

When I think of sustainable investments, I think of how we live in our home. It’s putting your money where your mouth is. You can find all sorts of sustainable investments you can make at home, right here.

The Path Forward

The data is unequivocal: capital is voting with its feet, and it’s walking firmly toward sustainability. With sustainable investments in clean energy now doubling fossil fuel spending, millions of new green jobs being created annually, and sustainable real estate commanding premium valuations, we are witnessing not a trend but a fundamental economic transformation.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/eap03.easyagentpro.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/877/2025/11/15141154/solar-power-7151958_1280.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 11:58:30.222379

As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential”

— Nick Ogilvie

CELINA, TX, UNITED STATES, January 2, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — As artificial turf continues its rapid expansion across residential, commercial, athletic, and municipal applications, industry leaders are increasingly focused on long-term performance, safety, and sustainability. One of the earliest and most influential figures shaping this shift is Nick Ogilvie, an artificial turf pioneer based in Celina, Texas, whose work spans more than two decades and nearly every major climate region in the United States.

Ogilvie is widely recognized within the industry for advancing artificial turf beyond surface-level installation and toward fully engineered systems designed for longevity, sanitation, and real-world performance. His career includes industry-first installations, nationally recognized certifications, proprietary product development, and extensive consulting work supporting artificial turf companies and facilities across the country.

National Experience Across Diverse Climates

Over the course of his career, Ogilvie has installed and consulted on artificial turf projects from Los Angeles, California, to Burlington, Vermont, and as far south as Sunset Key, Florida. His work spans arid desert conditions, coastal hurricane zones, cold-weather regions, and high-traffic commercial environments.

Industry professionals note that this geographic diversity has contributed to Ogilvie’s reputation as a system-level expert, with firsthand experience in how synthetic turf behaves under varying environmental, structural, and usage demands. In addition to his consulting work, Ogilvie has led installations through his company, Luxe Blades, assisting property owners, developers, and organizations with both new construction and remediation of underperforming turf systems.

Industry-First Installations and Certifications

Among Ogilvie’s most notable achievements is being the first to design and install an artificial turf Par 3 golf hole on the rim of Palo Duro Canyon, one of the most challenging natural landscapes in the United States. The project required advanced engineering solutions addressing wind exposure, drainage, and sub-base stability in a high-risk environment.

Ogilvie is also the only artificial turf installer to hold a certified wind uplift approval for rooftop turf installations under Miami-Dade Code, validated through independent testing and documentation by Haag Global. This certification is considered a benchmark for rooftop turf safety, particularly in hurricane-prone regions, and has helped establish artificial turf as a code-compliant architectural surface.

Product Innovation Driven by Field Experience

In addition to installation and consulting, Ogilvie has played a central role in developing products designed specifically for artificial turf systems—addressing gaps long recognized by industry professionals.

He developed Luxe Bond Pro, a proprietary turf adhesive engineered to withstand extreme heat, moisture, and shear forces commonly encountered in rooftop and high-stress turf installations. The adhesive was created in response to repeated failures observed with generic construction products not designed for synthetic turf applications.

Ogilvie also helped pioneer the first battery-powered artificial turf power broom, developed to restore turf fibers, rebalance infill, and improve surface drainage without damaging turf backing or seams. The innovation marked a shift away from improvised maintenance tools toward equipment engineered exclusively for artificial turf.

Advancing Eco-Conscious Turf Maintenance

Recognizing growing concerns around sanitation, pet safety, and environmental impact, Ogilvie contributed to the development of a fully natural cleaner and deodorizer designed specifically for artificial turf.

The product is:

Eco-friendly and pet-safe

Designed to eliminate odor-causing organic material at the source

Whole Foods EcoCompliant, making it the only artificial turf cleaner in the industry to meet that standard

The formulation also includes a natural, proprietary static-release technology, addressing static buildup commonly associated with synthetic turf surfaces—an issue long noted by facility managers and turf professionals.

Addressing the Industry’s Maintenance Gap

As artificial turf adoption accelerates nationwide, Ogilvie has consistently highlighted what many in the industry now acknowledge as a critical issue: turf systems are often installed correctly but lack proper long-term maintenance protocols.

Organic buildup, infill compaction, bacterial growth, and fiber fatigue can compromise turf performance, safety, and lifespan. Ogilvie’s work has focused on developing maintenance solutions that protect the integrity of turf systems while extending their usable life.

Industry observers note that his approach has helped shift the conversation from “maintenance-free” marketing claims toward realistic, performance-based stewardship of synthetic turf assets.

A Recognized Voice in a Maturing Industry

With artificial turf increasingly used in public spaces, sports facilities, rooftops, and pet environments, scrutiny around safety, compliance, and lifecycle cost continues to rise. Ogilvie’s experience—spanning installation, certification, product development, and maintenance—positions him as a recognized voice in the industry’s ongoing maturation.

Rather than focusing on short-term trends, his work emphasizes accountability, system integrity, and long-term value.

“Artificial turf has matured into permanent infrastructure, not a novelty surface,” said Nick Ogilvie. “As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential.”

“We clean the water,” said the superintendent of the Skowhegan Water Pollution Control Plant.

But as one of the oldest wastewater treatment plants in the state, Skowhegan’s facility, along with its sewer system, are constantly in need of improvement. So with the select board’s approval in August, a facility master plan study is now underway.

The planned plant improvements follow more than two decades and millions of dollars’ worth of investments in improving the town’s sewer system. The understanding of wastewater treatment and the biological processes that underpin it, meanwhile, continue to advance, Zaluski said.

And, Zaluski said, improving the plant goes hand-in-hand with ongoing efforts to revitalize the region’s economy and embrace Skowhegan’s connection to the Kennebec River.

“It’s a really good opportunity to optimize the plant and set it up for the next 20 years,” Zaluski said during a recent tour of the town’s plant, off Joyce Street.

Zaluski, 40, of Turner, was hired this spring as the water pollution control superintendent after longtime superintendent Brent Dickey retired. Before Skowhegan, Zaluski worked for the Portland Water District and did offshore work in Alaska.

Zaluski, though, is no stranger to the region: he grew up in the area and went to high school in Madison (and his mother is a recently retired employee of the Maine Trust for Local News and its predecessors).

“I’m excited to be here,” Zaluski said. “I want to acknowledge Brent for doing such a good job for 37 years. We have a precedent of really good environmentalism in this town. We can take that and keep that momentum going. We can do some really cool things for the community with an upgrade — things that bring budgets down.”

The plant at 53 Joyce St. takes sewage and stormwater from approximately 36 miles of collection system, treats it and discharges the cleaned water into the Kennebec River.

The facility, operated by four workers and staffed 365 days a year to meet state and federal permitting and data reporting requirements, is rated to take up to 1.65 million gallons a day.

The treatment process used in Skowhegan is fairly standard, Zaluski said. It largely uses aeration to feed bacteria, which naturally break down nutrients. The final step before water is put into the river is disinfection, done with sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as bleach.

Most of the municipal sewer system is downtown and in the surrounding neighborhoods, although parts of it extend outward, including underneath portions of Madison Avenue, North Avenue, Malbons Mills Road, Norridgewock Avenue, Waterville Road and Middle Road.

A 2019 study reported 5,000 people using the sewer system across 1,500 connections. The system is funded by town property taxes, rather than ratepayers like in a quasi-municipal district.

Skowhegan’s treatment plant dates back more than five decades. Newspaper archives show town voters approved funding in 1971. The plant was built mostly in 1972 and opened the next year.

Zaluski points out the Clean Water Act — the federal law regulating what can be discharged into bodies of water — was enacted in 1972, indicating Skowhegan’s leaders at the time were thinking ahead. The law prompted many communities across the country to build their wastewater treatment plants.

The last major upgrade of the treatment plant was in 2004, with smaller improvements done about 10 years later, according to records Zaluski compiled.

The town’s investment in the last 25 years has focused less on the plant, but more on reducing the impact of its combined sewer overflow.

Like in many older communities, especially those in the Northeast, Skowhegan’s system was designed to carry stormwater and wastewater in the same pipes.

Under normal conditions, all of it goes to the pollution control plant. But during heavy rainfall or snowmelt, the volume of water exceeds the system’s capacity, and and the system discharges untreated water.

Approximately 700 communities in the U.S. have combined sewer systems, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Efforts have been underway in those communities to separate the systems so that stormwater doesn’t flow into the plants, burden the systems, and cause untreated discharges.

As of 2024, Maine had 32 combined sewer overflow permittees in 29 communities, according to the most recent annual report from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Fifteen systems in Maine have fully completed their abatement plans, which the DEP began requiring in the early 1990s in response to federal requirements.

Mitigation work in Skowhegan has been done in phases funded by three bonds. The ultimate solution, Zaluski said, is separating stormwater and wastewater into different pipes throughout much of the system. But that essentially requires digging up every street.

The town has spent more than $20 million on the improvements. The work has resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in untreated discharges since the early 2000s, Zaluski said, although DEP data shows discharges vary widely by year.

For example, the system reported untreated discharges of approximately 253,000 gallons in 2021, 1.7 million gallons in 2022, 7.9 million gallons in 2023 and 2.4 million gallons in 2024, according to the DEP’s 2024 annual report. The number of discharge events has decreased steadily, with six reported in 2024.

With abatement work ongoing — the town has to file an updated master plan with the DEP every five years — Zaluski is now focusing on the plant itself.

The select board approved spending $42,500 for a facilities plan study; the town hired Olver Associates of Winterport to conduct it.

The six-month study is expected to continue into 2026. The goal is to go through every single asset and determine what to keep, what to get rid of, and what to improve. When complete, there will be proposals at a town meeting, when voters can decide if they want to proceed and what projects they want to fund.

Zaluski said improvements would likely include repairs to tanks and opportunities to use new biological technology, such as anoxic and anaerobic treatment zones in addition to the current aerobic treatment. Preventative maintenance is cheaper than major emergency repairs, he said.

He is also looking at ways to keep costs down. Aside from personnel, the department’s top cost in its roughly $1 million annual operating budget is disposal of sludge. The state has required sludge, which had been spread on farmland, to be taken to landfills because of the potentially harmful impacts of so-called forever chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

Zaluski said odor control measures could be considered as part of the ongoing facility study. In some cases, he said, the solution could be as simple and inexpensive as adding covers to tanks that are currently exposed. More advanced technology is available, too.

Some have pointed out that the plant’s location is less than ideal, just downstream of multimillion-dollar plans to build the long-discussed whitewater River Park, associated trail projects and riverfront improvements. Dealing with sewage comes with an odor.

“Odor control is tough because it’s sort of an elective,” Zaluski said. “It’s a public perception thing. It doesn’t improve the quality of your effluent, but it improves your public image.”

The planned improvements would also set the plant up to accommodate economic growth, Zaluski said.

He is working to develop an ordinance around an industrial pretreatment program, to put a formal framework in place for large, commercial users such as Gifford’s Ice Cream, as well as others that want to move to town.

“I’m looking at resilience in the capacity that we have,” Zaluski said. “It’s an economic driver. If a new business comes in here, we need to be able to handle it.”",https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/43324223_20251215__ms.skowheganwastewater.12xx-_0y071.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-03 09:57:56.327269

In 2025, BYD’s sales growth was particularly strong in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Europe, despite trade barriers and tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs.
The removal of these credits, along with efforts to roll back clean air regulations, sent a chill through the American EV market.","For years, Tesla was the undisputed leader in the electric vehicle (EV) market, its name practically synonymous with the future of clean transportation. But as the calendar flipped to 2026, a new champion emerged from the East: China’s BYD. The milestone, reported by outlets including BBC News, The Guardian, CNN, and The New York Times on January 2, 2026, marks the first time Tesla has been dethroned on a calendar-year basis. BYD’s rapid ascent is more than a symbolic victory—it signals a seismic shift in the global automotive industry, with implications that stretch from Wall Street to Main Street, and from Beijing to Detroit.

According to BBC News, BYD’s battery-powered car sales soared by almost 28% in 2025, reaching more than 2.25 million units. Tesla, meanwhile, saw its worldwide deliveries fall nearly 9% to 1.64 million vehicles, marking its second consecutive year of declining sales. The numbers are stark: BYD not only outsold Tesla, but did so by a margin of more than 600,000 vehicles. The Guardian put BYD’s battery electric car total at 2.26 million, while Tesla’s figure stood at 1.63 million.

How did this happen? The story is one of aggressive Chinese expansion, shifting government policies, and a touch of political drama. BYD, founded in 1995 by Wang Chuanfu as a battery company, has been quietly building its empire, first in China and then across the globe. In 2025, BYD’s sales growth was particularly strong in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Europe, despite trade barriers and tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs. The company’s UK sales, for example, surged by a staggering 880% in the year ending September 2025, driven by demand for its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV, as reported by BBC News.

It’s a remarkable turnaround for a company that, just over a decade ago, was dismissed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In a 2011 Bloomberg TV interview, Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD, saying, “I don’t think they have a great product.” Fast forward to 2025, and BYD has not only survived but thrived, outselling Tesla despite its EVs not being available for retail purchase in the United States, as noted by USA Today.

But BYD’s rise isn’t just about China’s manufacturing prowess. It’s also a tale of changing tides in government support. Tesla’s struggles in 2025 were exacerbated by the elimination of federal tax credits in the U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress scrapped up to $7,500 in subsidies for EV buyers, a move that hit Tesla particularly hard. As The New York Times reported, Tesla accounted for 45% of the U.S. EV market and had been the biggest beneficiary of federal incentives. The removal of these credits, along with efforts to roll back clean air regulations, sent a chill through the American EV market. Tesla’s car sales fell 16% in the last quarter of 2025 alone.

The political twists didn’t stop there. Musk himself became embroiled in controversy, having briefly served as head of the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump before stepping back. His increasingly visible political views, described by The Guardian as a “backlash from some consumers after Musk’s embrace of far-right politics,” may have also contributed to Tesla’s declining sales. Meanwhile, BYD kept its focus on product and expansion, even as it faced fierce competition at home, with Chinese rivals like Geely, MG, SAIC, and Chery all vying for market share.

Despite its sales slump, Tesla remains the world’s most valuable carmaker, with a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion—more than the next 30 automakers combined, according to The Guardian. Investors seem to be betting on Musk’s vision for the future, which now hinges less on selling cars and more on pioneering robotics and artificial intelligence. Tesla has invested heavily in its “Optimus” humanoid robot and self-driving “Robotaxis.” The company started limited robotaxi operations in Austin, Texas, in 2025, and its self-driving technology rollout in 2026 is seen as crucial to its future. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities told BBC News that Tesla could “own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope” of Tesla.

Yet, competition in autonomous driving is heating up. Several Chinese carmakers, including BYD, have introduced advanced driver-assistance systems, such as BYD’s “God’s Eye” technology, now standard even on its cheapest models. While Tesla’s stock price tumbled in early 2025 amid competition and controversy, it rebounded by year’s end, closing at a record $489.88 in December, as reported by CNBC. BYD’s shares also surged, jumping 5% after the latest sales figures were published, while Tesla’s dipped slightly.

Globally, EV sales rose about 28% in 2025, with Chinese automakers leveraging aggressive pricing to undercut Western rivals. BYD’s prices often come in below those of established brands, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. The company’s overall vehicle sales, including plug-in hybrids and commercial vehicles, reached 4.55 million in 2025. Its sales of plug-in hybrids fell 8% to 2.29 million, but commercial vehicle sales more than doubled to 57,000 units, according to The Guardian.

For Tesla, the loss of the global sales crown is a blow, but not necessarily a knockout. The company remains dominant in the U.S. and is betting big on technologies that could redefine transportation. But the landscape has changed. With governments in Europe and elsewhere rolling back aggressive EV targets, and consumers facing rising prices and fewer incentives, the path forward is less certain than it seemed just a few years ago.

As for BYD, the company’s ascent is a testament to the power of persistence, innovation, and strategic expansion. From its humble beginnings as a battery manufacturer in Shenzhen, BYD now stands atop the EV world—a position few would have predicted a decade ago. The question now is whether it can maintain its lead as the race for the future of mobility enters a new and unpredictable phase.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/jTOQ6HZFGe-rCOpj6NhbaiMJZTM=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F5d0e0773-8954-4c92-a660-0f8932903179.jpeg,N,,2026-01-03 17:58:46.352288

Lake Area Technical College, which has two degree-providing programs in the energy sector, has seen students with renewed interest in the industry thanks to both its growth and opportunity in the state.

Brooks Jacobsen, energy department supervisor at Lake Area Tech, told News Watch that the school's energy operations and energy technology programs have 100% job placement rates. According to Lake Area Tech's website, the energy technology program has an average salary of $71,000 after six months of employment.

Jacobsen said that the exposure students get to various energy sectors, including hydroelectricity, coal, wind and solar energy, allow them to be more flexible when searching for the right career.

""They'll go do an interview or a job shadow on (a specific energy sector) and they'll just love it, and they never thought they would. We try to keep an open mind, try to pre-teach these students that there are these capabilities all over the state,"" Jacobsen said.

News Watch spoke to three students about their decision to enter the energy sector and the opportunities that the state provides for their futures. Here are their stories.

Lakshan Sethuhewa, a 29-year-old student from Sri Lanka, came to Lake Area Tech after a tour that showed him the ""sophisticated program."" Now in his second year, Sethuhewa said he already has a job as a refrigeration expert lined up at the soon-to-open CJ Schwan’s Foods production facility in Sioux Falls.

He said that all of his classmates have job prospects, and that choosing energy was in part due to the vast employment opportunities the field offers.

Sethuhewa is a student in the energy operations program, which trains students to manage energy facilities and operate plants. He described the program as ""hands-on and minds-on,"" and appreciated how his education could translate globally.

""You can practice energy everywhere in the world. Whether you want to go to Europe, South Asia, energy is everywhere,"" Sethuhewa said.

For Quincy Thu, energy runs in the family: his father began teaching energy technology at Lake Area Tech in 2022, which got Thu thinking about the opportunities of the sector.

Thu said that the proximity of the school to his home in Castlewood, as well as affordability, was his deciding factor. As he comes into his final year in the program, he said that he's particularly interested in the wind energy sector, which has strong roots in the eastern side of the state.

""I'm trying to talk to people, interview people, find out where I want to go, find the best company that fits me,"" Thu said.

But he plans on staying in the state for any future career ventures.

""I'm from South Dakota, I love it here,"" Thu said.

Tate Sheehan, a second-year student who is originally from Bird Island, Minnesota, said that his decision to enter the energy sector comes from the idea that the industry's growth is not slowing down any time soon.

He said that a combination of in-class work and hands-on projects has allowed him to feel exceptionally prepared for his entry into the energy world.

Though he's a few hundred miles from home, Sheehan said he plans to stay in South Dakota and find a company he can ""settle down"" with while continuing to climb the career ladder – a goal he credits to seeing firsthand how quickly the industry is growing.

“As part of that case, Empire plans to seek a preliminary injunction and allow construction to continue while the litigation proceeds,” ‌Equinor added.

Last week, the Trump administration ‌suspended leases for five large offshore wind projects that are under construction off the U.S. East Coast over what it called national security concerns, sending shares of offshore ​wind companies plunging.

Renewable energy - considered crucial to limiting climate change - produced a record amount of electricity in Great Britain in 2025, BBC analysis shows.

Wind was the biggest single renewable source of electricity, according to the provisional figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso).

But solar-powered electricity rose by nearly a third on 2024 levels, helped by the UK's sunniest year on record and the expansion of solar panels around the country.

While behind renewables, electricity from fossil gas also rose slightly, highlighting the challenge of reaching the government's ""clean power"" target by 2030.

""It has been quite a strong year in terms of deployment of renewables,"" said Pranav Menon, research senior associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.

""[But] what we're not seeing is kind of the exponential scale-up that you'd need to get to clean power 2030, because those targets are very, very ambitious,"" he added.

Under its ""clean power"" target, the government aims to use hardly any polluting gas to produce electricity by 2030. It is also under pressure to meet its pledge to bring energy bills down by up to £300 by then and has argued that clean power can achieve this.

Neso data - and the clean power target - only cover Great Britain and not Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator.

The recent growth of renewables has been one of the strongest areas of progress in the world's attempts to tackle climate change.

The trend has been notable in Great Britain over the past decade too. The government wants to ramp up renewables even more quickly to help meet its own clean power goal and reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions.

In 2025, wind, solar, hydro and biomass generated more than 127 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in Great Britain, according to BBC analysis of provisional Neso data.

That beats the previous high of 119TWh in 2024.

Wind generated more than 85TWh - nearly 30% - of Great Britain's electricity last year, up slightly on 2024, according to analysis of Neso data.

But the most notable change was solar power.

Over the course of the year, solar panels generated more than 18TWh - over 6% of British electricity.

While that is still a relatively small share, it marks a growth of more than 4TWh versus 2024.

At its peak, solar was producing more than 40% of electricity for a small number of half-hour periods in July.

Back in 2013, no such period had more than roughly 5% of electricity generation from solar.

Part of the reason is the expansion of solar panels across the UK. More large solar farms came online this year, including the biggest at Cleve Hill near Faversham, in Kent.

And it was a record year for solar panels on rooftops, with about 250,000 new small-scale installations reported to the Microgeneration Certification Scheme.

With 2025 the UK's sunniest year on record, conditions were ideal for British solar panels to capitalise on long, sunny days through the spring and summer.

""Solar's probably a bigger part of the system than we'd expected, given the cost has come down so much,"" said Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London.

Renewables can generate significant amounts of electricity when conditions are right. On roughly a third of days in 2025, at least half of Britain's electricity came from renewables, according to BBC analysis of Neso data.

But the British electricity grid often still leans heavily on fossil fuel gas.

Analysis of Neso's figures shows gas generated more than 77TWh - roughly 27% - of electricity, up from 72TWh in 2024.

That increase could be down to several factors, including Britain importing slightly less electricity from Europe, lower nuclear generation, the closure of the last coal power station in 2024 and higher electricity demand.

Driven by the rise in gas, Britain's electricity was slightly more polluting in 2025 than 2024, according to Neso's data.

In 2025, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 126g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - up from 124g/kWh in 2024 but down from 505g/kWh in 2012.

With the exception of wind and solar, Neso's figures only cover generation connected to the main transmission network.

They do not include smaller-scale gas, biomass and hydro operators feeding in electricity at a local level, but these contribute a relatively small fraction of Britain's total generation.

Separate analysis of UK government data by the climate website Carbon Brief - which includes these smaller sources and Northern Ireland - shows very similar trends to the Neso data for Great Britain. That includes a new renewables record and a slight rise in gas generation.

Off track for clean power?

The government has defined its ""clean power"" target as 95% of all electricity generated in Britain coming from renewables and nuclear energy by 2030.

In 2024 clean sources produced almost three-quarters of total electricity generation for the year, according to government figures.

These numbers differ from Neso data, which includes imports as well as some gas generation not covered by the government's clean power definition.

Government figures for 2025 will not be released until later this year - but the amount of gas still in the electricity mix shows there is much to be done.

""There's still a significant number of periods in the year where the sun's not shining, the wind's not blowing, demand is high […] and that's where the system is sort of forced to rely on gas-fired power to turn up and meet demand,"" said Mr Menon.

He added that there were solutions to this challenge. They include technologies like batteries - to store renewable electricity to use when it is less sunny and windy - as well as other low-carbon sources like nuclear, which can provide dependable output.

One of the other struggles in meeting the clean power target is the need to upgrade the electricity grid, partly to connect new renewables and move their electricity around the country.

Sometimes the grid cannot cope with all of the renewable electricity that could be generated, leading to wind farms being paid to reduce their output.

Grid upgrades should help to reduce the problem but upgrades add to costs in the short term.

That could offset some of the savings from some of the cheapest renewables which are starting to displace gas power, according to Prof Grubb.

But he said he still expected bills to start to come down in the coming years - partly due to those renewables, but also assuming gas prices fall from their recent high levels.

In response to the renewables data, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""After years of delay and underinvestment, this government is keeping its promise to take back control of Britain's energy with clean homegrown power.""

This would ""protect households against volatile fossil fuel markets"", he added.

But shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho called on the government to ditch its clean power target, arguing it was raising energy bills.

""Britain is generating more renewable power than ever before, but people should know about the extra costs that come along with it,"" she said.

CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Sixteen-year-old Arthur Brodard went to the Le Constellation bar with friends to celebrate the New Year. Nearly 48 hours after a devastating fire, his mother still held out hope he might be one of the six injured people who remained unidentified after one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.

Those half-dozen people gave a glimmer of hope for families whose loved ones were missing in the aftermath of the fire at the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana that killed 40 people and injured 119 others, 113 of whom have been formally identified.

“I’m looking everywhere. The body of my son is somewhere,” Laetitia Brodard, from Lausanne, Switzerland, told reporters. “I want to know, where is my child, and be by his side. Wherever that may be, be it in the intensive care unit or the morgue.”

The severity of the burns has made it difficult to identify both the injured and deceased, requiring families to supply authorities with DNA samples. In some cases, wallets and any identification documents inside turned to ash in the flames. An Instagram account has filled up with photos of people who were unaccounted for, and friends and relatives begged for tips about their whereabouts.

Officials in the Valais regional government acknowledged the prolonged heartache.

How one Swiss hospital coped with the injured from the Alpine bar fire

SION, Switzerland (AP) — The hospital that initially took in the majority of injured victims from a fire at a Swiss bar is no stranger to emergencies: In the heart of the Alps, it is used to treating winter sports enthusiasts who have accidents on the slopes.

But the flood of young and severely burned survivors from the blaze that tore through Le Constellation in Crans-Montana during New Year's Eve revelry was something else.

Eric Bonvin, general director of the regional hospital in Sion that took in several dozen injured people, said those with severe burns face months of treatment but expressed hope that their youth will speed their recovery.

The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital, which is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the resort by air. Survivors have described seeing their fellow revelers struggling to escape the inferno, some with severe burns.

Bonvin recounted how hospital staff scrambled to determine the extent of people’s injuries — aided by colleagues who had not been scheduled to work but rushed in to lend a hand.

Zelenskyy names Ukraine's head of military intelligence as his new chief of staff

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday appointed the head of Ukraine's military intelligence as his new chief of staff, a move that comes as the U.S. leads a diplomatic push to end Russia's nearly 4-year-old invasion.

Announcing the appointment of Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needs to focus on security issues, developing its defense and security forces, and peace talks — areas that are overseen by the office of the president.

Zelenskyy had dismissed his previous chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, after anti-corruption officials began investigating alleged graft in the energy sector.

The president framed Budanov's appointment as part of a broader effort to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy.

“Kyrylo has specialized experience in these areas and sufficient strength to achieve results,” Zelenskyy said.

Trump and top Iranian officials exchange threats over protests roiling Iran

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as widening protests swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June.

At least eight people have been killed so far in violence surrounding the demonstrations, which were sparked in part by the collapse of Iran’s rial currency but have increasingly seen crowds chanting anti-government slogans.

The protests, now in their sixth day, have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the protests have yet to be as widespread and intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.

Trump initially wrote on his Truth Social platform, warning Iran that if it “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.”

“We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” Trump wrote, without elaborating.

Yemen’s separatists announce a constitution for an independent south

ADEN, Yemen (AP) — Yemen 's separatist movement on Friday announced a constitution for an independent nation in the south and demanded other factions in the war-torn country accept the move in an escalation of a confrontation that has pitted Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against each other.

The UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council depicted the announcement as a declaration of independence for the south. But it was not immediately clear if the move could be implemented or was largely symbolic. Last month, STC-linked fighters seized control of two southern provinces from Saudi-backed forces and took over the Presidential Palace in the south's main city, Aden. Members of the internationally recognized government — which had been based in Aden — fled to the Saudi-capital Riyadh.

On Friday, Saudi warplanes bombed camps and military positions held by the STC in Hadramout province as Saudi-backed fighters tried to seize the facilities, a separatist official said. It was the latest direct intervention by Saudi Arabia, which in recent weeks has bombed STC forces and struck what is said was a shipment of Emirati weapons destined for the separatists.

Meanwhile, the UAE announced early Saturday it had completely withdrawn all its troops from Yemen, something it pledged to do after the confrontation.

Ostensibly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and their allies on the ground in Yemen have all been part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who control the north in the country's decade-long civil war. The coalition's professed goal has long been to restore the internationally recognized government, which was driven out of the north by the Houthis. But tensions between the factions and the two Gulf nations appear to be unraveling the coalition, threatening to throw them into outright conflict and further tear apart the Arab world's poorest country.

Trump wants to overhaul the 'president's golf course.' He hasn't played there yet

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has spent much of his two-week vacation in Florida golfing. But when he gets back to the White House, there's a military golf course that he's never played that he's eyeing for a major construction project.

Long a favored getaway for presidents seeking a few hours’ solace from the stress of running the free world, the Courses at Andrews — inside the secure confines of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the White House — are known as the “president's golf course."" Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Joe Biden have spent time there, and Barack Obama played it more frequently than any president, roughly 110 times in eight years.

Trump has always preferred the golf courses his family owns — spending about one of every four days of his second term at one of them. But he's now enlisted golf champion Jack Nicklaus as the architect to overhaul the Courses at Andrews.

“It’s amazing that an individual has time to take a couple hours away from the world crises. And they’re people like everybody else,” said Michael Thomas, the former general manager of the course, who has golfed with many of the presidents visiting Andrews over the years.

Andrews, better known as the home of Air Force One, has two 18-hole courses and a 9-hole one. Its facilities have undergone renovations in the past, including in 2018, when Congress approved funding to replace aging presidential aircraft and to build a new hangar and support facilities. That project was close enough to the courses that they had to be altered then, too.

FBI says it disrupted a New Year's Eve attack plan inspired by Islamic State group

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The FBI said Friday it disrupted a New Year’s Eve attack plot targeting a grocery store and fast-food restaurant in North Carolina, arresting an 18-year-old man who authorities say pledged loyalty to the Islamic State group.

Christian Sturdivant was charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Investigators said he told an undercover FBI employee posing as a supportive confidant about his plans to attack people. Their online messages, along with a recent search of his home, indicated attacks would occur with knives and hammers, according to prosecutors and records.

Worried Sturdivant might attempt violence before New Year’s Eve, the FBI placed him under constant surveillance for days, including on Christmas, U.S. Attorney for Western North Carolina Russ Ferguson said.

Agents were prepared to arrest him earlier if he left his home with weapons, Ferguson said at a news conference in Charlotte. “At no point was the public in harm’s way.”

Sturdivant was arrested Wednesday and remained in custody after a federal court appearance Friday. An attorney representing him did not immediately respond to an email or phone message seeking comment. Another hearing was scheduled for Jan. 7.

Grandmother and grandson burn to death in Gaza tent while cooking; Jolie visits Rafah crossing

DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson burned to death in Gaza when their tent caught fire while cooking, as thousands of Palestinians endure colder weather in makeshift housing.

The nylon tent in Yarmouk caught fire Thursday night while a meal was being prepared, a neighbor said. A hospital official said that two Palestinian men were killed by Israeli gunfire on Friday in Gaza.

The shaky 12-week-old ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas militant group has largely ended large-scale Israeli bombardment of Gaza. But Palestinians are still being killed by Israeli forces, especially along the so-called Yellow Line that delineates areas under Israeli control.

On Friday, American actor and film producer Angelina Jolie visited the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

Over the past few weeks, cold winter rains have repeatedly lashed the sprawling tent cities, causing flooding, turning Gaza’s dirt roads into mud and causing damaged buildings to collapse.

Tesla loses title as world's biggest electric vehicle maker as sales fall for second year in a row

NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It's a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world's richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump's marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Earthquake with 6.5 magnitude rattles southern and central Mexico killing 2

MEXICO CITY (AP) — A strong earthquake rattled southern and central Mexico on Friday, interrupting President Claudia Sheinbaum ’s first press briefing of the new year as seismic alarms sounded and leaving at least two people dead.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5 and its epicenter was near the town of San Marcos in the southern state of Guerrero near the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, according to Mexico ’s national seismological agency. There were more than 500 aftershocks.

The state’s civil defense agency reported various landslides around Acapulco and on other highways in the state.

Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said that a 50-year-old woman living in a small community near the epicenter died when her home collapsed. Authorities also said that a hospital in Chilpancingo, Guerrero's capital, suffered major structural damage and various patients were evacuated.

In 2026, the pressure will be even higher as AI data centers driven by Microsoft and Amazon come online. And it seems everyone, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, has big ideas for the future.

The governor’s Lightning Plan and a competing push for both fossil fuel and renewable projects drove debate over a host of issues, all circling the same question of whether new generation can be added to the grid fast enough.

Billed as an “all of the above” energy strategy designed to lower consumer costs, create energy jobs, and streamline approval of new power projects in the commonwealth, it has met opposition on several fronts.

The plan – House Bill 501 – requires 35% of generation to come from renewable sources within 10 years. It advanced from the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee in June by a 14-12 party-line vote, with no Republicans in support. In October, it was removed from the table, with no further action to date.

It also seeks to create the Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition (RESET) board, intended to expedite the approval of major energy projects. However, some opponents claimed that it would undermine municipal zoning and local control. In April, it was referred to the House Energy Committee, where it awaits further action.

Industry experts say clean energy projects can be built quickly and affordably, though getting the proposals through the legislative process may take time.

Lawmakers wanting to make solar a part of the state’s broader energy strategy say last year’s budget impasse stalled momentum and now hope the bills will rise on the priority list.

The Solar for Schools Grant Program is one exception: the legislation creating it passed last session with bipartisan support and backing from environmental and labor groups. In the pilot round, demand outpaced funding. The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development received 88 applications from schools across 25 counties requesting $88 million – more than three times the available $25 million. The administration added another $25 million to the budget in 2025-2026 to expand the program.

A bill to conduct a study on the viability of renewable energy projects on Lake Erie has been lying dormant since May.

During a House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee meeting on the subject, supporters emphasized that the study explores the opportunity to diversify Pennsylvania’s energy portfolio while prioritizing the use of clean, renewable energy without increasing utility prices. Opponents expressed concerns over the impact on wildlife, outdoor recreation, shipping, and tourism.

House Bill 1155, a Democratic-backed community solar proposal, would let people who can’t install panels at home, such as renters, subscribe to a shared solar project to lower their electricity bills while strengthening the grid. It’s also designed so non-subscribers aren’t responsible for costs associated with the program.

Legislation in both chambers takes advantage of the proliferation of warehouses that have popped up in the commonwealth by making use of their rooftops to deploy solar.

House Bill 1260 proposed requiring new warehouses to be built “solar-ready” while offering tax incentives to retrofit existing structures. In parallel, Senate Bill 983 would create a commercial and industrial rooftop solar program designed to streamline front-of-meter projects – installations that can send power back into the grid.

Supporters argued that rooftop solar avoids new land use fights and can scale quickly compared with large greenfield developments. Skeptics warned mandates risk government overreach and suggested incentives-only approaches would be more politically viable.

Federal money is also on the table to help low-to-moderate income households install solar through the Solar for All program, but Pennsylvania law requires legislative approval before it can be accessed.

House Bill 362 was introduced to clear the way for the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority to tap into the $156 million the EPA awarded in 2024 through the Inflation Reduction Act. The program promises at least 20% savings on electricity bills while also supporting workforce training and upgrades needed to make solar possible.

The tax credits for wind and solar being phased out by the congressional budget resolution passed in July was widely viewed as a blow to the renewable energy industry but clean energy advocates remain optimistic.

Even as electricity costs are projected to rise over the next decade, they say, some wind and solar developments can still qualify for credits if construction begins within a year of the law’s passage. And federal incentives remain available for other technologies such as geothermal and battery energy storage – an especially important opening for Pennsylvania as power demand climbs alongside major tech-sector investment.

Still, others warned that repealing bipartisan federal tax credits for energy manufacturing could jeopardize $1.34 billion in potential investment. Reduced investment and rising energy costs, they say, would lead to 26,000 fewer jobs by 2030 and nearly 29,000 fewer by 2035 compared to projections under current tax policy.

They pointed to a report projecting that the elimination of energy-related tax credits would reduce new clean power additions to the grid by 57% to 72%, even as the state’s energy demand is expected to rise by 4.5 to 6.5 TWh by 2026. Additionally, without technology-neutral federal incentives, electricity prices could jump 8% over the same period.

Technology companies responsible for power-hungry data centers have hitched their hopes on a resurgence of nuclear power. Amazon and Microsoft have both enlisted existing plants to fuel their AI infrastructure, while the industry looks toward the development of small modular reactors for future output.

The reaction to the reopening of Three Mile Island through a purchase agreement with Microsoft remains split. Supporters emphasize jobs and carbon-free baseload power while opponents focus on waste, risk, and site concerns.

As renewables and nuclear advanced in committees, advocates made the argument for the reliability of natural gas and touted pipeline expansion as a key to U.S. energy dominance.

At Shale Insight 2025, hosted by the Marcellus Shale Coalition in Erie, the message from industry leaders and policymakers was consistent: natural gas remains the backbone of America’s energy system. Expanding pipeline capacity, modernizing regulations, and protecting affordability were framed as essential to meeting rising demand in a rapidly changing landscape.

At the conference, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum warned against policies that shut down base loads like gas and nuclear plants while prioritizing highly subsidized, intermittent, and unreliable renewable sources of electricity – arguing such policies have led to higher costs and less reliability.

Participants widely agreed natural gas is the cornerstone of U.S. energy, while highlighting overlapping concerns over grid reliability, affordability, and infrastructure bottlenecks.

Marcellus Shale was also mentioned in a study by the National Energy Technology Laboratory suggesting wastewater from the region could supply 40% of U.S. lithium needs – an exciting prospect as lithium demand surges for phones, EVs, and grid-scale storage. This, however, presents a dilemma for clean energy advocates, as it comes from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking – an industry they oppose.

Throughout the year, affordability and reliability framed every discussion. As 2026 begins, the question isn’t whether Pennsylvania needs more power – it’s about who will decide what gets built – and how fast.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/67/967975d9-9364-4f19-b18d-5a4c28696b0c/68d80fae15cf8.image.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 05:57:18.823798

Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.","Tesla lost its crown as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk's right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It's a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla's rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world's richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don't matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company's energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla's directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world's first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.",https://krcgtv.com/resources/media2/16x9/3000/1320/0x131/90/2284ff11-67f2-48b5-8ab7-e49fe3644963-AP26002455610143.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 12:58:23.111711

Over time, silt filled the river bottom from increased runoff, and large ships could no longer navigate through the waters.
The Anacostia River watershed, the area that drains into the main branch of the river, covers 176 square miles of highly urbanized geography.
The budget crisis has resulted in the termination of funding that supported the free educational Anacostia Riverkeeper boat tours.
For organizations that rely on government grants, like Anacostia Riverkeeper, this can be a devastating blow to operations.","“It’s such a different sight than what people expect of the Anacostia River,” says Trey Sherard.

The riverkeeper slowly pulls his boat up to the underpass of the Anacostia Railroad Bridge, collapses the boat canopy, and wryly asks if anyone has read The Chronicles of Narnia. Sherard is met with a few yeses and some nos, then says we are about to enter the Anacostia River version of the wardrobe that transports to a magical land.

Before us are sunbathing turtles, an osprey nest, and two miles of undeveloped waterfront. The Anacostia River—known to many in Washington, D.C., as a littered and polluted urban waterway —seemingly has a natural beauty to rival rivers anywhere in the United States. Lush green woodlands slope into muddy riverbanks. Wetland grasses sway in the breeze, and the sun glistens off the current.

“This section of river here,” says Sherard, “is what we call the epicenter of environmental racism on this river, which is saying a lot because the whole river has often been defined in terms of environmental injustice.”

Along the river’s east bank are five historically Black Washington communities: Mayfair, River Terrace, Kenilworth, Parkside, and Eastland Gardens, all boxed in between the river, Kenilworth Park, and the Anacostia Freeway. For decades, these communities have dealt with disinvestment, industrial pollution, and the waste and litter carried by the neglected river. Swimming in the Anacostia was deemed unsafe and made illegal in 1971. The communities surrounding the river have been vocal about these problems since the area was first developed.

“It’s not for lack of advocacy by the community, [that the river was neglected],” says Sherard, “but for lack of their message being received by someone held accountable.”

At this point in the tour, the boat is located squarely inside D.C., but from the bow, it looks like you’re out in the country. The juxtaposition of the rich greenery from the U.S. National Arboretum and Kenilworth Park with the history of environmental racism of the area is staggering. Sherard, who leads this boat tour as part of his work with the organization Anacostia Riverkeeper, says that the contrast is useful for helping people understand what’s happened here and getting them engaged.

“[The river is] this incredible asset and opportunity, even despite all of the abuse that we’ve given to it,” he says.

The eight-and-a-half mile Anacostia River is short, but has a long history of supporting human life. The largest of three D.C.-area Native American villages, Nacotchtank, was located along the river, which was called anaquash, meaning “village trading center.” Historians believe Native Americans lived on the river for 10,000 years before being pushed out by European colonialization. Settlers arriving in the early seventeenth century found a river teeming with shad, herring, and perch, and in places it was forty feet deep, leaving plenty of room for large vessels to navigate the waterway.

The District’s population boomed during and after the Civil War as newly freed enslaved people moved north and Union soldiers garrisoned there. Over time, silt filled the river bottom from increased runoff, and large ships could no longer navigate through the waters. Its usefulness as a waterway for shipping ended, and many industries treated the river as a waste disposal site.

Sewage has proven to be a perennial problem for the Anacostia River. A significant portion of the capital’s sewer system was built before 1900 and is a combined sewer system, which means stormwater and sewage are mixed. This doesn’t cause problems when conditions are stable, but during heavy rainfalls, the system can overflow into nearby waterways, including the Anacostia. These events can cause bacteria levels to spike to unhealthy amounts, giving rise to waterborne illness. As humans continue to drive climate change by rapidly burning fossil fuels, D.C. is seeing more intense rainstorms. The Anacostia River watershed, the area that drains into the main branch of the river, covers 176 square miles of highly urbanized geography. Stormwater, sewage, sediment, and trash all flow into the river, creating a concentrated mix of harmful debris.

“You can associate the conditions and health of the river to conditions and health of the areas that border it, and that includes the people who inhabit those areas,” says Dennis Chestnut, a lifelong Washingtonian and resident of Ward 7. “When discussing environmental justice on the Anacostia River, you have to include and focus as much on the communities that border the river.”

Chestnut is a master carpenter and vocational educator by profession, and is also a national river hero and environmental activist with a palpable enthusiasm. “The river really got me very interested in science and made me appreciate the outdoors,” he says. His relationship to the river is lifelong, and he has made it a personal goal to help others build one as well.

“As a child, it was like an ocean to me,” Chestnut says. In the 1950s and 1960s—before it was outlawed—he learned to swim in the Anacostia and in a tributary near his childhood home. Today that tributary, a stream called Watts Branch, is mostly captured in concrete channels and culverts. For Chestnut and his family, it was like a personal beach, and since it was an inlet, it was safer to swim.

“The times that we were in, the reason we were swimming in the stream and in the river was because Washington, D.C., was legally segregated,” says Chestnut. “The closest swimming pool was in a white community and it was segregated. We couldn’t go to that pool. But we had the river.”

Chestnut emphasizes that the environmental burdens on the Anacostia River and the communities to its east have not been accidental. He points out that railroad tracks crisscross Ward 7, highway 295 cuts through the middle of the community, and the riverside Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) plant burned coal and dumped waste in the river for decades, alongside many other polluting industries.

Watts Branch flows through Kenilworth Park, which was Kenilworth Dump and Landfill for nearly three decades. The site received municipal waste from the capital, burned trash openly, and received ashes from nearby incinerators, which leached into the river. The dump exposed the nearby community and river to smoke and toxic chemicals. It was one of the few open areas in the communities east of the river, and Chestnut remembers playing at the dump with his friends. In 1968, seven-year-old Kelvin Tyrone Mock burned to death while playing on the trash when winds shifted and engulfed the child in flames. The following day, the mayor ordered open-burning at the dump to stop, but municipal trash continued to fill the site until 1970.

“All of those things that we would consider negative impact kinds of things—like the railroad tracks, the freeway, the power plant, the landfill—were located on this side of the city primarily because this was the side where the people of color and poor people lived,” says Chestnut. “This community has been resilient for a long time, having to put up with all of those things.”

Earth Conservation Corps (ECC) a youth-driven environmental action organization that works to restore the Anacostia River, has also made enormous strides in helping communities reclaim the river through cleanups and youth programs, but there is much more to be done.

“The perception of the Anacostia [to most in Generation Z] right now is still, ‘Nah, it’s dirty, don’t touch it,’ ” says Sonora Phillips, director of programs and partnerships at ECC.

Yet, she adds, “Young people are powerful. Getting young people involved in the environment and allowing them to see they can make a difference . . . that’s huge.”

Phillips helps students care for raptors; maintain Turtle Beach, one of the last few remaining wetlands along the Anacostia River; and learn about the power of storytelling and environmental education through ECC’s Youth Media Arts program.

The ECC program works with youth from many different backgrounds, including students coming from the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services.

“These are youth who are often counted out, and [now] they’re doing conservation work,” Phillips says. “It’s amazing; I never thought the environment would be the thing that would take young people out of their current [difficult] environment, and it is.”

Washington, D.C., has been in a budget crisis for the better part of 2025. The problems started in March when the House of Representatives passed a federal government funding bill that would force the D.C. Council to revert to its 2024 budget parameters. This move left a $1.1 billion gap in a previously balanced budget midway through the financial year. Months later, a fix for the budget has stalled out at the hands of ultraconservatives, with their insistence on more limits on voting rights and abortion. While city officials have added some money back to the budget, many cuts have been made to plug the enormous hole.

The budget crisis has resulted in the termination of funding that supported the free educational Anacostia Riverkeeper boat tours. There are also now no funds for the organization to monitor water quality, or to maintain trash traps that capture floating debris in the water.

“We’re coming to an inflection point now,” says Sherard. “We need to keep moving forward and not risk losing ground as we lose investment.”

Under the Trump Administration, the nonprofit landscape has entered uncharted waters with organizations facing the possibility of losing government funding or their tax-exempt status if they are at odds with the White House. For organizations that rely on government grants, like Anacostia Riverkeeper, this can be a devastating blow to operations. Sherard says the administration is relentlessly attacking environmental initiatives and organizations.

“Philanthropy largely backed out of this watershed a little while back after it got it from ‘worst’ to ‘OK,’ ” says Sherard. Anacostia Riverkeeper has seen a small uptick in philanthropic donations, but not enough to cover foundational needs. “We hope that big philanthropy will step in while clearly the government is unable to do so, but we don’t know, and that uncertainty is a big stressor.”

“The river is this beautiful green and blue way through the middle of Northeast and Southeast D.C.,” he adds. “Someone who hasn’t seen it firsthand can’t really truly understand that.”

While political shifts have disrupted Anacostia Riverkeeper, momentum continues forward through new and old partnerships, with a swim event still set as a long-term goal. Since the swimming ban in 1971, the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment amended the rules in 2018 to permit single-day swim events if certain healthy conditions are met. There is no date on the calendar for a 2025 swim event, as the permitting process can take months, but Anacostia Riverkeeper is hoping to host an event in 2026.

Chestnut is excited by the prospect.

“I still have the same attachment to the river as I had as a child, and I hope to be able to swim in it again,” he says with a big smile. “This community, full of natural resources, has done a lot for me and I just feel so very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be here and still be here.”

Despite the recent financial setbacks and a grim political landscape, Chestnut is heartened by the efforts of his community in Ward 7 to restore the river.

“I feel good about where I see things,” Chestnut says. “If we keep going in this direction, and get future generations involved, it’s going to be the kind of river we should have in the nation’s capital.”

With global EV sales rising 28% last year, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe, where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival.

The annual deliveries figure raises questions about whether Tesla can stabilize its core auto business following two consecutive years of sales declines, even as it pivots to futuristic projects such as robotics and self-driving cars to justify its steep valuation.

Tesla shares were marginally up in early trading.

""I think the market remains focused on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin,"" said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

""If deliveries can continue to not be down too much in the coming quarters, I expect market sentiment around the robotaxi will continue to drive the stock,"" Goldstein added.

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in U.S. EV tax credits before they expired at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off.

EV demand has softened in the U.S. since the end of September, when President Donald Trump's administration ended $7,500 federal tax credits.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down 15.6% from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3% drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company's second consecutive annual decline.

Analysts have said Tesla came under immense pressure in 2025 in North America and Europe, where competition intensified and the company faced brand backlash due to CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric.

Growing competition from Chinese firms and European automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW has weighed on Tesla's sales momentum.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150% from 2024. The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors, who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

Coal has long powered the homes and industries of Indiana, but the future of the state’s energy landscape is at a crossroads. As the push for renewable energy grows stronger, the state faces tough questions about how to transition away from its reliance on coal – an energy source deeply embedded in both the economy and culture. What will it take to make that shift, and why has it taken so long? WFHB Environmental Correspondent Amelia Bucher explores the challenges, the stakes, and the politics of Indiana’s energy future in her feature on the path to cleaner, more sustainable power.

Up next, on June 9th, 2025, the city of Bloomington posted a news release that explained an insect, named the Spotted Lanternfly, had been confirmed in Bartholomew County, about 50 miles from Bloomington. The insect, a non-native and invasive species, can feed on more than 70 plants, harming growth and health of plants. Correspondent Katrine Bruner spoke with the city’s Urban Forester, Haskell Smith, to learn more about the insect and what Bloomington has been doing to mitigate risk.

“Agency Defendants have not ‘reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the[ir] decision’ to implement the Wind Order,” U.S. District Judge Patti Saris said. “Indeed, the Agency Defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the President’s direction to do so.”

Section 112 enables the president to exempt any stationary source of air pollution from any CAA regulation for two years if he or she “determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available” and that it is in the U.S. national security interest to do so.

The Transformer Shortage Is Systemic, Not Isolated While transformers draw the most attention, the transformer shortage is really a transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment shortage.","Analysts still see multi-year deficits in U.S. transformer supply, even as equipment manufacturers invest billions in new factories and advanced manufacturing processes. But some brokers suggest there is no real shortage and that, if there is a crisis, it stems from procurement blinders.

The electrical transformer “shortage” seems to have become the defining supply chain story of the 2020s, and it has factored into utility capital plans, renewable deployment timelines, and even how grid resilience is discussed at the policy level. As POWER reported in 2024, over the past few years, what started as a squeeze has gradually morphed into a crisis, furnished by years of underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, a sudden surge in post-pandemic construction and electrification, and volatility in grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) and copper markets, which steadily pushed lead times for large power and generator step-up (GSU) transformers beyond historical norms.

At POWER’s Experience POWER conference in October 2025, concerns remained centered on procurement of the critical components, which are used to step voltage up for transmission, step it back down for safe distribution, and protect every major interface between generation, the bulk grid, and end-use systems.

Utilities, prominently, have begun treating early transformer and switchgear procurement as a competitive lever in an era of accelerated build timelines to accommodate large new loads such as data centers, while engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms report being forced to redesign schedules, reorder work sequences, and lock in equipment earlier than ever as access to scarce grid components increasingly determines which projects can advance and which are pushed into multi-year limbo. In 2025, several consulting firm assessments continued to warn of persistent transformer shortages and an overstretched supply chain. However, some market participants go further, arguing that there is no real shortage and that procurement practices—not manufacturing capacity—are the bottleneck.

The Shortage by the Numbers

In an August 2025 analysis, consulting firm Wood Mackenzie warned that the U.S. transformer market remains structurally out of balance, and that demand continues to outpace any realistic near-term increase in manufacturing capacity. The firm noted that power-transformer demand has risen 119% since 2019, and distribution-transformer demand is up 34%, driven by faster-than-expected load growth, an expanding clean-energy pipeline, and a wave of end-of-life replacements. One of the summary findings put it bluntly: “Supply shortage persists as demand growth remains robust.”

Aging infrastructure is a major contributor, the report notes. According to the analysis, more than half of U.S. distribution transformers—roughly 40 million units—are already beyond their expected service life, adding a steady replacement burden on top of rising new-build requirements. That cumulative pressure helps explain the persistent deficits Wood Mackenzie models for 2025: an estimated 30% shortfall for power transformers and 10% for distribution units across the national fleet.

However, the tightening is most severe in higher-voltage classes. Since 2019, demand for generator step-up units has grown 274%, and substation power transformers are up 116%, reflecting both grid modernization needs and the acceleration of large-scale generation and data center development. Lead times mirror that imbalance. While distribution transformer availability has improved, large units remain locked above two years, with power transformers averaging 128 weeks and GSUs 144 weeks in WoodMac’s second quarter 2025 survey. Meanwhile, costs have also climbed. Since 2019, unit prices have increased 77% for power transformers and 45% for GSUs, with some classes of distribution transformers rising as much as 95%.

For now, even with nearly $1.8 billion in announced North American manufacturing expansions (Figure 1), Wood Mackenzie expects that while some deficits may ease, the “pad-mount three-phase transformer shortage is likely to worsen due to surging industrial demand from data centers, manufacturing facilities, and EV [electric vehicle] charging infrastructure.” The report concludes that without intervention, “extended lead times and elevated costs will become the new normal, potentially derailing grid modernization efforts.”

A Solid Effort to Expand Manufacturing

Still, the severity and duration of the transformer crunch appear to have finally forced a reckoning across the supply chain, prompting the most significant manufacturing buildout the sector has seen in decades. As a historically low-margin, capital-intensive industry, transformer manufacturing is responding to sustained demand growth and a policy environment, despite its vacillation, that prioritizes grid modernization and domestic manufacturing. Over the past year, policy signals around transformer manufacturing have been notably mixed but potentially disruptive.

On one hand, Washington has doubled down on trade measures: copper now faces tariffs of up to 50%, Section 232 steel and aluminum duties have been expanded to hundreds of additional tariff lines, and new “Liberation Day”–style actions have ratcheted up rates on imports from key suppliers such as Brazil, India, and China.

Those moves raise costs for both imported transformers and domestic manufacturers that rely on foreign electrical steel, transformer cores, and copper wire. At the same time, a budget package widely dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” has begun phasing down investment and production tax credits for renewables while tightening foreign‑entity‑of‑concern (FEOC) rules, effectively curbing the use of Chinese‑linked transformer content in projects that depend on federal incentives. But, countering those headwinds, federal and state economic development agencies have leaned into reshoring with tax breaks, loan guarantees, and site selection support for new plants in Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and elsewhere, signaling that long‑term policy risk now favors North American manufacturing—if companies can navigate the near‑term tariff and demand volatility.

Since 2023, manufacturers have committed nearly $2 billion to new or expanded transformer capacity, spanning everything from pole-mount units to 765-kV transmission-class equipment. Hitachi Energy (Figure 2) leads the surge with more than $1 billion in continental investments, including a $457 million facility in South Boston, Virginia—which is set to become the nation’s largest large power transformer plant by 2028—and a $106 million expansion in Alamo, Tennessee, focused on critical components. Siemens Energy is building its first U.S. large power transformer plant in Charlotte, North Carolina, a $150 million project expected to begin production in early 2027. Eaton has committed $340 million to a three-phase transformer facility in South Carolina, also targeting a 2027 start.

Mid-sized and specialized manufacturers are scaling aggressively as well. Prolec GE is investing more than $300 million across new and expanded sites, including a medium-power facility in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and additional pad-mount capacity in Louisiana and Mexico. Virginia Transformer Corp. is undertaking a $40 million expansion in Georgia to boost output by 70%, while WEG is adding transformer capacity in Missouri. Distribution-class expansions include ERMCO’s $70 million-plus investments in Tennessee and Wisconsin, Central Moloney’s new $50 million Florida plant, and MGM Transformer Co.’s 430,000-square-foot facility in Waco, Texas. Even HD Hyundai Electric is enlarging its Alabama footprint, aiming to increase U.S. production by 30% by 2026.

The Transformer Shortage Is Systemic, Not Isolated

While transformers draw the most attention, the transformer shortage is really a transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment shortage. Demand across nearly every major category of electrical infrastructure has surged since 2019—by 35% to 274% depending on the equipment type, according to Making the Connection: Meeting the Electric T&D Supply Chain Challenge, a September 2025 report co-authored by Wood Mackenzie and American Clean Power.

Generation step-up transformers appear to be the most stressed, but high-voltage (HV) switchgear and medium-voltage (MV) circuit breakers are running short, too. Lead times reflect the pressure: switchgear averaged 44 weeks in Q2 2025, while pad-mount transformers, reclosers, and wire and cable all recorded quarterly increases. Prices for these components are also climbing: circuit breakers have jumped 47% since 2021, with medium-voltage switchgear up 50%, as multiple markets compete for scarce manufacturing slots.

The underlying demand drivers remain relentless. Data center expansion, manufacturing construction spending increases of 96% over three years, and a pipeline of renewables projects all push competing demands on the same equipment base. Aging infrastructure adds to the burden: roughly 55% of in-service distribution transformers are more than 33 years old and approaching end-of-life, triggering replacement demand on top of new construction.

For now, tariffs appear to be making matters worse. Evolving trade policy is expected to put “additional upward pressure on both imported and domestically produced equipment,” according to the report, even as expanded Section 232 steel and aluminum duties inflate costs for U.S.-made components. One result may be that utilities and developers cannot solve the constraint by sourcing around one bottleneck. A project team securing transformers on a 12-month timeline may still find switchgear, breakers, or wire in equally tight supply, the report suggests.

Is There Really a Shortage?

Against the prevailing narrative of deficits, long lead times, and constrained factory capacity, some market participants argue that the shortage is overstated. One of the most forceful voices is Patrick Tarver, owner of Bolt Electrical LLC, who describes his firm as “a middleman for different transformer companies throughout the U.S and the world and Mexico.” He characterizes the company as “small, personnel-wise; midsize, money-wise,” and says he serves customers “anywhere in the world that you need to transform.”

Tarver’s central claim challenges the core assumption of the transformer crisis. “There is not a shortage,” he said when asked about the widely cited 30% supply deficit. He asserted that for a standard substation power transformer, once “the initial engineering drawings were approved,” he could have a unit “delivered within 12 to 14 months.” He added that this applies to “all voltage classes” and emphasized, “I’m not the only person that can do this.”

On pricing, Tarver said he typically adds 12% to 15% to factory cost for his services, including staying involved through warranty support. Even with that margin, he argued, “our prices are a lot cheaper than the big four manufacturers, the large manufacturers.” When discussing materials constraints, he rejected much of the industry’s framing: “It’s all exaggerated to drive pricing. I’m telling you that we can get the supplies they need, but they don’t ask.”

For Tarver, the real constraint is access to decision-makers. He contends that the bottleneck lies beyond factory output and more in the structure of utility and EPC procurement, including layers of qualification rules, vendor lists, and internal hierarchies that prevent alternative suppliers from ever reaching the people who could authorize a different approach. In his view, utilities default to familiar equipment manufacturers because their internal processes are designed in ways that reinforce existing relationships rather than evaluate whether faster or more cost-effective options might be available.

If that dynamic is as widespread as he suggests, it implies a supply environment more varied than headline lead times indicate. But it remains difficult to validate without broader engagement from manufacturers and buyers: large power transformers are highly customized, heavily regulated assets, and many utilities face legitimate constraints tied to standards, testing protocols, cybersecurity requirements, and domestic-content rules.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig2-hitachi-varennes-investment-c.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 09:57:51.830061

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has transformed the Environmental Protection Agency in its first year, cutting federal limits on air and water pollution and promoting fossil fuels, a metamorphosis that clashes with the agency’s historic mission to protect human health and the environment.

The administration says its actions will “unleash” the American economy, but environmentalists say the agency’s abrupt change in focus threatens to unravel years of progress on climate-friendly initiatives that could be hard or impossible to reverse.

“It just constantly wants to pat the fossil fuel business on the back and turn back the clock to a pre-Richard Nixon era” when the agency didn’t exist, said historian Douglas Brinkley.

A lot has happened this year at “Trump’s EPA,” as Zeldin frequently calls the agency. Zeldin proposed overturning the landmark finding that climate change is a threat to human health. He pledged to roll back dozens of environmental regulations in “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.” He froze billions of dollars for clean energy and upended agency research.

Zeldin has argued the EPA can protect the environment and grow the economy at the same time. He announced “five pillars” to guide EPA’s work; four were economic goals, including energy dominance — Trump’s shorthand for more fossil fuels — and boosting the auto industry.

Zeldin, a former New York congressman who had a record as a moderate Republican on some environmental issues, said his views on climate change have evolved. Many federal and state climate goals are unattainable in the near future — and come at huge cost, he said.

“We should not be causing … extreme economic pain for an individual or a family” because of policies aimed at “saving the planet,” he told reporters at EPA headquarters in early December.

But scientists and experts say the EPA’s new direction comes at a cost to public health, and would lead to far more pollutants in the environment, including mercury, lead and especially tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs. They also note higher emissions of greenhouse gases will worsen atmospheric warming that is driving more frequent, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the EPA for several years under President George W. Bush, said watching Zeldin attack laws protecting air and water has been “just depressing.”

“It’s tragic for our country. I worry about my grandchildren, of which I have seven. I worry about what their future is going to be if they don’t have clean air, if they don’t have clean water to drink,” she said.

The history behind EPA

The EPA was launched under Nixon in 1970 with pollution disrupting American life, some cities suffocating in smog and some rivers turned into wastelands by industrial chemicals. Congress passed laws then that remain foundational for protecting water, air and endangered species.

The agency’s aggressiveness has always seesawed depending on who occupies the White House. Former President Joe Biden’s administration boosted renewable energy and electric vehicles, tightened motor-vehicle emissions and proposed greenhouse gas limits on coal-fired power plants and oil and gas wells. Industry groups called rules overly burdensome and said the power plant rule would force many aging plants to shut down. In response, many businesses shifted resources to meet the more stringent rules that are now being undone.

“While the Biden EPA repeatedly attempted to usurp the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law to impose its ‘Green New Scam,’ the Trump EPA is laser-focused on achieving results for the American people while operating within the limits of the laws passed by Congress,” EPA spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said.

Zeldin’s list of targets is long

Zeldin has announced plans to abandon soot pollution rules, loosen rules around harmful refrigerants, limit wetlands protections and weaken gas mileage rules. Meanwhile, he would exempt polluting industries and plants from federal emissions-reductions requirements.

Much of EPA’s new direction aligns with Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation road map that argued the agency should gut staffing, cut regulations and end what it called a war on coal on other fossil fuels.

“A lot of the regulations that were put on during the Biden administration were more harmful and restrictive than in any other period. So that’s why deregulating them looks like EPA is making major changes,” said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of Heritage’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment.

But Chris Frey, an EPA official under Biden, said the regulations Zeldin has targeted “offered benefits of avoided premature deaths, of avoided chronic illness … bad things that would not happen because of these rules.”

Matthew Tejada, a former EPA official under both Trump and Biden who now works at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the revamped EPA: “I think it would be hard for them to make it any clearer to polluters in this country that they can go on about their business and not worry about EPA getting in their way.”

Zeldin also has shrunk EPA staffing by about 20% to levels last seen in the mid-1980s.

Justin Chen, president of the EPA’s largest union, called staff cuts “devastating.” He cited the dismantling of research and development offices at labs across the country and the firing of employees who signed a letter of dissent opposing EPA cuts.

Relaxed enforcement and cutting staff

Many of Zeldin’s changes aren’t in effect yet. It takes time to propose new rules, get public input and finalize rollbacks.

It’s much faster to cut grants and ease up on enforcement, and Trump’s EPA is doing both. The number of new civil environmental actions is roughly one-fifth what it was in the first eight months of the Biden administration, according to the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project.

“You can effectively do a lot of deregulation if you just don’t do enforcement,” said Leif Fredrickson, visiting assistant professor of history at the University of Montana.

Hirsch said the number of legal filings isn’t the best way to judge enforcement because they require work outside of the EPA and can bog staff down with burdensome legal agreements. She said the EPA is “focused on efficiently resolving violations and achieving compliance as quickly as possible” and not making demands beyond what the law requires.

EPA’s cuts have been especially hard on climate change programs and environmental justice, the effort to address chronic pollution that typically is worse in minority and poor communities. Both were Biden priorities. Zeldin dismissed staff and canceled billions in grants for projects that fell under the “diversity, equity and inclusion” umbrella, a Trump administration target.

He also spiked a $20 billion “green bank” set up under Biden’s landmark climate law to fund qualifying clean energy projects. Zeldin argued the fund was a scheme to funnel money to Democrat-aligned organizations with little oversight — allegations a federal judge rejected.

Pat Parenteau, an environmental law expert and former director of the Environmental Law School at Vermont Law & Graduate School, said the EPA’s shift under Trump left him with little optimism for what he called “the two most awful crises in the 21st century” — biodiversity loss and climate disruption.

“I don’t see any hope for either one,” he said. “I really don’t. And I’ll be long gone, but I think the world is in just for absolute catastrophe.”

""Some companies say they're a California company, some say they're a Detroit company.","In an echoing studio in Long Beach, California, an ambitious team of designers is trying to reinvent how electric vehicles are made.

Slate Auto has assembled a team of EV engineers from Tesla, Rivian and elsewhere to develop America's least-expensive EV truck. In the warehouse space near construction supply shops and a Western-themed bar, designers have built clay models and prototypes of a customizable EV truck that could cost half as much as the competition.

The company, which has raised more than $700 million from Amazon's Jeff Bezos and others, says it will have a truck on the market next year for roughly $25,000.

How does it plan to keep its sticker price so low?

Buyers will start with a blank slate — a basic truck without power windows or even paint — and can then customize it however they like.

They can pay extra for power windows, speakers, colored wrap or paint. A $5,000 kit even converts the truck into an SUV.

Squeezing out as much cost as possible while making it as easy as Legos to snap on different options has required complex engineering, which is why the company decided to set up its design studio in Southern California.

The region is full of experts.

Although Slate's headquarters is in Troy, Mich., and its vehicles will be manufactured in Indiana, much of how they will look and be assembled came together in the Los Angeles area, said Jeremy Snyder, Slate's chief commercial officer.

""The design presence on the West Coast, specifically in Los Angeles, has been a huge part of the automotive industry for a very long time,"" he said. ""Having that pool of talent that resides here was super important.""

If the idea clicks with enough consumers, company executives are hopeful that their unique business model will bolster widespread EV adoption.

Skeptics say it has yet to be proved that American consumers really want a vehicle broken down to the basics, but thousands of potential EV owners already have shown interest.

More than 150,000 potential buyers put down $50 deposits to reserve their place in line to buy the truck once it is on the market.

A large slice of that demand is coming from Los Angeles, Snyder said.

""Los Angeles has played such a critical role in the zero-emissions auto industry,"" he said. ""I think that it is going to play a very important role in the roll-out of Slate vehicles.""

The company's first deliveries are expected in late 2026.

Slate is entering the EV market at a difficult moment, as demand for green cars has cooled under the Trump administration. The president ended many tax breaks and regulations that were created to nudge more consumers and companies into EVs.

The EV company Rivian laid off more than 600 workers in October, and Tesla sales have slid this year.

Tesla has shown how tough it is to build a business around an affordable EV by putting its own affordable vehicle plans on the back burner.

These days, Elon Musk seems more focused on developing humanoid robots for the masses than on an affordable EV.

Slate thinks that for a radically reduced price, there will be demand. It is imagining that there are customers who don't need four doors, the size or the power of a standard truck or the autonomous driving tech of a Tesla.

Slate's big bet is that a radically reduced sticker price and a new kind of business model can rekindle excitement about the industry. The company is hoping that customers will be thrilled to save the money and then splurge only on the features they want.

""We're going to make the truck, and then after that, you make it yours,"" said Slate's head of communications, Jeff Jablansky.

Slate trucks have a steel frame and external plastic panels that can be wrapped in any color. If customers want to paint their vehicle, they can do it themselves or take it to a partner shop.

The standard version will have an electric range of 150 miles. That can be increased to 240 miles by paying more for a bigger battery.

And those are some of the most obvious options.

Slate's online customization tool gives customers the freedom to design their EV however they want. Jablansky said potential customers have created more than 10 million different configurations of a Slate truck online.

Slate hopes that if it can make EVs more affordable to buy, a new group of consumers will get to experience that EVs also often cost less to own and maintain.

""The entire company was built around this idea of the affordable vehicle,"" Snyder said. ""We scrutinize every accessory in the same way that we scrutinize the vehicle to keep prices as low as possible.""

Although only about 25 of Slate's 500 employees work out of the Long Beach studio, it has a disproportionate effect on the company's product.

To trailblaze and succeed in the harsh EV market, the company decided it needed a presence in California, as well as near the traditional heart of car building in and around Detroit.

""We knew we needed to have a presence in both places to really understand what people wanted,"" Jablansky said. ""Some companies say they're a California company, some say they're a Detroit company. We need to be an American company.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/79/77922f4e-064f-4986-8bfa-8f2282fb574e/69580807eb57b.image.jpg?crop=1851%2C972%2C0%2C74&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-02 23:57:45.685147

Concerns about data centers' impact on electric grids are rising in both red and blue states.
Anger over proposed data centers has even spread to President Donald Trump's primary residential home of Palm Beach County, Florida, where local residents successfully postponed the construction of a proposed 200-acre data center complex.
Corey Kanterman, a local opponent of the proposed data center, told WLRN that his goal is to shut the project down entirely.
""No good comes of having an AI data center near you,"" Kanterman said.","The massive energy needs of artificial intelligence data centers became a major political controversy in 2025, and new reporting suggests that it will grow even further in 2026.

CNBC reported on Thursday that data center projects have become political lightning rods among politicians ranging from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on the left to Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on the right.

However, objections to data centers aren't just coming from politicians but from ordinary citizens who are worried about the impact such projects will have on their local environment and their utility bills.

CNBC noted that data centers' energy needs are so great that PJM Interconnection, the largest US grid operator that serves over 65 million people across 13 states, projects that it will be a full six gigawatts short of its reliability requirements in 2027.

Joe Bowring, president of independent market monitor Monitoring Analytics, told CNBC that he's never seen the grid under such projected strain.

""It’s at a crisis stage right now,"" Bowring said. ""PJM has never been this short.""

Rob Gramlich, president of power consulting firm Grid Strategies, told CNBC that he expects the debate over data centers to become even more intense this year once Americans start getting socked with even higher utility bills.

""I don't think we’ve seen the end of the political repercussions,” Gramlich said. “And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we’ll see a lot of implications. Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents’ policies would raise rates.""

Concerns about data centers' impact on electric grids are rising in both red and blue states.

The Austin American-Statesman reported on Thursday that a new analysis written by the office of Austin City Manager TC Broadnax found that data centers have the potential to overwhelm the city's system given they are projected to need more power than can possibly be delivered with current infrastructure.

""The speed in which AI is trying to be deployed creates tremendous strain on the already tight resources in both design and construction,"" says the analysis, which noted that some proposed data centers are seeking more than five gigawatts, which is more than the peak load for the entire city.

In New York, local station News 10 reported last year that the New York Independent System Operator is estimating that the state's grid could be 1.6 gigawatts short of reliability requirements by 2030 thanks in large part to data centers.

Anger over proposed data centers has even spread to President Donald Trump's primary residential home of Palm Beach County, Florida, where local residents successfully postponed the construction of a proposed 200-acre data center complex.

According to public news station WLRN, locals opposed to the project cited ""expected noise from cooling towers, servers, and diesel generators, along with heavy water use, pollution concerns, and higher utility costs"" when petitioning Palm Beach County commissioners to scrap the proposal.

Corey Kanterman, a local opponent of the proposed data center, told WLRN that his goal is to shut the project down entirely.

BYD, by contrast, increased battery-electric vehicle sales both for the quarter and the full year, delivering almost 2.26 million EVs in 2025 to Tesla’s 1.64 million.
BYD pulled away from Tesla last year after coming up just shy of the world leader in 2024.
Through the first 11 months of last year, BYD registered more cars than Tesla in both Germany and the U.K., the region’s two biggest EV markets.
Tesla’s sales across Europe fell 28% during that span, and the company posted steep December declines in France, Spain and Sweden.","Tesla Inc. ceded the title of world’s top seller of electric cars to China’s BYD Co., squandering a lead the Elon Musk-led company built as it popularized plug-in vehicles over the past decade.

The U.S. automaker reported a 16% decline in fourth quarter deliveries, trailing analyst estimates. For the year of 2025, Tesla sales slid almost 9%, its second consecutive annual drop.

BYD, by contrast, increased battery-electric vehicle sales both for the quarter and the full year, delivering almost 2.26 million EVs in 2025 to Tesla’s 1.64 million.

Investors have paid little mind of late to Tesla’s decline in the global EV pecking order, with Musk prioritizing artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The chief executive officer has drawn attention away from Tesla’s core business by touting progress in his longstanding effort to start a robotaxi service.

Standing up those operations will be crucial in 2026, given the outlook for EV demand in the U.S., Tesla’s largest market. President Donald Trump’s administration has ceased federal incentives supporting plug-in vehicle purchases and hollowed out fuel economy and emissions regulations that had generated billions of dollars in revenue for the company.

“Deliveries barely matter anymore,” Alexander Potter, an analyst with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, said in a note on January 2. Instead, the performance of Tesla’s shares in 2026 “should be driven by progress in AI and robotics.”

AI Emphasis

Wall Street had been bracing for a “hangover” for Tesla after tax credits for EV purchases ended in the U.S., William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note. He similarly posited that the company “is valued almost entirely on the transformation to real-world AI.”

Tesla shares fell 2.8% as of 1:35 p.m. on January 2 in New York. The stock advanced 11% last year, paring gains after hitting an all-time high in mid-December 2025.

BYD pulled away from Tesla last year after coming up just shy of the world leader in 2024. While the Chinese manufacturer delivered more fully electric cars in the fourth quarter of that year, Tesla maintained a slim lead on an annual basis.

In addition to selling far more EVs in China — where some of its cars are far cheaper than Tesla’s most affordable vehicle, the Model 3 — BYD has been surging in Europe.

Through the first 11 months of last year, BYD registered more cars than Tesla in both Germany and the U.K., the region’s two biggest EV markets. Tesla’s sales across Europe fell 28% during that span, and the company posted steep December declines in France, Spain and Sweden.

2026 Outlook

Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical about Tesla’s 2026 sales prospects. This time two years ago, analysts were predicting Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles. The average estimate has plunged to around 1.8 million.

Tesla’s energy storage battery business, on the other hand, has never been stronger.

The company deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of energy storage products in the last quarter of 2025, up from the 11 gigawatt hours a year earlier. Total deployments for the year jumped almost 50% to 46.7 gigawatt hours.

“The sustained growth of energy storage reflects structural tailwinds from AI-driven electricity demand, which is driving incremental storage requirements to support data center buildouts and power grid stabilization,” Tom Narayan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock, said in a note.

Tesla ended last year by building anticipation for Cybercab, a two-seat compact car with butterfly doors. While prototypes have lacked a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm told Bloomberg News in October that the company will sell the car with those components if required by regulators.

While Tesla began driverless testing with Model Ys in Austin late last month, consumers thus far are only able to summon rides from small numbers of cars in the Texas capital and the San Francisco Bay area with safety supervisors in the front seats.

For his part, Musk is optimistic about the year ahead.",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2025/06/21/TESLAS-IN-CALIFORNIA-BLOOMBERG.jpg?height=635&t=1750534362&width=1200,N,,2026-01-02 23:57:31.067187

Listen to the WPR report Milwaukee’s Pettit Center indoor Olympic speedskating oval goes solar was originally published by Wisconsin Public Radio.","The Pettit National Ice Center has made Milwaukee a destination for the Olympic speedskating world. Now, the first indoor speedskating oval built in the U.S. is going solar.

The arena contains enough ice to fill more than five National Hockey League rinks. Like most ice centers, it requires a significant amount of energy to keep its skating surface frozen and dry.

The solar project will cut the 200,000-square-foot facility’s energy use by at least 20 percent and power the building during summer months.

It’s funded by a large donation gifted to the nonprofit by the climate-focused VoLo Foundation.

Paul Golomski is the Pettit Ice Center’s general manager. He believes the project will help the facility use energy more responsibly.

“There’s only five (indoor speedskating ovals) in North America, and there’s only 40 operating in the entire world,” Golomski said. “So I think it’s a really smart thing for us to invest in and to ensure that we’re being responsible stewards of our energy consumption.”

He says over a 20-year period, the system will have the impact of reducing the center’s CO2 emissions by 12,778 tons. That’s equal to 191,000 trees planted, or 29,053,530 miles driven by cars.

Milwaukee-based renewable energy company Arch Solar is leading the project — a 690-kilowatt system consisting of 1,200 bifacial solar panels. This allows each panel to absorb sunlight from its front and back sides, producing more energy.

Andrew Holmstrom is the business development supervisor at Arch Solar. He said the panels will generate enough energy to power a string of Christmas lights from Milwaukee to North Carolina.

“It’s going to be a clean, green rooftop power plant,” Holmstrom said.

Holmstrom previously lived across the highway from the ice center.

“I’ve been able to skate on the ice there, run inside there, and so to be able to be a part of this project and kind of leave our fingerprint on the building, it means so much,” Holmstrom said.

Arch Solar has been on the roof since late November. They hope to have it ready by early April.

The Pettit National Ice Center is an official training site for U.S. Speedskating. It opened in 1992. The facility will host the U.S. Olympic Team Trials Long Track competition Jan. 2-5.

The federal judge considering whether states can ban new gas- and diesel-powered vehicles has indicated he will not weigh the economic interests of disputing parties, including farmers who grow corn for ethanol.

U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. in Oakland has rejected motions from corn growers, truckers, Tesla and others to intervene in a lawsuit between blue states and President Trump.

The financial stakes are high, Gilliam acknowledged in a ruling last month. But the case will turn on whether Congress lawfully retracted federal permission for states to prohibit internal-combustion engines, he said.

The Biden Environmental Protection Agency gave permission by waiving less-strict federal vehicle emission standards. “Critically, this case is not about whether the EPA’s earlier decision to issue the waivers was itself lawful, prudent or good policy,” Gilliam wrote.

Value of EV credits at risk

In June, California, Oregon, Washington and eight other states sued the day Trump signed three congressional resolutions overturning the Biden EPA waivers.

The waivers allowed California and like-minded states to make automakers sell more zero-emission vehicles. One waiver let states ban new cars and pickups powered by fossil fuels beginning in 2035.

The states argue the Congressional Review Act allows lawmakers to overturn agency “rules,” but not “waivers” that only apply to certain states. The Justice Department argues the states don’t have standing to sue Trump over something Congress did.

Texas and private organizations representing the ethanol, trucking, petroleum and construction industries moved to join the lawsuit.

They cited their financial interests in preserving demand for fossil fuels, including ethanol. Some said they were concerned the next White House administration might not be as keen in defending against the lawsuit.

Gilliam said if he adopted that argument, then the government could never adequately represent anyone’s interests.

The Zero Emission Transportation Association, whose members include Tesla, moved to intervene on the side of the blue states.

Investments totaling billions of dollars depend on California’s stringent vehicle emission regulations, the association said in its motion to intervene.

EV makers receive credits for selling zero-emission vehicles and sell them to other automakers. Makers of conventional vehicles need the credits to comply with blue-state emission standards.

“These credits are an important source of revenue for electric vehicle manufacturers,” according to the association. “But as a result of the resolutions, these credits will lose nearly all of their value.”

The National Corn Growers Association and corn farmer associations in 11 states appealed Gilliam’s ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Dec. 31.

— Nick Ogilvie

CELINA, TX, UNITED STATES, January 2, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — As artificial turf continues its rapid expansion across residential, commercial, athletic, and municipal applications, industry leaders are increasingly focused on long-term performance, safety, and sustainability. One of the earliest and most influential figures shaping this shift is Nick Ogilvie, an artificial turf pioneer based in Celina, Texas, whose work spans more than two decades and nearly every major climate region in the United States.

Ogilvie is widely recognized within the industry for advancing artificial turf beyond surface-level installation and toward fully engineered systems designed for longevity, sanitation, and real-world performance. His career includes industry-first installations, nationally recognized certifications, proprietary product development, and extensive consulting work supporting artificial turf companies and facilities across the country.

National Experience Across Diverse Climates

Over the course of his career, Ogilvie has installed and consulted on artificial turf projects from Los Angeles, California, to Burlington, Vermont, and as far south as Sunset Key, Florida. His work spans arid desert conditions, coastal hurricane zones, cold-weather regions, and high-traffic commercial environments.

Industry professionals note that this geographic diversity has contributed to Ogilvie’s reputation as a system-level expert, with firsthand experience in how synthetic turf behaves under varying environmental, structural, and usage demands. In addition to his consulting work, Ogilvie has led installations through his company, Luxe Blades, assisting property owners, developers, and organizations with both new construction and remediation of underperforming turf systems.

Industry-First Installations and Certifications

Among Ogilvie’s most notable achievements is being the first to design and install an artificial turf Par 3 golf hole on the rim of Palo Duro Canyon, one of the most challenging natural landscapes in the United States. The project required advanced engineering solutions addressing wind exposure, drainage, and sub-base stability in a high-risk environment.

Ogilvie is also the only artificial turf installer to hold a certified wind uplift approval for rooftop turf installations under Miami-Dade Code, validated through independent testing and documentation by Haag Global. This certification is considered a benchmark for rooftop turf safety, particularly in hurricane-prone regions, and has helped establish artificial turf as a code-compliant architectural surface.

Product Innovation Driven by Field Experience

In addition to installation and consulting, Ogilvie has played a central role in developing products designed specifically for artificial turf systems—addressing gaps long recognized by industry professionals.

He developed Luxe Bond Pro, a proprietary turf adhesive engineered to withstand extreme heat, moisture, and shear forces commonly encountered in rooftop and high-stress turf installations. The adhesive was created in response to repeated failures observed with generic construction products not designed for synthetic turf applications.

Ogilvie also helped pioneer the first battery-powered artificial turf power broom, developed to restore turf fibers, rebalance infill, and improve surface drainage without damaging turf backing or seams. The innovation marked a shift away from improvised maintenance tools toward equipment engineered exclusively for artificial turf.

Advancing Eco-Conscious Turf Maintenance

Recognizing growing concerns around sanitation, pet safety, and environmental impact, Ogilvie contributed to the development of a fully natural cleaner and deodorizer designed specifically for artificial turf.

The product is:

Eco-friendly and pet-safe

Designed to eliminate odor-causing organic material at the source

Whole Foods EcoCompliant, making it the only artificial turf cleaner in the industry to meet that standard

The formulation also includes a natural, proprietary static-release technology, addressing static buildup commonly associated with synthetic turf surfaces—an issue long noted by facility managers and turf professionals.

Addressing the Industry’s Maintenance Gap

As artificial turf adoption accelerates nationwide, Ogilvie has consistently highlighted what many in the industry now acknowledge as a critical issue: turf systems are often installed correctly but lack proper long-term maintenance protocols.

Organic buildup, infill compaction, bacterial growth, and fiber fatigue can compromise turf performance, safety, and lifespan. Ogilvie’s work has focused on developing maintenance solutions that protect the integrity of turf systems while extending their usable life.

Industry observers note that his approach has helped shift the conversation from “maintenance-free” marketing claims toward realistic, performance-based stewardship of synthetic turf assets.

A Recognized Voice in a Maturing Industry

With artificial turf increasingly used in public spaces, sports facilities, rooftops, and pet environments, scrutiny around safety, compliance, and lifecycle cost continues to rise. Ogilvie’s experience—spanning installation, certification, product development, and maintenance—positions him as a recognized voice in the industry’s ongoing maturation.

Rather than focusing on short-term trends, his work emphasizes accountability, system integrity, and long-term value.

“Artificial turf has matured into permanent infrastructure, not a novelty surface,” said Nick Ogilvie. “As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential.”

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK -- Tesla lost its crown as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk's right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It's a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world's richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was down nearly 2% at $441.15 in early afternoon trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business. He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory - and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin earlier this year, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

""Regulatory is going to be a big issue,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. ""We're dealing with people's lives.""

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla's autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla's directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world's first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

A small section of the Lake/Orange Expressway (State Road 516) is set to link U.S. 27 with State Road 429, and it will have wireless charging beneath its surface that enables EVs to be charged when on the go.

How the Wireless Charging Lane Works in Florida

Under the pilot, they’ll generate a magnetic field by using inductive coils embedded in the roadway to transfer energy to a receiver mounted on the underside of a vehicle. As the car, bus, or truck drives over powered sections, juice flows into the battery without your needing to plug in — ever. Details of the project plans as described by regional officials and reported by TechSpot indicate the energized stretch will measure about three-quarters of a mile, with receivers able to accommodate up to 200 kilowatts — enough to help extend an EV’s range in ways that are more meaningful than wireless smartphone charging but far below what a full charge would take.

Dynamic wireless charging relies on the same concepts as static systems, but has to keep an energy connection in place while traveling at highway speeds and through inches of asphalt. Engineers usually adjust the system to work at specific frequencies and divide coils so that only a portion under a vehicle is charged, improving efficiency and safety. The industry is converging on interoperability through standardization efforts like SAE’s J2954 family of documents, which seeks to establish a common language between vehicles and road hardware.

A Living Testbed on Florida’s New SR 516 Corridor

The CFX is developing SR 516 as a smart corridor that integrates transportation with technology and environmental design. Alongside the wireless charging pilot, there are plans for solar installations that will power roadside systems, wildlife crossings that protect habitat, and a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. The expressway will open in phases later this decade, and engineers will have a chance to collect data on methods of construction, power delivery, and pavement life.

The perfect proving ground is the state of Florida. Now the second-largest state in terms of EV registrations, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, Florida gets that mix with its blend of commuter traffic and freight movement that make up real-world duty cycles for testing heavy vehicles. If the pilot proves it performs well in heat, humidity, and seasonal storms, it may bolster the case for scaling the technology elsewhere.

Why This Might Change EV Economics for Fleets

Ultimately, continuous top-ups along key corridors might allow vehicles to carry smaller batteries without sacrificing range — a huge thing for trucks and buses, in which the mass of the battery and its associated cost weigh heavily on total ownership costs. Modeling from national labs and industry pilots suggests that dynamic charging lanes can lead to double-digit reductions in battery capacity (on the order of 20–40 percent in some freight scenarios) while still staying on schedule.

Vallee believes more widespread adoption could also relieve some of the burden on stationary fast-charging hubs, which often need grid upgrades and big pieces of real estate. Rather than supplanting plug-in charging, dynamic lanes would complement it, adding energy during the most predictable times and locations: on busy commuter and freight corridors. That dovetails with the buildout of public charging paid for by federal and state programs and by private networks, especially as utilities prepare for heavier loads on highways.

Lessons From Other Pilots in the U.S. and Abroad

The Florida approach is part of a wave of real-world tests. In Michigan, the state worked with Electreon to create a short inductive roadway in Detroit within a broader mobility district. The state transportation department and Purdue University are looking into conductive concrete ideas for truck corridors in Indiana. Overseas, the Gotland project in Sweden showed dynamic charging for buses and trucks on public roads, and Germany tested overhead “eHighway” catenary systems for freight. Each model trades off hardware complexity, vehicle modifications, and cost in different ways; Florida’s in-road induction dispenses with pantographs or overhead wires, seeking a more unobtrusive fit into existing road profiles.

Hurdles Still to Clear Before Wider Deployment

Cost and coordination are still the largest concerns. Mounting coils, power electronics, and utility connections inflate construction and maintenance budgets, and early pilots elsewhere have commanded multimillion-dollar price tags even for short stretches. Agencies will also require clear business models to bill, operate, and upgrade the vehicles — as well as a mechanism for correctly metering energy per vehicle.

Vehicle compatibility is another important consideration. Only EVs with the appropriate receiver will be able to benefit; as a consequence, standards and OEM adoption are vital. On safety, the researchers say systems are engineered to comply with international exposure standards and only power up when a vehicle associated with one is nearby. Agencies will still check for electromagnetic interference and gauge pavement life cycle and performance in standing water before advancing the new technology more broadly.

What to Watch Next as Florida Builds SR 516

Once construction goes forward, see whether the energy-delivered-per-mile data bears out, whether the ramp offers good performance at various speeds, and how Florida’s climate affects aging over time. It is currently unclear if bus fleets and logistics operators will participate, but heavy vehicles should ultimately benefit the most from dynamic charging.

Last year, BYD saw a 28% in sales by selling 2.26 million vehicles. Notably, BYD did not make any sales to American consumers.

Meanwhile, Tesla, which was riddled with controversy due to CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration, sold 1.64 million vehicles last year, marking a 9% drop in sales from the year prior. 2025 marked the second year in a row that Musk’s company experienced a slump in yearly sales.

With Musk taking on the role of leading the Department of Government Efficiency at the beginning of Trump’s second term, he was met with widespread criticism by government employees and liberals alike for his cavalier approach in administrating widespread firings and audits of the federal government.

Protests at Tesla showrooms and dealerships erupted across the country to pushback against Musk. Many of these “Tesla Takedown” campaigns turned violent with showrooms vandalized and vehicles set on fire.

By the end of Tesla’s first quarter, Tesla saw a 71% drop in earnings. Shortly after, Musk announced he would be ending his role with the Trump administration. However, his announcement also corresponded with the end of his 130 day legal limit as a special government employee.

Tesla has also had to navigate the Trump administration’s decision to not extend a $7,500 federal EV tax credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The EV tax credit expired in September.

The Korean automaker went big on a family of EVs with long-distance range, class-leading fast-charging and exceptional style. And it even held up the U.S., its most important market, as the place where these cars would be manufactured. But it still got bruised by tariffs, the end of the EV tax credits and even an immigration raid in 2025. Needless to say, the game has changed just a bit.

But Hyundai's push continues in 2026. The Hyundai Ioniq 3 is one of several more affordably priced EVs due to hit the global market this year, alongside the Volkswagen ID. Polo, the reborn Chevrolet Bolt, the Slate Truck and more. As the EV market shifts from wealthy early adopters to more mainstream customers looking for value, Hyundai certainly doesn't want to miss out.

And as Korea's JoongAng Daily reports today, the Ioniq 3 could in some ways be Hyundai's most important EV yet. That's because it's targeted specifically at Europe, a market that's suddenly a priority as President Donald Trump's 15% tariffs on Korean-imported cars start to sting its bottom line. In other words, Hyundai needs the Ioniq 3 to be successful to aid its global EV push and to reduce the pressure on the suddenly more difficult American market. (While Hyundai produces many cars in the U.S., it is still dependent on imports from Korea, including for car parts.)

More importantly, the Ioniq 3 will do battle in a place where EV sales aren't really slowing down, unlike the U.S. In Europe, it will be positioned against the upcoming compact Volkswagen EV, various models from BYD and other Chinese brands, electric newcomers from Renault and Stellantis, and much more. Hyundai cannot afford to miss out there; the Ioniq 3 has tremendous potential to be a volume-seller EV. (Plus, South Korea now has plenty of competition from Chinese carmakers, too, so it cannot stand down in its home market.)

So what can we expect from the Ioniq 3? We don't know what its final form will be yet. But it was previewed by the Concept Three at last fall's IAA Munich auto show in Germany. That concept was a radical, almost Veloster-like hatchback with sharp window lines, a translucent duckbill spoiler, a thin LED light bar up front, and Hyundai's signature pixelated lights. While the final design will certainly be toned down, Hyundai has a good track record of keeping its concept cars close to the real thing.

The Ioniq 3 is expected to be a close counterpart to the Kia EV3, a compact EV that has been a strong seller everywhere it's available. As such, it is expected to use a 400-volt version of Hyundai's E-GMP electric platform, with front- or all-wheel-drive, and powered by either a 58.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack and a larger 81.4-kWh unit. Prices in the €30,000 range seem likely.

As we track this surge of next-generation EVs with better value propositions, we'll definitely be watching the Ioniq 3's progress. But will it come stateside? Considering that Kia's Korean-made EV3 is perpetually MIA in the U.S., that feels unlikely for now. With any luck, Hyundai could also find a way to bring it to buyers seeking electric style and value here, too.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk, who once dismissed BYD as a threat. Tesla’s rise had seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make Musk the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2026/01/TeslaAP26002455610143.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-02 18:57:43.683971

As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential”

— Nick Ogilvie

CELINA, TX, UNITED STATES, January 2, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — As artificial turf continues its rapid expansion across residential, commercial, athletic, and municipal applications, industry leaders are increasingly focused on long-term performance, safety, and sustainability. One of the earliest and most influential figures shaping this shift is Nick Ogilvie, an artificial turf pioneer based in Celina, Texas, whose work spans more than two decades and nearly every major climate region in the United States.

Ogilvie is widely recognized within the industry for advancing artificial turf beyond surface-level installation and toward fully engineered systems designed for longevity, sanitation, and real-world performance. His career includes industry-first installations, nationally recognized certifications, proprietary product development, and extensive consulting work supporting artificial turf companies and facilities across the country.

National Experience Across Diverse Climates

Over the course of his career, Ogilvie has installed and consulted on artificial turf projects from Los Angeles, California, to Burlington, Vermont, and as far south as Sunset Key, Florida. His work spans arid desert conditions, coastal hurricane zones, cold-weather regions, and high-traffic commercial environments.

Industry professionals note that this geographic diversity has contributed to Ogilvie’s reputation as a system-level expert, with firsthand experience in how synthetic turf behaves under varying environmental, structural, and usage demands. In addition to his consulting work, Ogilvie has led installations through his company, Luxe Blades, assisting property owners, developers, and organizations with both new construction and remediation of underperforming turf systems.

Industry-First Installations and Certifications

Among Ogilvie’s most notable achievements is being the first to design and install an artificial turf Par 3 golf hole on the rim of Palo Duro Canyon, one of the most challenging natural landscapes in the United States. The project required advanced engineering solutions addressing wind exposure, drainage, and sub-base stability in a high-risk environment.

Ogilvie is also the only artificial turf installer to hold a certified wind uplift approval for rooftop turf installations under Miami-Dade Code, validated through independent testing and documentation by Haag Global. This certification is considered a benchmark for rooftop turf safety, particularly in hurricane-prone regions, and has helped establish artificial turf as a code-compliant architectural surface.

Product Innovation Driven by Field Experience

In addition to installation and consulting, Ogilvie has played a central role in developing products designed specifically for artificial turf systems—addressing gaps long recognized by industry professionals.

He developed Luxe Bond Pro, a proprietary turf adhesive engineered to withstand extreme heat, moisture, and shear forces commonly encountered in rooftop and high-stress turf installations. The adhesive was created in response to repeated failures observed with generic construction products not designed for synthetic turf applications.

Ogilvie also helped pioneer the first battery-powered artificial turf power broom, developed to restore turf fibers, rebalance infill, and improve surface drainage without damaging turf backing or seams. The innovation marked a shift away from improvised maintenance tools toward equipment engineered exclusively for artificial turf.

Advancing Eco-Conscious Turf Maintenance

Recognizing growing concerns around sanitation, pet safety, and environmental impact, Ogilvie contributed to the development of a fully natural cleaner and deodorizer designed specifically for artificial turf.

The product is:

Eco-friendly and pet-safe

Designed to eliminate odor-causing organic material at the source

Whole Foods EcoCompliant, making it the only artificial turf cleaner in the industry to meet that standard

The formulation also includes a natural, proprietary static-release technology, addressing static buildup commonly associated with synthetic turf surfaces—an issue long noted by facility managers and turf professionals.

Addressing the Industry’s Maintenance Gap

As artificial turf adoption accelerates nationwide, Ogilvie has consistently highlighted what many in the industry now acknowledge as a critical issue: turf systems are often installed correctly but lack proper long-term maintenance protocols.

Organic buildup, infill compaction, bacterial growth, and fiber fatigue can compromise turf performance, safety, and lifespan. Ogilvie’s work has focused on developing maintenance solutions that protect the integrity of turf systems while extending their usable life.

Industry observers note that his approach has helped shift the conversation from “maintenance-free” marketing claims toward realistic, performance-based stewardship of synthetic turf assets.

A Recognized Voice in a Maturing Industry

With artificial turf increasingly used in public spaces, sports facilities, rooftops, and pet environments, scrutiny around safety, compliance, and lifecycle cost continues to rise. Ogilvie’s experience—spanning installation, certification, product development, and maintenance—positions him as a recognized voice in the industry’s ongoing maturation.

Rather than focusing on short-term trends, his work emphasizes accountability, system integrity, and long-term value.

“Artificial turf has matured into permanent infrastructure, not a novelty surface,” said Nick Ogilvie. “As adoption grows, the industry has to take responsibility for how these systems perform years after installation. Longevity, safety, and proper maintenance are no longer optional—they’re essential.”

The definition of WOTUS affects permitting timelines, project costs, and compliance obligations for industries such as construction, energy, and agriculture.
Background: Importance of the WOTUS Definition The CWA regulates “navigable waters,” defined as WOTUS.
These changes are expected to limit federal oversight, especially in arid regions and areas with seasonal water flow.
.” This change means that even if an upstream portion of a stream met the relatively permanent definition, it would not be considered a tributary if a downstream portion of the stream fails to meet the relatively permanent definition.","On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a proposed rule to update the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

This definition determines the scope of federal jurisdiction for key CWA programs, including permitting for discharges and construction projects.

Why does this matter?

The definition of WOTUS affects permitting timelines, project costs, and compliance obligations for industries such as construction, energy, and agriculture. If finalized, the new rule will likely reduce federal jurisdiction, meaning fewer waterbodies will fall under CWA regulation.

The Agencies are accepting public comments until January 5, 2026—a short window given the holidays.

Background: Importance of the WOTUS Definition

The CWA regulates “navigable waters,” defined as WOTUS. Programs that depend on this definition include:

Section 402 (NPDES) – permits for pollutant discharges

Section 404 – permits for dredged or fill material

However, the Act itself does not define WOTUS. Over decades, rulemakings, court decisions, and injunctions have created confusion and regional differences.

Currently, WOTUS includes five categories of waters (e.g., navigable waters, tributaries, wetlands with continuous surface connection) and excludes eight other types (e.g., waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, certain ditches).

The new proposal aims to align with the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which narrowed federal jurisdiction over wetlands.

Key Proposed Changes

If adopted, the rule would:

Remove “interstate waters” from the definition of WOTUS;

Add definitions for the following terms:

“Relatively Permanent;”

“Tributary;” and

“Continuous Surface Connection;” and

Modify exclusions of water treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and certain ditches and add an exclusion of groundwater from the definition of WOTUS.

These changes are expected to limit federal oversight, especially in arid regions and areas with seasonal water flow. Overall, the Agencies estimate that only 19% of wetlands in the National Wetlands Inventory would be jurisdictional under this approach.

New Defined Terms

The Agencies propose to add the following defined terms to further clarify the meaning of WOTUS and to align with the Sackett decision.

“Relatively Permanent”

The Agencies propose defining “relatively permanent” as “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” This term is relevant because tributaries, lakes, ponds, and wetlands must meet that definition to qualify as WOTUS and fall within the CWA’s jurisdiction. Under this proposed definition, “ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation (e.g., rain or snowfall)) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent.” Further, the Agencies intend the qualification of “at least during the wet season” “to include extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season . . . .” If finalized, many features would likely fall outside the Act’s jurisdiction depending on the hydrology in a certain location—particularly in more arid regions, which may only have water flow during infrequent, but significant, precipitation events.

“Tributary”

The Agencies propose to incorporate the term ‘relatively permanent’ into the definition of a “tributary” as “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and banks, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” Much of the geographic scope of WOTUS is based on tributaries of navigable waters rather than the navigable waters themselves. As a result, this definition and the definition of “relatively permanent” are critical components of the jurisdictional reach of the CWA.

Importantly, the Agencies propose that “[f]eatures with non-relatively permanent flow . . . would sever jurisdiction upstream . . . , including flow through non-relatively permanent reaches or streams or wetlands . . . .” This change means that even if an upstream portion of a stream met the relatively permanent definition, it would not be considered a tributary if a downstream portion of the stream fails to meet the relatively permanent definition. The Agencies note that this approach may be more likely to affect features “in the arid West and mountainous regions” where “[h]ydrologic regime shifts of relatively permanent flow to non-relatively permanent flow back to relatively permanent flow may be commonly found.”

“Continuous Surface Connection”

The Agencies propose to define “continuous surface connection” to mean “having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.” Effectively, this definition creates a two-prong test to determine whether wetlands, ponds, and lakes qualify as WOTUS—i.e., (a) having surface water during the wet season and (b) abutting another WOTUS. For wetlands, the Agencies also explain that “only the portion of an abutting wetland which demonstrates surface water at least during the wet season would be jurisdictional.” The Agencies recognize that this Rule would likely result in the elimination of many wetlands from coverage under the CWA and estimate that only 19% of total National Wetland Inventory wetlands would fall within the Act’s jurisdiction.

Next Steps

The Proposed Rule likely will result in fewer waterbodies qualifying as WOTUS and therefore subject to regulation under the CWA; however, this Rule likely will also result in a clearer operating directive to regulators and regulated entities implementing the CWA. The Agencies will accept comments in support of or against the Proposed Rule through January 5, 2026.

We expect that the agencies will publish a final rule within the next six months, given the agencies’ stated intent to promptly clarify the regulations for regulated parties and given that the Supreme Court already did the heavy analytical lifting for the agencies. Additionally, we expect the final rule to be largely identical to the proposed rule for the same reason that the purpose of the rulemaking is to incorporate the Sackett decision, so there is little policy choice involved that may change in response to comments.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2026-01/environment%20energy%20legislation%20election%20regulation%20environmental%20protection%20agency%20epa%20sign%20top.jpg.webp?itok=H4fcWQ9t,N,,2026-01-02 17:58:16.814339

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total may likely have been impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%, as investors hope Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.

Denmark’s Ørsted filed a legal challenge on Thursday against the White House’s decision 10 days ago to suspend the lease for its Revolution Wind site as part of a sweeping move halting all construction of offshore wind.

The attempted injunction is the latest in a series of legal volleys between the renewables industry and Donald Trump, whose administration has sought to block major offshore wind projects from moving ahead since his re-election.

Trump, a vocal supporter of the fossil fuel industry, opposes renewable energy, and wind in particular, saying he finds turbines ugly, costly and inefficient.

On 22 December, officials from the Department of the Interior suspended the leases for five large offshore wind projects that are under construction in US waters over unspecified “national security risks”.

A statement from Ørsted and its partner in the Revolution project, Skyborn Renewables, described the move as a violation of applicable law.

“Litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the project,” and avoid “substantial harm” to the project if the suspension order remained in place, according to the statement.

“Revolution Wind secured all required federal and state permits in 2023, following extensive reviews that began more than nine years ago,” it said.

The move emerged months after the Trump administration issued a “stop-work order” against construction of the Revolution project in August, citing a need to “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests”.

The halt to construction sent shockwaves through the industry and pushed the market value of Ørsted, which is partially owned by the Danish state, to record lows. No details of the national security issues were provided by the White House and weeks later a federal judge allowed Ørsted to restart work on the project.

At the time, Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island senator and ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, said: “If Trump’s plan is to raise families’ energy prices, cut American jobs, turbo charge climate change, and accelerate the Great Climate Insurance Crisis, he’s knocking it out of the park with his all-out attack on American offshore wind.”

Construction is now almost 90% complete and the site had been due to begin delivering “reliable, affordable power” to US homes in 2026. Ørsted said it had already installed all offshore foundations and 58 of the project’s 65 wind turbines.

Ørsted shares, which had taken another 12% plunge after the 22 December announcement, were lifted by nearly 4% on Friday on news of the court action.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eab550bc8bf970a9b0998029f89ed3d68f767379/576_0_4182_3346/master/4182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b6e0c060f6bab9c265e907962d673e7",N,,2026-01-02 16:13:04.782121

Automotive prices have surpassed record levels at a point when many Americans are struggling to pay bills. However industry leaders are reportedly trying to wiggle out of the event.

Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), pitched the hearings as Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. He previously expressed concerns that government mandates and environmental regulations were playing a major role in elevating U.S. vehicle prices — which presently hover around a record $50,000 average transaction.

With the presumed emphasis on deregulation, one would assume the automakers would be eager to address Congress. However, it was reported last month that Ford CEO Jim Farley was seeking to snub the hearing on the grounds that Elon Musk wouldn’t be there. Tesla was instead sending Lars Morvay, who serves as the company’s VP of engineering

From Politco:

In the Dec. 12 letter, Farley told Cruz through a lawyer that he has a scheduling conflict on the day of the hearing, Jan. 14. In addition, he said the proposed hearing was unfair to other auto executives because it invites “witnesses of different seniorities.”

The Commerce Committee announced in November that it had invited the CEOs of Ford, GM and Stellantis. But for Tesla, the announced witness was the company’s vice president of vehicle engineering.

“As previously discussed with your staff, Ford believes that it is essential that any potential hearing adhere to Congress’s longstanding tradition of ensuring comparable treatment for similarly situated companies,” wrote Brian Smith, a lawyer for Covington & Burling, which represents Ford. Smith added that “if a vice president of engineering is appropriate for the planned hearing, the other companies should have the opportunity to offer a similar witness.”

The Detroit News has since reported that General Motors is following suit. A GM spokesperson has confirmed that ""CEO Mary Barra will attend the hearing if the other companies’ CEOs do the same."" Meanwhile, there have been no official statements regarding Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa.

It’s a similar story with the Japanese brands, which don’t appear to have been invited by Cruz in the first place. This is interesting because several Japanese automakers have massive manufacturing footprints inside the United States. Toyota also tends to lead in terms of U.S. sales most years, with Honda often jockeying for position with Ford and General Motors.

This emphasis on Elon Musk being (or not being) present for the hearings feels rather trivial when Congress doesn’t even seem interested in hearing from representatives of all brands. But this has remained the focus of both the industry and the media.

Cruz has stated that he opted against inviting the Tesla CEO because of concerns that would shift focus away from the core issues and toward his previous role in government — specifically the short lived Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that now looks to have been disbanded by the Trump administration.

It’s not clear whether he’s afraid of what Musk might say about government policy or that the public response would revolve around Elon as a media personality. Perhaps both, as the latter item has already become a problem.

As far as the affordability hearings, which are scheduled to kick off on January 14th, automakers could use it as an opportunity to explain their position to the public while attempting to convince legislators to ease off on regulations. Cruz at least seems highly amenable toward deregulation and the Trump administration has shown similar proclivities.

Tariffs, despite not being the focus of the talks, could also come up — with automakers having previously expressed concerns on how they impact operating costs.

But it’s not abundantly clear that automakers actually want lower prices. While regulations have undoubtedly encouraged elevated MSRPs, companies have likewise been chasing higher margins on vehicles by offering fewer affordable models over the years. Many brands have been able to maintain steady profits despite lower annual volumes.

Financing is another topic automakers would probably like to avoid. Controlling debt and interest has become increasingly lucrative, with financing now comprising anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of dealership profits. While those entities aren't always linked to manufacturers, automakers absolutely have captive finance companies of their own.

Publicly discussing all that at a point where their customers are less-than pleased with the industry and its current products may not go over well. Meanwhile, few individuals in Congress have showcased any sound understanding of the auto industry and hearings often just devolve into long stints of lecturing to win brownie points with voters. The industry likely prefers to deal with the government via lobbying efforts whenever possible, particularly when the alternative could lead to public embarrassment.

In the United States, climate change is polarizing, but one environmental challenge draws rare bipartisan agreement: food waste.

Even as the Trump administration rolls back key climate and environmental protections, in July, senators from both parties reintroduced legislation to simplify food expiration labels — one longtime driver of unnecessary waste. In September, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched a national initiative to connect food donors with communities and keep edible food out of landfills. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. unveiled a national strategy to reduce food waste and expand recycling of organic waste.

Despite this rare consensus, progress has been slow, Floodlight and Sentient report.

In 2023, the U.S. still squandered roughly a third of its food supply, according to the food waste nonprofit ReFED. Food waste is responsible for 8-10% of all global emissions — about five times the emissions from the entire aviation industry. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that if food waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the U.S.

Experts tell Sentient that the problem persists because political follow-through is limited, climate action still focuses heavily on energy and transportation, and ultimately, food waste itself is difficult to tackle. It occurs at every stage of the supply chain, from farms to fridges, making comprehensive action essential.

It’s also a missed opportunity, especially since wasting food is widely seen as wrong.

“Nobody wakes up wanting to waste food,” said Dana Gunders, president of ReFED, during a summit at New York City Climate Week in September 2025.

Many people don’t realize that food waste reduction is a crucial and often overlooked climate strategy. Addressing food loss and waste has enormous climate potential, “but it’s still an underexplored area,” says Brian Lipinski, head researcher on food loss and waste at the environmental research nonprofit World Resources Institute.

‍

The climate cost of wasted food

Most food waste happens in homes, restaurants, and retailers, but nearly all of its climate impact is already baked in by the time the food is thrown away. Every piece of wasted food squanders all the emissions that went into producing and transporting that food.

About 92% of food waste emissions happen during food production — when land is converted from forests or grassland to farmland, when resources are used to grow crops or raise livestock, during transport, in which most vehicles run on diesel or gasoline, and during cold storage. Once that food is tossed, those emissions are wasted. Only 8% of food waste emissions come from the disposal process.

When people are wasting food, “in many ways, we are throwing out a lot of water, a lot of land, a lot of fertilizer, natural habitat, a lot of things,” Paul West, a senior scientist at the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, tells Sentient.

Fruits and vegetables make up almost half — 44% — of all U.S. food waste, according to ReFED. Meat and seafood, though also quick to spoil, are wasted less often because they are more expensive.

But wasting even a small portion of a burger has far greater environmental impact than wasting the same amount of fruits, vegetables, or chicken, says West. That’s because producing beef requires vast amounts of land, water, and fertilizer; and cattle also release methane — a short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas — with each cow burping about 220 pounds annually.

“If we are going to eat beef and dairy, make sure not to waste it,” says West.

‍

Why prevention matters most

Experts see reducing food loss and waste as one of the most impactful and practical ways to slow the warming of the planet. Project Drawdown calls it an “emergency brake” solution — a measure that can rapidly slash emissions using tools we already have, without waiting for new technologies or nature-based fixes. Other such measures include halting deforestation and shifting away from meat and dairy.

“Preventing food from becoming waste is really the most effective solution, not only from an emissions perspective,” says Minerva Ringland, senior manager of the climate and insights team at ReFED, “but it’s also saving the most money and keeping everyone fed as much as possible.”

In the United States, 35% of food waste comes from households, while 18% comes from manufacturing, 17% from food service, and 24% happens on farms. Household waste is high because people often buy more than what they need, especially in bulk, misinterpret date labels, prepare too much food, and may not know how to store or repurpose ingredients. Limited access to composting programs also makes it harder for consumers to avoid landfills.

Experts suggest households can curb waste by planning meals, buying only what’s needed, using smaller portions, and repurposing leftovers.

Emily Broad Leib, director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic, says the U.S. needs a national consumer awareness campaign, similar to the United Kingdom’s Love Food, Hate Waste campaign. She notes that the Biden administration set aside funding to develop such a campaign, but it has since stalled. Many people don’t realize how significant the issue of food waste is, she says — not just for the environment but for their own finances.

But reducing food waste at home is not just about telling people to be more careful or intentional about their purchases. After all, food waste is rarely intentional. Maybe you buy an ingredient for one recipe and never use the rest, or forget the leftovers in your fridge and they go bad. Lipinski says that retailers and food service providers can help consumers avoid waste by offering smaller portions, clearer guidance, and smarter packaging.

Government agencies can lead by example in reducing food waste in their dining halls, federal buildings, schools, and military bases by requiring vendors to donate surplus food, Broad Leib suggests.

These strategies are worth the effort because preventing food waste at its source offers climate benefits about 10 times higher than other strategies since it reduces the need for producing additional food.

Beyond prevention, the EPA identifies donation and upcycling — turning food into new products — as the most preferred approaches. However, 40% of donated food still goes to waste, and both strategies require energy for transport, storage, and processing.

According to the EPA, using wasted food as animal feed, leaving crops unharvested, composting, and anaerobic digestion do much less to offset the environmental impacts of food production than preventing food waste in the first place.

‍

Where most wasted food ends up

Most of the country’s surplus food still ends up in landfills, compost facilities, incinerators, or anaerobic digesters, according to ReFED. Only about 2% is donated. Food makes up nearly a quarter of combusted municipal solid waste that ends up in landfills.

In landfills, food waste decays and releases methane, a gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a 20-year period. Landfills produce 17% of human-related methane emissions in the U.S., after oil and gas and livestock digestion. A majority of the methane released from landfills in the U.S. comes from food waste, according to the EPA. A separate analysis by ReFED estimates that surplus food generates nearly 3 million metric tons of methane each year.

Improving landfill management is one of Project Drawdown’s highly recommended climate solutions. To capture or reduce methane emissions, some landfills install systems that divert landfill gas so that it can be burned for energy and sold to industries or utilities, helping replace fossil fuels. Methane that cannot be used for energy is typically burned off using flares.

Another approach uses biocovers — layers of organic material that foster bacteria that convert methane into carbon dioxide and water. Leak detection and repair programs can monitor methane leaks using drones, satellites, or on-site sensors, which helps operators spot and fix leaks.

Encouraging composting instead of putting food scraps in landfills also helps. But West says that while composting and landfill management matter, “you’ll have many times more impact if you stop the waste in the first place.”

‍

A change to these policies could help curb food waste

For something so uncontroversial, food waste has proven remarkably hard to fix.

In 2015, the U.S. set an ambitious goal of halving food loss and waste by 2030 — a target experts say is quickly becoming out of reach. No state is on track to meet the target, researchers from ReFED and University of California Davis found in an analysis published in January.

They warned that food waste levels are unlikely to fall without stronger state and federal action focused on prevention measures such as standardized date labeling, food rescue, and repurposing. Current policies, they noted, focus too narrowly on recycling methods like composting rather than addressing the problem across the entire food system.

Standardized date labeling is one of the most cost-effective fixes, ReFED argues. In the U.S., 6% of all food waste is due to confusion over date labels. Many U.S. consumers don’t know the specifics, but there is no national standard for date labels. Some products have “Sell by” dates, others have “Best before” dates, and still others have “Use by” dates — and they often mean different things in different states. The dates on packaging are “not designed for consumers to understand clearly,” Ringwald says.

As a result, many people toss food after the printed date, assuming it is unsafe to eat. This confusion leads Americans to discard about 3 billion pounds of perfectly fine food worth $7 billion each year. “Sell by,” “Best before,” and “Use by” dates usually indicate how long a product will stay at peak quality, not whether it is still safe to eat.

According to the USDA, the “Best if used by” or “Best before” date shows when the product will taste or look its best. “Sell by” indicates how long a store should keep a product on the shelf, and is meant for communication between manufacturers and retailers, but is often mistaken by consumers for an expiration date.“Use by” is the last date the product is at its best quality.

If you have a can of beans in your cupboard with a “Sell by,” “Use by,” or “Best before” date, it does not necessarily mean you should throw it out once that date passes. ReFED says that many foods, such as canned goods, nuts, and dry packaged goods can remain edible past the printed date.

To address this, ReFED advocates for a two-label system: “Best if used by” and “Use by.” “Best if used by” indicates product quality: it may not taste its best, but it is still safe to consume. This label is recommended for use for canned goods, bread, raw meats, frozen foods, and pasteurized products.

Meanwhile, “Use by” would apply to highly perishable items or those that pose a risk to safety over time, like deli meats, unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses, and smoked seafood. These products should be eaten by the date on the package and tossed afterward.

If passed, the bill reintroduced in the Senate would make that standard nationwide. Similar measures have been introduced in the past, but have not advanced. ReFED estimates that standardizing labels could keep at least 425,000 tons of food — or 708 million meals — out of landfills each year.

“Even though the issue is something that both Republican and Democratic administrations have cared about and worked on, there’s a lot of momentum that gets lost in between administrations,” Broad Leib says. The lack of sustained policies, she adds, has prevented the U.S. from making meaningful progress in reducing food waste.

‍

‘Pockets of progress’

Still, there are signs of progress, especially at the state level. That’s probably where we’ll see more momentum under the Trump administration, says Lipinski.

In 2024, California signed the country’s first legislation to adopt a clear two-label system on food products. Starting July 1, 2026, the law will also ban the use of “Sell by” dates.

Another is the implementation of state-level mandates that prohibit sending commercial food waste to landfills. States including California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Massachusetts have enacted such bans.

However, a study published last year found these policies have largely fallen short — except in Massachusetts, which succeeded in reducing the amount of food waste sent to landfills by 13%. Researchers found that Massachusetts has the country’s most extensive food waste composting network, making it easy and low-cost for businesses and households to follow the ban. The state’s rules are straightforward, with no exemptions, and authorities conduct far more inspections and issue more fines for violations than in other states. These differences point the way toward better implementation in other states.

Experts say that stronger incentives for grocers and restaurants to donate food could also make a significant difference. Some states, like California, now require some commercial establishments to donate edible food that they would otherwise throw out.

“We’re seeing pockets of progress everywhere,” says Ringwald. Because food waste is a complex problem, she adds, “We’re going to need a lot of solutions.” The key is turning these scattered successes into coordinated and sustained action across the supply chain, which can save money, slash emissions, and put food on tables.

China’s BYD ousted Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, marking the first time it surpassed the Elon Musk-led automaker in annual sales.

In 2025, BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla, which sold 1.64 million cars last year, representing a 9% decline from a year earlier, the Associated Press reported.

The New York Times reported that a growing number of those car sales happened outside China, mainly in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Chinese electric vehicles are effectively banned from the United States by high tariffs.

What is BYD?

The backstory:

BYD Auto was founded in 2003 and is an automotive subsidiary of BYD, a multinational high-tech company focused on leveraging technological innovations. According to the company’s website, BYD Auto develops pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The organization noted on its website that it’s the world's first automaker to halt the production of fossil-fueled cars on the electric vehicle shift and has remained top of new energy passenger vehicle sales in China for 10 years in a row.

How much do BYD electric vehicles cost?

By the numbers:

BYD manufactures different electric vehicles like the BYD Dolphin and the HAN, which is displayed on the company's website, although the price isn’t listed.

But in August 2025, BYD introduced the Atto 1 at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show, which is priced around $12,000, FOX News reported.

And there’s also the BYD Seagull, which costs $8,000, and it’s the company’s best-selling EV, Inside EVs reported.

Amid those uncertainties, my priorities remain the same: continuing America’s national defense rebuild and advocating for Mississippi’s growth.
The law is most famous for its tax cuts, but it contains major national defense provisions.
In December, Congress passed, and the president signed, the National Defense Authorization Act.
These efforts were necessary first steps to kick-start our military rebuild.","Over the past few weeks, I have looked back, remarking on the good news coming out of Mississippi. As we turn the page on 2025, I am looking toward the future. The U.S. Senate is poised to have a busy 2026. This will be the final year of the 119th Congress, and we will debate legislation regarding housing, healthcare, national defense, and more.

The midterm elections in November will determine whether Republicans maintain a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Amid those uncertainties, my priorities remain the same: continuing America’s national defense rebuild and advocating for Mississippi’s growth.

We can look back on 2025 as a watershed year in the modernization of the U.S. military. Congress passed two major national security laws that will change the course of our defensive capabilities. As the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I led the process for both pieces of legislation.

On July 4th, President Trump signed the Working Families Tax Cuts. The law is most famous for its tax cuts, but it contains major national defense provisions. The legislation made a downpayment on numerous weapons systems. In December, Congress passed, and the president signed, the National Defense Authorization Act. We built on the investments of the summer and reformed the Pentagon’s process for acquiring ships, aircraft, and weapons.

These efforts were necessary first steps to kick-start our military rebuild. In 2026, I plan to pass the next phase of defense investments and to implement the acquisition reforms that will make this rebuild possible. The tyrants in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea will take any American weakness as an invitation to be aggressive. We must achieve the kind of military strength that can deter these foes from moving against us.

I am working to protect our nation from threats abroad so that we can enjoy peace and prosperity at home. As always, I will advocate for legislation that helps Mississippi stay competitive in today’s economy.

Companies are already choosing to relocate to Mississippi, drawn by our business-friendly laws, low cost of living, and family values environment. I will keep doing what I can to make our state even more attractive. Across the state, I am working with local officials to improve transportation networks, water systems, and energy capabilities. In December, I introduced a bill called the Success for BEAD Act, which would help more Mississippians receive internet connectivity. I will continue pushing for greater access to telehealth and other policies that benefit rural communities.

In 2026, we will all pause to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our country’s founding. As we commemorate this milestone, Americans face rising threats abroad, division at home, and fears for the future. Dictators are working to upset the global balance of power, raising questions about the United States’ role in the world. Families, churches, and communities wrestle with disagreements. Parents worry about the effect artificial intelligence will have on their children’s education and job prospects.

Looking back on our history can provide both comfort and guidance. Our Founding Fathers set up a system of government so ingenious that it withstood centuries of change. The story of our country is one of resilience. Government by the people, the separation of powers, and the rule of law have guided us this far. I am confident they will carry us ahead into the next 250 years.",https://picayuneitem.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/09/column-wicker.jpg?w=750,N,,2026-01-02 15:13:29.333625

The tally raises questions about whether Tesla can stabilize its core auto business following two consecutive years of sales declines, even as it pivots to futuristic projects such as robotics and self-driving cars to justify its steep valuation.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October–December quarter, down 15.6 percent from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 percent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company's second consecutive annual decline.

Shares were up 1.9 percent in trading before the bell.

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in U.S. EV tax credits before they expired at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off.

EV demand has softened across the industry since the end of September, when the Trump administration ended US$7,500 (HK$58,500) federal tax credits, with Tesla also facing rising competition globally.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 percent from 2024. The company has said it aims to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about US$5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend volumes after the tax credit loss.

Analysts have said Tesla came under immense pressure in 2025 in North America and Europe, where competition intensified and the company faced brand backlash due to Musk's political rhetoric.

Even as vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4 percent in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It's a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world's richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much-reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was down nearly 2% at $441.15 in early afternoon trading Friday.

RELATED STORY | Musk could become history's first trillionaire as Tesla shareholders approve giant pay package

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business. He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin earlier this year, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We're dealing with people's lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla's autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world's first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54a661e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4536+0+839/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F84%2Fa1%2Fac326cd0456bb7298a62f758fa0d%2Fap25286564456046.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:59:11.917879

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk, who once dismissed BYD as a threat. Tesla’s rise had seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make Musk the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

With global EV sales rising 28 percent last year, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe, where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival.

Tesla, whose sales fell about 8.6 percent in 2025, is facing intense competition, especially in Europe, raising questions about its ability to revive ‍the core auto business as CEO Elon Musk steers the company towards robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Shares of the company fell about 2 percent in afternoon trading.

""Investors are so focused on the future with Tesla that they are ignoring delivery numbers. It's about Optimus, Robotaxi and physical AI,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, which owns Tesla shares.

End of tax credit in U.S. pinches Tesla

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $7,500 in ‍federal tax credits after President Donald Trump's administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.

In the ‍U.S., EVs accounted for 6.2 percent of retail vehicle sales in the quarter, down 3.6 percentage points from a year earlier, while ‌average transaction prices rose nearly $6,000 to $53,300, according to J.D. Power data.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down ‍15.6 percent from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles, or a 12.3 percent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by ‌Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles.

The decline in deliveries was not a major surprise, given the market had already priced in weaker demand after U.S. EV tax credits ended, said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

Meanwhile, Tesla said it deployed 14.2 GWh of energy storage products, a record high. It is set to ‍report fourth-quarter results on January 28.

Intensifying competition in North America and Europe

Growing competition from Chinese and European automakers such as BYD, Volkswagen and BMW has ‍weighed on Tesla's sales momentum.

Tesla registrations declined across much of Europe in December but jumped in Norway, where record sales contrasted with shrinking market share in rest of the region in 2025.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 percent from 2024. The company has said it aimed to ‍sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the ⁠tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

Tech companies invested hundreds of billions of dollars this past year in data centers, which use enormous amounts of electricity. Planet Money's Keith Romer explains the connection to consumer power bills.

KEITH ROMER, BYLINE: Electricity prices have been going up for a lot of Americans, including a retired couple in Granville, Ohio - Ken and Carol Apacki.

(SOUNDBITE OF TYPING ON KEYBOARD)

ROMER: Every month for the last five years...

KEN APACKI: And here's my spreadsheet.

ROMER: ...Ken has recorded every charge on his electric bills.

K APACKI: And so here we start back in July of 2020.

ROMER: In 2020, they paid between 11 and 12 cents per kilowatt hour for power.

K APACKI: And down here in 2025, it's 19.

ROMER: Up 60%. Ken's wife, Carol, suspects the price jump has to do with some new construction nearby.

CAROL APACKI: A hundred and thirty data centers in Central Ohio here. I mean, that is amazing.

ROMER: Let's break down how these data centers could be raising their bills. There are three basic components to an electric bill. The first is distribution. Think the local power lines that bring electricity the last mile to your home. Marc Reitter runs the Apackis' local utility company, AEP Ohio.

MARC REITTER: The grid supports everybody. It's almost a universal service.

ROMER: That grid has to be expanded to bring lots of power to data centers. But the way the electricity system is set up, it's not just data centers that pay for that expansion. It's everyone.

REITTER: And everybody pays fair share. That's the crux of the model - has been for a long time.

ROMER: Reitter's company recently designed new rules to make data centers pay for more of that expansion. But those rules don't extend to the next component of the Apackis' bill - transmission. Think the high-voltage power lines that bring power from far away to your town. The Apackis' transmission company is spending billions of dollars building out its grid for data centers, costs which filter down to residential customers. Still, more than half of the Apackis' increased electricity prices come not from distribution and not from transmission, but from the third component of their bill - generation. Think the power plants that make electricity.

Cathy Kunkel works for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank focused on sustainable energy. She says in the region where Ken and Carol Apacki live, prices for generation have gone way up, in part because of data centers' insatiable hunger for electricity.

CATHY KUNKEL: The demand is there, and the supply is maybe not.

ROMER: And those high prices? They are also being shared, even though a lot of that price increase was a result of the new data centers tech companies are building.

KUNKEL: I think it's almost inevitable, the way that these structures are set up, that ordinary people are going to end up subsidizing the wealthiest industry in the world.

ROMER: Unless, Kunkel says, we reform the rules so that more of the costs of expanding electricity infrastructure are paid by the data centers themselves.

A family huddled over the kitchen table, staring at their electric bill. Chalkboard signs in a coffee shop bemoaning Connecticut’s high energy costs. The incumbent Democratic governor promising to open new power plants, even if it means expanding natural gas.

As issues of affordability take center stage in this year’s midterm elections, Connecticut’s nagging struggle with high electricity bills is making its way to the top of early messaging in the state’s budding 2026 gubernatorial race.

Politicians and voters in Connecticut are no strangers to frustrations over their utility bills and the vexing efforts to lower them. For years, and across several election cycles, the state has ranked near the top in the nation for the highest average cost of electricity.

But with electricity prices nationally now rising faster than inflation, candidates in other states have begun to tackle the issue in ways that serve as a prelude to this year’s races.

In a handful of recent elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, for example, Democrats outperformed expectations by running on keeping utility rate hikes in check and raising warnings about the proliferation of power-guzzling AI data centers. The party’s earlier focus on adopting renewable, carbon-free power has given way to promoting the development of new nuclear reactors — and even natural gas — as a way of meeting rising demand without harming voters’ pocketbooks.

The shift in attention toward energy prices was evident at the 2025 national convention of state utility regulators in Seattle, according to Elin Swanson Katz, who previously led Connecticut’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of utility customers. Katz, who now works as a consultant on energy issues, said the convention schedule was packed with panels discussing the trends that are driving up prices, as well as ways to maintain affordability while making investments in grid infrastructure and new sources of electricity.

“As someone who has spent my career largely as a consumer advocate and somebody who thinks about public engagement, it was a real sea change, something that I think we should have been talking about all along,” Katz said. “There’s no doubt, based on national polling, that consumers — customers — want affordable energy, but they also want investments in renewable so, I mean, there’s definitely tension on that.”

In April, a poll conducted by Ipsos and the consumer nonprofit PowerLines found that nearly three-quarters of Americans were concerned about rising energy costs, and nearly 60% said they felt their state governments were not doing enough to protect ratepayers.

Already, efforts have been made over the last year to address Connecticut’s energy costs. The results have been mixed.

In June, Gov. Ned Lamont — who is seeking a third term — signed legislation promising to save customers roughly $100 a year on their electric bills, mostly by borrowing money to offset portions of what’s known as the public benefits charge on customer bills.

Those savings were quickly dissipated, however, by a new rate hike for United Illuminating customers and the announcement of higher winter supply rates.

The legislature’s efforts were also largely overshadowed by a clash between utility companies and their regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that resulted in the agency’s leader, Marissa Gillett, stepping down in October. While Gillett had been hailed by some, including Lamont, as a champion of consumers, critics accused her of skirting laws to exert control over the agency — a charge that was largely upheld in court.

At the same time, President Donald Trump’s efforts to steer federal energy policy in the direction of more fossil fuels has upended long-term investments that states like Connecticut have already made in pursuing cleaner forms of electricity such as solar and wind.

Noah Kaufman, an economist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, published a paper in November citing rising electric prices as an obstacle to Connecticut’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions. A lack of local fuel resources combined with high delivery costs and certain clean-energy programs all contributed to the state’s high cost of electricity, the paper found.

In an interview, Kaufman said candidates here may have to adjust their pitches to appeal to voters who are concerned about both costs and the climate.

“We have very ambitious decarbonization targets without an obvious plan for how to achieve them at this point,” Kaufman said. “Politicians may have to consider strategies that would have been off the table a few years ago — might not have seemed politically viable — because any sort of reforms are going to go up against constituencies that like the policies in place now.”

Recent elections elsewhere

Historically, electricity prices have tended to take a backseat to other pocketbook issues, such as taxes and gas prices, in political campaigns. That has changed as electricity prices have risen faster than inflation, on average, since 2022.

In New Jersey, one of two states that held gubernatorial elections in November, summer electric rates were up 22% compared to the previous year.

“The No. 1, 2 and 3 issues in our race was Trump,” said Matthew Hale, an expert on New Jersey politics and professor at Seton Hall University. “But four, five and six were all affordability, and so energy was certainly a big deal,” he said.

“Energy costs are something people see every single day. When they jump right in the middle of a campaign, it’s a big issue,” Hale said.

The winner of that race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, promised to freeze electric rates during her first year in office, though experts as well as New Jersey’s regulated utility companies questioned her ability to do so. She also criticized the state’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, for approving rate hikes as well as the Trump administration for scrapping federal support for solar panels and energy efficiency programs.

At the same time, Sherrill faced a barrage of attack ads from her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, that used selectively-edited footage of Sherrill appearing to say that voters should support renewable energy programs even if it costs them “an arm and a leg.” Sherrill was actually critiquing how other Democrats had spoken about such issues.

Hale said that Sherrill neutralized those attacks by talking about modernizing natural gas infrastructure and building new nuclear power reactors as part of her energy platform, in addition to her support for renewable energy.

“She didn’t lean into the environmentalists’ wing,” Hale said. “She just sort of said, ‘We need to do better.’ She didn’t back the idea that it was going to be nothing but renewables.”

In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her own affordability plan that focused on developing more generation from offshore wind, solar panels and small modular reactors — in addition to energy efficiency programs — as a way to bring down bills.

Spanberger also warned that the proliferation of data centers in Virginia was pushing the state toward an “energy crisis.” Her plan called for data center owners to pay their share of the cost to build the new power plants and transmission lines needed to power the facilities.

The Republican in that race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, said in interviews that Virginia’s data centers were “here to stay” and that she supported an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that included older, dirtier forms of generation such as coal.

Both Spanberger and Sherrill won their respective states by healthy margins.

The 2025 elections also saw Democrats in Georgia flip two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility companies. The winning candidates in those races focused on recent price hikes and the need to transition away from fossil fuels.

Still, experts caution that elected officials generally have a limited ability to actually lower the price of electricity.

That’s because a large percentage of customers’ bills go to pay for things like the maintenance of the transmission and distribution system, which is also growing more expensive. In many states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, utilities purchase electricity from power plants, then sell that power to customers without any markup. While elected officials may appoint regulators to approve utility rates — in Connecticut, appointments to PURA are made by the governor — those regulators are typically expected to approve justifiable costs.

“Politicians make those decisions, and it’s going to affect things a little bit, but that’s not going to fundamentally fix the fact that Connecticut has really high energy prices,” said Erik Katovich, a professor of energy and resource economics at the University of Connecticut.

Katz, the former Connecticut consumer counsel, echoed that sentiment saying candidates such as Sherrill and Spanberger now face the tough task of formulating policies that will fulfill their promises to voters.

“I don’t think there’s any really fully developed policy in any of these states, because it’s really, really hard to do,” Katz said. “If there were simple answers we would have done it already. But, I do feel encouraged that so many smart, skilled, experienced professionals are now recognizing that affordability should be in the top two issues that we address around our electric system.”

What Connecticut candidates are saying

Since taking office seven years ago, Lamont has signed numerous climate-related measures, including a 2022 law that promised to eliminate greenhouse gases from the electricity supplied to Connecticut customers by 2040.

But with the cost of utility bills proving a perennial issue throughout his tenure, the centrist Democrat has been wary of pursuing a more immediate decarbonization agenda sought by many environmental advocates and those on the Left.

In a recent interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Lamont said that his is an “all-the-above” energy strategy that includes support for renewable such as solar and wind along with natural gas and the nuclear power supplied by the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford.

“In most cases, a lot of the renewables are also part of our long term solution to hold down costs,” Lamont said. “Natural gas — which I’ve been talking to our neighboring states and the White House about how it can replace some of the liquefied natural gas with more piped-in natural gas — that would be a lot less expensive and always on as well.”

Early last year, Lamont met with Trump administration officials in Washington, D.C., to discuss an expansion of pipelines that could deliver more natural gas into Connecticut and the rest of New England. In August, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection signaled its intent to approve a pair of compressor stations in Brookfield, expanding the capacity of the existing Iroquois Pipeline.

And while Lamont was an early backer of efforts to grow New England’s offshore wind industry, his administration has opted against buying into any new projects with the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, citing the rising costs of wind power.

Now, the governor faces challenges from both sides of the aisle over the cost of electricity and his commitment to the climate.

On the Republican side, state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart have both launched campaigns that zero in on the state’s high cost of electricity.

(Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, is also reportedly mulling a run for governor but has yet to formally launch a campaign. Appearing on Newsmax in late December, she criticized offshore wind projects supported by Connecticut and other New England states.)

Fazio, who serves as the ranking Republican on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, has been one of the leading voices among lawmakers in favor of eliminating — or at least sharply reducing — the public benefits charge that pays for things such as energy efficiency programs, financial aid and investments in renewable energy that have been mandated by state lawmakers.

Fazio also criticized the costs of some of the renewable investments supported by customers as “obscenely expensive.”

“I think the evidence is there that it’s important to Connecticut residents and voters who are becoming increasingly wise to the fact that it’s actually elected officials in the state government who have been inflating the cost of the public benefits charge and electricity rates in general,” Fazio said.

During the 2025 legislative session, Fazio proposed shifting the cost of the public benefits charge — currently around $1 billion a year — onto the state’s budget. When that effort failed to gain traction, Fazio worked with Democratic leaders and Lamont’s office on a compromise measure, Senate Bill 4, that ultimately passed with bipartisan support. The bill authorized officials to borrow up to $250 million over two years to pay off some of the public benefits charge.

Moving forward, Fazio said lawmakers should examine each of the programs in the public benefits charge to determine whether they should remain a charge to customers, be covered in the state budget or be ended entirely. That would include making decisions over whether to provide public funding for certain programs, such as the low-income discount rate, that are intended to help some customers pay their bills.

“Should we have more of this program, less of this program? That’s, I think, a conversation for the appropriations process,” Fazio said. “On its face, it is not something you just shove in the electricity bill.”

Stewart’s campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview on energy policy. In April, then-Mayor Stewart posted on X that she attended a signing ceremony for Trump’s executive order supporting the coal industry, where she said she met with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and talked about the state’s “affordable energy future.” Connecticut’s last coal plant, Bridgeport Harbor Station, closed down in 2021 and was partially demolished last year.

In another social media post, Stewart also criticized the bipartisan effort to borrow money to reduce the public benefits charge as “fake relief” because that money would have to be paid back, with interest, by taxpayers. She also called for an end to the public benefits charge and an increase in energy supply, without going into details.

While Lamont supported the bonds included in S.B. 4, he expressed skepticism of proposals for the state to pick up more of the public benefits tab, saying it would merely move around costs without achieving savings.

“Ratepayers and taxpayers are the same people,” Lamont said. “What you’ve really got to do is generate more electricity that will reduce the great spikes … that’s what really drives the cost.”

Lamont is also facing a primary challenge from state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a self-described progressive who has said he wants to push Democrats to adopt more left-wing stances.

“The governor wants to be seen as progressive, so he wants the top line to be ‘historic investment in renewable energy,’ and then at his very next breath, he says ‘historic investment in natural gas,’” Elliott said.

If elected, Elliott said that he would seek to finance the cost of building solar and other renewable energy projects through state bonds that are paid back by taxpayers instead of being tacked onto customers’ electric bills. He also said he would take a tougher approach toward the development of data centers than either Lamont or Fazio — both of whom said they would support such projects if the developers agreed to pay their share of the cost to build the electric infrastructure needed to run them.

Elliott said any power plants built for data centers should have to run off of renewable electricity, not natural gas or petroleum. He also questioned the economic benefit of large data centers, noting that they tend to employ relatively few people outside of the construction workers it takes to build them.

“What looks like a boon to our economy ends up being something that, over the long run, is a really bad decision,” Elliott said.

Lori Brown, executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, criticized both Lamont and Republicans for embracing natural gas, which she pointed out is subject to volatile price spikes that can increase the cost of energy, particularly in the winter.

“In Connecticut, the narrative is just being driven as if clean energy is the reason for all the woes in in electric bills,” Brown said. “That’s just such a false narrative.”

Additionally, Brown and other environmental advocates argue that investing in clean energy helps avoid other long-term costs associated with climate change, such as damage from storms and health care costs for people with respiratory illnesses.

Both CTLCV and the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club endorsed Lamont during each of his previous two runs for governor. The split over the issue of gas pipeline expansions, however, could push those groups to withhold their endorsements or consider backing Elliott in the primary.

Steve Lewis, the chair of the Connecticut Sierra Club’s political committee, said the group has yet to meet to discuss endorsements but said the pipeline issue is “something we need to consider very seriously.”

In response, Lamont pointed to his administration’s support for solar and wind projects, as well as efforts to improve energy efficiency. He added that any projects to expand pipeline capacity would be subject to the “highest environmental standards,” and compared against other energy resources to determine which have the lowest costs.

“You’re not serious about affordability if you’re not serious about an all-the-above strategy,” Lamont said.

Federal impact

In addition to their Connecticut-specific pitches, each of the the candidates for governor must also navigate the seismic — and at times unpredictable — shifts in federal energy policy being introduced by the Trump administration.

In October, the Trump administration ordered a sudden halt to work on a massive offshore wind farm, Revolution Wind, off the coast of Rhode Island. At the time, the project was nearly 80% completed and employed more than 100 workers at the State Pier in New London.

The move drew swift criticism from Lamont and other proponents of offshore wind, who predicted that the loss of Revolution Wind would increase the risk of blackouts while pushing additional supply costs onto electric customers. Eventually, a lawsuit by the project’s developer succeeded in getting work to resume.

Then, three days before Christmas, the Trump administration again ordered a pause for Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects under development.

Even Republicans such as Fazio and Stewart expressed some unease over Trump’s intervention in Revolution Wind, despite their criticisms of wind power.

“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish,” Stewart said in an interview with CT Mirror in December, prior to the administration’s second effort to halt the project.

Fazio has criticized the cost of the power purchase agreement Connecticut entered into with Revolution Wind’s developers, which he said is likely to result in additional charges on customers’ monthly electric bills.

“On the other end, you know, the project is down the path,” Fazio said. “There’s a tradeoff there and I hope that the concerns that the federal government has, that the state and feds can communicate about [them] and work [them] out.”

Trump has also complicated ongoing efforts in Connecticut to utilize federal money to spur investments in climate-friendly programs. As part of a wide-ranging tax and spending bill passed last year, the federal government began phasing out tax incentives and other subsidies for electric vehicles, solar panels and energy efficiency upgrades that had been a centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s energy policy.

“It’s huge,” said Kaufman, the Columbia professor. “The whole premise of [Biden’s] Inflation Reduction Act and the subsidies for clean energy within that law was that the federal government was going to pick up the tab for a lot of investments in clean energy, or energy efficiency, or conservation actions.”

While the Trump administration and Congress have continued to support some investments in low- and zero-emission technologies, particularly nuclear, Kaufman said the changes in federal policy will generally force state officials to choose between picking up the cost of clean energy programs or discontinuing them.

“To keep moving forward, that means more of those costs are going to going to have to be incurred by Connecticut ratepayers and residents,” he added. “That’s a big deal… we’re just in a very different situation here than we were a few years ago.”

In Connecticut, Kaufman said officials could also look to trim some of the costs of clean energy programs — such as subsidies for rooftop solar or tradable credits for renewable energy — without imperiling the broader public push to adopt those technologies.

Last February, Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian energy imports, sparking confusion as to whether they would apply to electricity crossing the U.S.-Canadian border on transmission lines. New England imports about 11% of its electricity from Canada.

A spokesperson for the regional grid operator, ISO New England, said in an email that the federal government has yet to levy tariffs on those imports, and that the additional duties announced by the administration are not believed to apply to electricity.

Meanwhile, the president’s promises to lower electricity costs by keeping open aging coal power plants is unlikely to have much of an impact in New England, where the only operating coal plant shut down in September.

Its objective is to demonstrate that wave energy can progress from demonstration projects to commercial-scale deployment and become part of the mainstream renewable energy sector.
The POWER-Farm EU consortium includes European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), University of Edinburgh, Ocean Energy Europe, Renewable Risk Advisers, and Kristinehamn Teknik & Service.
The partners will test wave energy systems at EMEC’s site in Scotland to demonstrate survivability, reliability, and performance at farm scale.

The project will validate wave energy technology under conditions required for large-scale deployment in UK waters.

The project is supported by €19m in funding from Horizon Europe. Its objective is to demonstrate that wave energy can progress from demonstration projects to commercial-scale deployment and become part of the mainstream renewable energy sector.

The POWER-Farm EU consortium includes European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), University of Edinburgh, Ocean Energy Europe, Renewable Risk Advisers, and Kristinehamn Teknik & Service.

The partners will test wave energy systems at EMEC’s site in Scotland to demonstrate survivability, reliability, and performance at farm scale. The UK is estimated to have up to 25GW of practical wave energy deployment potential, with Scotland hosting some of the world’s strongest wave resources. The project supports CorPower Ocean’s plans for global deployment while strengthening the UK’s role as a key early market.

According to research from the Supergen ORE Hub and the Policy and Innovation Group at the University of Edinburgh, wave energy could generate more than £30bn in gross value added for the UK economy under a high-ambition scenario. Combined with tidal stream energy, which could contribute more than £20 billion, the sector could support over 80,000 jobs if a strong domestic supply chain is developed.

The project builds on CorPower Ocean’s wave energy converter technology currently deployed off the coast of Portugal. It also focuses on proving that a European, and particularly UK and Scottish, supply chain can support larger commercial wave energy farms through volume manufacturing.

Anders Jansson, Head of Business Development at CorPower Ocean, said:

“The POWER-Farm EU initiative arrives at a pivotal moment for the wave-energy sector, as the industry shifts from research and development to commercial deployments,” said Anders Jansson, Head of Business Development at CorPower Ocean. “With Europe investing to bring wave energy to farm-scale readiness, we urge the UK to match this ambition and unlock its vast wave-energy potential. The UK is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in this emerging frontier, establishing a major new sector driving economic growth and job creation. With the right support and a clear route to market, developers and investors will have the certainty they need to deliver the nation’s first commercial wave-energy arrays, while ensuring the UK can capitalize on this golden opportunity.”

Wave energy is increasingly viewed as a strategic technology for providing clean, firm power that complements wind and solar generation. Across Europe, policy momentum continues to build. The UK has recently launched a Marine Energy Taskforce led by Energy Minister Michael Shanks, with support from The Crown Estate and Crown Estate Scotland. The taskforce is developing a roadmap covering site development, financing, innovation, and supply chain growth.

Guillaume Unique, Project Manager at CorPower Ocean and for POWER-Farm EU, said: “We are thrilled to deepen our collaboration with the partners in this ground-breaking project. Together, we bring a unique blend of cutting-edge research, advanced manufacturing capabilities, world-class testing infrastructure, and proven bankability expertise creating a powerful foundation for success.”

Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe, added: “The POWER-Farm EU project is a key milestone for Europe’s wave energy sector. Demonstrating scalable and reliable wave energy technology will help unlock investment, industrialisation, and the wider deployment of ocean energy. Initiatives built on strong partnerships and EU support are critical for achieving Europe’s climate and energy targets while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in the sector.”

Wave energy’s more consistent production profile can help stabilise power systems with high shares of wind and solar. Studies indicate that systems including wave energy may require significantly less installed capacity, grid infrastructure, and storage than systems based only on variable renewables.

Global accessible wave energy potential is estimated at more than 500 GW. For the UK and Scotland, the POWER-Farm EU project is intended to position wave energy as a commercial technology while supporting long-term economic development and energy security.",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/01/CorPower-Power-FARM-EU.png,N,,2026-01-02 14:59:37.646816

This reduces data center emissions intensity, building on Alphabet’s 12% Scope 2 cut in 2024 despite surging demand.","Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has agreed to buy Intersect, a U.S. clean energy developer, in a deal valued at $4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt. The transaction was announced in December 2025 and is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

The acquisition helps Alphabet gain more strength for its growing data center operations. It also supports the growth of its artificial intelligence (AI) services.

The deal includes Intersect’s team, energy projects under development, and data center infrastructure. Intersect will keep running independently with its current leaders. It will also collaborate closely with Alphabet’s technical teams.

Why AI Growth Is Forcing Alphabet to Secure Its Own Power

Alphabet runs one of the world’s largest cloud and AI businesses. These services need huge amounts of electricity. AI applications, such as large language models and cloud computing tools, require powerful data centers.

The electricity demand from these centers is growing fast. Many power grids struggle to keep up with this demand. That makes reliable and clean power especially important for companies like Alphabet.

By buying Intersect, Alphabet can gain more control over the supply of electricity for its data centers. The clean energy projects Intersect develops include solar power, battery storage, and other generation capacity. Owning these assets lets Alphabet bring new power online faster. It also reduces reliance on outside energy suppliers.

Alphabet has already worked with Intersect. Google took a minority stake in Intersect in 2024 and partnered on several projects before the acquisition. The full purchase builds on that existing relationship.

SEE MORE: Google’s $20B Deal with Intersect Power and TPG Rise: How Can It Transform Data Centers?

Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted that this deal with Intersect will:

“help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership.”

Intersect Power: Building Energy for the AI Era

Intersect Power was founded in 2016 and grew into a significant player in the clean energy sector. The company builds and develops large solar projects, battery storage systems, and data centers. These projects combine power generation with computing facilities. Intersect has offices in several U.S. states and works with technology and infrastructure partners.

By late 2025, Intersect will manage over 10.8 gigawatts (GW) of energy projects. These projects will be operating, under construction, or in development by 2028. To put that in context, this is more than 20x the electricity production of the Hoover Dam.

Some of Intersect’s clean energy work includes building solar plants in California and battery storage facilities in Texas. These projects are designed to serve both utility grids and data centers with cleaner power sources

Before the acquisition, Intersect had raised more than $2 billion in equity and project financing from investors. It also had existing partnerships with Google and other technology firms.

What Alphabet Is Getting in the Deal: Inside the $4.75B Acquisition

Alphabet is paying $4.75 billion in cash and will also assume Intersect’s existing debt. The acquisition includes the following key elements:

The Intersect leadership team and staff.

A portfolio of energy projects in development or under construction.

Joint infrastructure projects with Google.

Access to emerging technologies in energy generation and storage.

Not every Intersect asset will transfer to Alphabet. Some facilities and projects in Texas and California will stay independent. They will continue to be backed by current investors. Alphabet is focusing on projects that directly support its data center and cloud operations.

Intersect will remain a separate brand and company after the deal closes, led by its current CEO, Sheldon Kimber. The company will continue its broader work while collaborating with Alphabet on shared energy and data center goals.

The Role of Clean Energy and AI

Large data centers consumed 4% of U.S. electricity in 2024, with hyperscale demand hitting 61.8 GW in 2025 (up 22% YoY) amid AI-driven growth to 106-123 GW by 2035.

Alphabet’s facilities used 30.8 TWh in 2024, doubling from 2020 and 95.8% of its total power, for AI model training and cloud services. U.S. grids face record demand in 2025-2026, with data centers projected to double to 9% of electricity by 2030.

Acquiring Intersect Power advances Alphabet’s 24/7 carbon-free by 2030 and net-zero goals. Intersect’s 10.8+ GW pipeline of solar (e.g., 828 MWp TX Lumina) and battery storage (multi-GWh) enables a direct clean supply. This reduces data center emissions intensity, building on Alphabet’s 12% Scope 2 cut in 2024 despite surging demand.

Alphabet aims for net-zero emissions in its operations and value chain by 2030. It also targets 24/7 carbon-free energy for all data centers and offices by the same year. Additionally, it seeks to enable 1 gigaton of annual emissions reductions for users and partners.

In 2024, it secured over 8 GW of clean energy. It achieved 66% carbon-free energy (CFE), matching 80% hourly CFE in 9/20 grids. Despite a 27% rise in electricity use, it cut data center emissions by 12%, bringing them down to 3.1 MtCO2e. Its portfolio includes power purchase agreements (PPAs) and investments in wind, solar, geothermal, and storage. It also has supplier mandates for 100% renewables by 2029.

Intersect plans to explore more technologies. Along with solar and storage, it will look into long-duration storage and advanced generation solutions. This will help diversify the energy supply. These technologies could further support data center growth with more reliable and cleaner power.

Big Tech’s Race to Control Energy Supply

Alphabet is not alone in addressing power needs for AI growth. Other big technology companies are also investing in clean energy, grid modernization, and direct power supply.

Microsoft, for example, has expanded renewable energy contracts and supported nuclear and other low-carbon projects. Amazon has pursued long-term agreements with nuclear power plants and investments in small modular reactor research.

The Intersect acquisition reflects a trend in which cloud and AI companies look beyond simple power purchase agreements. Some companies are adding energy development. This helps them get electricity faster and cut down on grid capacity issues.

Energy infrastructure has become a strategic asset for firms with large data center footprints. Owning or controlling generation and storage helps companies plan capacity better. This way, they can avoid grid connection delays and may reduce long-term costs.

What the Deal Signals for AI and Energy Markets

Alphabet expects the Intersect deal to close in early 2026, pending regulatory approval and standard closing conditions. The acquisition will give Alphabet direct access to clean energy projects. It will also provide talent to support data center expansion.

The transaction also sends a signal about how technology firms are adapting to the challenges of powering AI. Data centers are critical infrastructure for cloud services, search, video, and generative AI. Securing reliable, scalable, and cleaner energy sources is now central to growth strategies for Alphabet and its peers.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2338849359.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 13:13:45.448353

""Investors are so focused on the future with Tesla that they are ignoring delivery numbers. It's about Optimus, ‍Robotaxi and physical AI,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, which owns Tesla shares.

Tesla's fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $US7500 ($A11,221) in federal tax credits after US President Donald Trump's administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down 15.6 per cent from 495,570 a year earlier.

Analysts ​expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 per cent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the ‌full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024.

Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company's second ​consecutive annual decline.

Tesla reached its peak in 2023, delivering more than 1.8 million vehicles.

The decline in deliveries was not a major surprise, given the market had already priced in weaker demand after ‍US EV tax credits ended, said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

Meanwhile, Tesla said it deployed 14.2 GWh of energy storage products, a record high.

It is set to report fourth-quarter results on January 28.

Growing ​competition from Chinese and European car makers such as BYD, Volkswagen ​and BMW has weighed on Tesla's sales momentum.

BYD said sales outside ​of China climbed to a record one million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 per cent from 2024.

The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026 although it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

BYD sold 4.6 million vehicles in 2025 in total, eight per cent more than in the previous year.

These included 2.3 million battery-electric vehicles, which marked an increase of 28 per cent year-on-year, according to the car maker.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $US5000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market ‍product.

Even as vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4 per cent in 2025.

Jan 2 (Reuters) - ceded its crown as the world’s top electric vehicle maker to China’s , after annual sales fell for a second year, hit by rising competition, the expiry of U.S. tax credits and brand backlash.

With global EV sales rising 28% last year, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe, where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival.

Tesla, whose sales fell about 8.6% in 2025, is facing intense competition, especially in Europe, raising questions about its ability to revive the core auto business as CEO Elon Musk steers the company towards robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Shares of the company fell about 2% in afternoon trading.

""Investors are so focused on the future with Tesla that they are ignoring delivery numbers. It’s about Optimus, Robotaxi and physical AI,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, which owns Tesla shares.

END OF TAX CREDIT IN U.S. PINCHES TESLA

Tesla’s fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $7,500 in federal tax credits after President Donald Trump’s administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.

In the U.S., EVs accounted for 6.2% of retail vehicle sales in the quarter, down 3.6 percentage points from a year earlier, while average transaction prices rose nearly $6,000 to $53,300, according to J.D. Power data.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down 15.6% from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles, or a 12.3% drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles.

The decline in deliveries was not a major surprise, given the market had already priced in weaker demand after U.S. EV tax credits ended, said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

Meanwhile, Tesla said it deployed 14.2 GWh of energy storage products, a record high. It is set to report fourth-quarter results on January 28.

INTENSIFYING COMPETITION IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE

Growing competition from Chinese and European automakers such as BYD, and has weighed on Tesla’s sales momentum.

Tesla registrations declined across much of Europe in December but jumped in Norway, where record sales contrasted with shrinking market share in rest of the region in 2025.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150% from 2024. The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk, who once dismissed BYD as a threat. Tesla’s rise had seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make Musk the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Right now, an attack is occurring from two fronts on the foundational law that protects water quality: the Clean Water Act (CWA).
The two proposals weaken the Clean Water Act in many ways including stripping protections from many seasonal streams and wetlands, leaving them vulnerable to pollution, filling, or destruction with little to no accountability.
Oregonians have worked too hard to restore and protect our state’s waterways to watch the gains under a functioning Clean Water Act erased.
The PERMIT Act passed the House of Representatives on Dec. 11, 2025, and is now heading to the Senate.","We all know that clean water is not optional — it is the lifeblood of our communities, our economy, ecosystems and our very lives.

From the headwaters of the Rogue River to the Applegate and Illinois Rivers, small streams and wetlands feed our drinking water supplies, sustain salmon and steelhead, and support farms and recreation. Right now, an attack is occurring from two fronts on the foundational law that protects water quality: the Clean Water Act (CWA).

Proposed changes by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS), combined with Congress’ so-called “Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act” or (PERMIT) Act (H.R. 3898) would both allow the discharge of a range of pollutants into waterways of all kinds and would put the waters we all love and depend upon at serious risk.

The two proposals weaken the Clean Water Act in many ways including stripping protections from many seasonal streams and wetlands, leaving them vulnerable to pollution, filling, or destruction with little to no accountability. These proposals go beyond codifying the Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA 2023 decision to further reduce the scope of federal CWA jurisdiction to eliminate oversight of many activities that pollute water.

The new proposals reject the science about how water functions on the landscape and create new definitions and exclusions that further reduce the ability of the CWA to protect water both by the federal government and even the states themselves.

The PERMIT Act is a sprawling and far-reaching bill that strips away long-standing safeguards for rivers, streams and communities. Its most dangerous component targets Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which is the core power Oregon and Tribes use to review and place conditions on certain types of projects (like dams, pipelines, and large developments) to protect water quality.

If the PERMIT Act passes, it would handcuff Oregon’s ability to protect its waters by narrowing the ability of the state to review pollution and forcing the state to ignore cumulative and downstream impacts. One provision would block the ability of states to enforce their own water quality standards if they were stronger than federal minimums.

Even if a state manages to impose conditions on a project, it could not enforce them. That power would be transferred to federal agencies, as the bill takes authority away from the people who know and depend on these rivers most. The bill would also allow political appointees to exclude waters so that top officials at EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers could exclude any waters they choose from protection, without public input, science, or oversight.

The list of harms goes on to include numerous changes to the Clean Water Act that will work to tilt the scales away from science and public oversight in the name of “streamlining” permits, but the reality is fewer protections, less accountability, and more pollution in the waters we depend on.

The hacking away at laws like the Clean Water Act are how self determination and power is taken away from citizens, states, tribes and communities. It is how corporations take control and gain power and our environment loses. Oregonians have worked too hard to restore and protect our state’s waterways to watch the gains under a functioning Clean Water Act erased.

We should be strengthening clean water laws — not rolling them back to benefit polluters at the expense of our health, our fisheries and future generations.

Comments to the proposed changes to WOTUS can be submitted at Regulations.gov to Docket No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322 until Monday, Jan. 5, 2026. The PERMIT Act passed the House of Representatives on Dec. 11, 2025, and is now heading to the Senate.

The American automaker faces mounting pressure from intensifying global competition, the elimination of U.S. federal tax incentives, and reputational challenges that have dampened consumer demand.

Key Takeaways:

BYD became the world’s top EV seller in 2025, surpassing Tesla for the first time on an annual basis amid 28% global EV market growth

Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down from 1.79 million in 2024, marking two straight years of sales contraction

The company’s fourth-quarter deliveries dropped 15.6% year-over-year to 418,227 units, missing analyst expectations of 434,487 vehicles

BYD’s ascent comes as the Chinese manufacturer rapidly expands its European presence while Tesla struggles to maintain momentum in key markets. The shift raises serious questions about Tesla’s ability to stabilize its automotive operations even as CEO Elon Musk pivots company resources toward robotics and autonomous driving technology to support the company’s premium stock valuation.

Tesla’s fourth-quarter performance followed a temporary surge in third-quarter sales as buyers rushed to claim federal EV tax credits before their September expiration. The subsequent quarter revealed the true impact of losing those incentives. President Donald Trump’s administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credits at the end of September, creating immediate headwinds for U.S. EV adoption.

The automaker reported 418,227 vehicle deliveries for the October-December period, falling short of analyst projections by roughly 16,000 units. For the full year, deliveries reached approximately 1.64 million vehicles against analyst expectations of 1.65 million—confirming the company’s second consecutive annual decline.

“I think the market remains focused on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar. “If deliveries can continue to not be down too much in the coming quarters, I expect market sentiment around the robotaxi will continue to drive the stock,” Goldstein added.

Tesla shares gained marginally in early trading following the announcement and closed 2025 up approximately 11.4%, adding billions to Musk’s personal wealth despite the automotive business setbacks.

Competition Heats Up Across North America and Europe

The company faced unprecedented pressure throughout 2025 in its core North American and European markets. Industry analysts point to two primary factors: aggressive competition from Chinese manufacturers and established European automakers, plus brand perception issues stemming from Musk’s political activities and public statements.

BYD demonstrated exceptional international growth, selling 1 million vehicles outside China in 2025—a 150% increase from 2024. The Chinese automaker has set ambitious targets for 2026, aiming to sell up to 1.6 million vehicles in international markets, though it hasn’t disclosed total global sales projections.

German automotive giants Volkswagen and BMW have also intensified their electric vehicle offerings, capturing market share from Tesla in European territories where the American brand previously enjoyed stronger positioning.

In October, Tesla attempted to defend its market position by introducing “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced approximately $5,000 below previous entry-level configurations. The company designed these stripped-down variants to offset the tax credit elimination and appeal to European buyers seeking more affordable electric options.

However, investors responded coolly to the pricing strategy. Many had anticipated deeper price reductions or the introduction of an entirely new mass-market vehicle rather than simplified versions of existing models. The tepid response highlighted expectations that Tesla needs more aggressive measures to counter competitive pressures and restore sales growth.

The contrasting performance between Tesla’s declining vehicle deliveries and rising stock price reflects investor focus on the company’s future technology initiatives rather than current automotive sales. Wall Street appears willing to look past near-term delivery challenges based on optimism about Tesla’s robotaxi development, artificial intelligence capabilities, and other advanced projects that differentiate it from traditional automakers.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiago-ferreira-sZSczDpZT80-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:58:34.636079

Lightweight materials reduce resource needs, while smart sensors and IoT-based monitoring minimise breakdowns and ensure smoother, safer journeys.

TK Elevator’s EOX platform is designed to be both eco-efficient and digitally native. Belt-traction systems lower power consumption, adaptive “eco mode” technology learns traffic patterns, and regenerative braking feeds energy back into the grid, reducing shaft-travel energy use by up to 28 per cent.

Local manufacturing, global standards

Combining TK Elevator’s craftsmanship and Alat’s advanced manufacturing platform, the venture creates a model for the future of industrial innovation, scaling impact across the Middle East.

The facility will be built around advanced, AI-guided systems and follow a framework for responsible, circular production that aligns with both European and Saudi quality and sustainability standards.

The venture is also a catalyst for investment, knowledge exchange, and skills development. It is expected to create high-skilled jobs, embed international expertise in Saudi Arabia’s workforce, and strengthen Alat’s role as a bridge between global technology leaders and the Kingdom’s industrial ecosystem, while opening opportunities for European industry to lead smart infrastructure developments worldwide.

TK Elevator has been listed on the CDP A-List for climate transparency several years running and holds an EcoVadis Gold rating, placing it among the top five per cent of companies rated.

A blueprint for future partnerships

The Alat–TK Elevator venture demonstrates how cross-border collaboration is driving innovation, with Saudi Arabia’s strategic location and strong internal connectivity creating a positive climate for global companies seeking to establish a presence in the region.

Supported by strong institutional alignment and long-term national priorities, Alat is positioned to advance partnerships that accelerate industrialisation, technology localisation and capability building across priority sectors.

Alat has already begun leveraging this model in collaborations with global firms. Its US$150 million partnership with SoftBank aims to establish a next-generation industrial automation business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that will manufacture advanced industrial robots, while its US$2 billion partnership with Lenovo aims to make Saudi Arabia a hub for advanced technology manufacturing.

Lenovo is building its largest factory outside China in Riyadh to produce millions of “Saudi Made” laptops, desktops, and servers. The project also includes R&D operations, driving localisation, innovation, and job creation in line with Vision 2030.

Combining European design and engineering expertise, Saudi Arabia’s exciting high-growth market and Vision 2030 ambition, and Alat’s mission to anchor advanced manufacturing in the Kingdom, the Alat–TK Elevator partnership is laying the foundations for tomorrow’s cities: efficient, human-centred hubs underpinned by sustainability, connectivity and global collaboration, where people and infrastructure rise together.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/60/04/56/1200x675_cmsv2_b5bd0ada-5127-5521-b1bf-7533e9e02640-9600456.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:58:43.245087

In recent years, 70-plus US states, cities, and other subnational governments have sued big oil for alleged climate deception. This year, courts repeatedly rejected fossil fuel interests’ attempts to thwart those cases. The supreme court denied a plea to kill a Honolulu lawsuit, and turned down an unusual bid by red states to block the cases. Throughout the year, state courts also shot down attempts to dismiss cases or remand them to federal courts which are seen as more favorable to oil interests.

But challenges against big oil also encountered stumbling blocks. In May, Puerto Rico voluntarily dismissed its 2024 lawsuit under pressure. Charleston, South Carolina also declined to appeal its case after it was dismissed.

In the coming weeks, the supreme court is expected to decide if it will review a climate lawsuit filed by Boulder, Colorado, against two major oil companies. Their decision could embolden or hinder climate accountability litigation.

“So far, the oil companies have had a losing record trying to get these cases thrown out,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, which backs the litigation against the industry. “The question is, does Boulder change that?”

After Colorado’s supreme court refused to dismiss the lawsuit, the energy companies filed a petition with the supreme court asking them to kill the case on the grounds that it is pre-empted by federal laws. If the high court declines to weigh in on the petition – or takes it up and rules in favor of the plaintiffs – that could be boon for climate accountability cases. But if the justices agrees with the oil companies, it could void the Boulder case – and more than a dozen others which make similar claims.

That would be a “major challenge”, said Wiles, “but it wouldn’t be game over for the wave of litigation”.

“It would not mean the end of big oil being held accountable in the court,” he said.

The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s largest oil lobby group, did not respond to a request to comment.

3. Accountability shield

Big oil ramped up its efforts to evade accountability for its past actions this year, said Wiles. They were aided by allies like Trump, who in April signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department to halt climate accountability litigation and similar policies.

In July, members of Congress also tried to cut off Washington DC’s access to funding to enforce its consumer protection laws “against oil and gas companies for environmental claims” by inserting language into a proposed House appropriations bill. A committee passed that version of the text, but the full House never voted on it.

2025 also brought mounting evidence that big oil is pushing for a federal liability shield, which could resemble a 2005 law that has largely insulated the firearms industry from lawsuits. In June, 16 Republican state attorneys general asked the Justice Department to help create a “liability shield” for fossil fuel companies against climate lawsuits, the New York Times reported. Lobbying disclosures further show the nation’s largest oil trade group, as well as energy giant ConocoPhillips, lobbying Congress about draft legislation on the topic, according to Inside Climate News.

Such a waiver could potentially exempt the industry from virtually all climate litigation. The battle is expected to heat up next year.

“We expect they could sneak language to grant them immunity, into some must-pass bill,” said Wiles. “That’s how we think they’ll play it, so we’ve been talking to every person on the Democratic side so that they keep a lookout for this language.”

4. What to watch in 2026: plastics and extreme weather cases

Despite the challenges ahead, 2026 will almost definitely bring more climate accountability lawsuits against not only big oil but also other kinds of emitting companies. This year, New York’s attorney general notched a major win by securing a $1.1m settlement from the world’s biggest meat company, JBS, over alleged greenwashing. The victory could inspire more cases, said Merner, who noted that many such lawsuits have been filed abroad.

Wiles expects more cases to accuse oil companies of deception about plastic pollution, like the one California filed last year. He also expects more lawsuits which focus on harms caused by specific extreme weather events, made possible by advances in attribution science – which links particular disasters to global warming. Researchers and law firms are also developing new theories to target the industry, with groundbreaking cases likely to be filed in 2026.

“Companies have engaged in decades of awful behavior that creates liability on so many fronts,” he said. “We haven’t even really scratched the surface of the numerous ways they could be held legally accountable for their behavior.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38995d2c47863ea1f1e0c9954052cf86b8a62e27/2345_1336_3174_2538/master/3174.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57409f9691b7113b35ba2e5be427e3c1",N,,2026-01-02 12:14:16.831060

By integrating an existing solar park with a 200 MWh battery energy storage system, the project has become the largest solar-plus-storage facility in Northern Europe.

The solar park has been operational since 2022, with battery modules installed within the existing site. European Energy completed the battery works in just seven months, covering full installation, electrical integration with the solar plant and the grid, and the construction of supporting infrastructure.

Following energisation, the project will now enter a commissioning phase, during which the battery system’s technical components will be prepared for full commercial operation.

“The energising of the Kvosted solar and battery park marks the beginning of European Energy’s large-scale implementation of yet another technology. This will increase during 2026 with large-scale batteries expected to come into operation,” says Mads Lykke Andersen, Head of Technology Development at European Energy.

Solar power already plays a central role in Denmark’s electricity mix, at times covering more than 60% of national demand on days with high irradiation. This underscores the growing need for energy storage to smooth production fluctuations and support grid stability.

“In the future, we will place strong emphasis on batteries across our project portfolio. Kvosted solar and battery park is a project where we show that the roll-out of battery systems is now beginning in earnest,” says Thorvald Spanggaard, EVP and Head of Project Development at European Energy. “Towards 2027, we will across our European Markets install more than 1 GW of battery capacity.

Both proposed rules require facilities that detect the substances to submit a mitigation plan to NCDEQ.

The proposed “monitoring and minimization” rule would require industrial facilities to sample their wastewater and, if the compounds are detected, submit a plan to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to reduce levels over time. However, it leaves out discharge limits and has some critics calling the rules “toothless.”

The vote, scheduled for Jan. 7 and 8 in Raleigh, represents a shift in strategy from 2024, when state scientists proposed setting hard caps on the concentration of chemicals allowed in the water. Under the current draft, there are no fixed numeric limits and no automatic civil penalties for facilities who continue to discharge the chemicals, provided they are following a state-approved minimization plan.

ALSO: CFPUA assesses treatment options for 1,4 dioxane, pilot-test could come next year

The new rules were developed in March 2025 following a directive from the EMC’s Water Quality Committee to focus on identifying the source of the pollution rather than installing concentration levels. The previous 2024 draft proposed a limit of 0.35 parts per billion for 1,4-dioxane and near-zero levels for eight PFAS compounds, including PFOA, PFOS, GenX, PFBS, PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, and PFNA. Often called “forever chemicals,” PFAS are associated by the Environmental Protection Agency with an increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer, and liver damage.

1,4-dioxane is a synthetic industrial solvent the EPA classifies as a “likely human carcinogen,” linked to liver and kidney toxicity.

EMC Water Quality Committee Chairman and EMC Commissioner Steve Keen noted in a previous public meeting from March 2025 much of the current draft’s language originated from the NC Water Quality Association. The NCWQA represents the state’s largest public utilities — including the Cape Fear Public Utilities Authority — but is often criticized by environmentalist groups as a pro-industry lobby because it also advocates for industrial dischargers.

NCWQA members Asheboro, Greensboro, and Reidsville successfully sued the state in 2024 to overturn 1,4-dioxane limits, a move currently being challenged by the Southern Environmental Law Center. Despite being a member, CFPUA executive director Kenneth Waldroup has distanced the utility from the proposed rules, noting in a May 2025 letter to the EMC that regulation without enforceable targets is “no more than an action in name only providing empty promises to the people of North Carolina.”

By allowing the association to help write the rules, critics like the SELC argue the EMC essentially allowed chemical dischargers to set their own terms.

The 15-member EMC body — appointed by the governor, General Assembly leaders, and the agricultural commissioner — is charged with reviewing and enacting rules for NCDEQ. The commission is considering the regulatory package as a single item, though it technically consists of two rules addressing different classes of contaminants. The first targets three specific PFAS compounds — PFOA, PFOS, and GenX — and the other rule for 1,4-dioxane.

PFOA and PFOS are “legacy” chemicals phased out of production years ago, but continue to persist in the environment and contaminate local waterways. In contrast, GenX is a modern replacement chemical still actively manufactured at the Chemours Fayetteville Works facility.

Although the EPA established federal limits of 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS in 2024, the agency moved in May 2025 to rescind protections for several other chemicals — GenX, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFBS. It leaves North Carolina without any enforceable federal or state limits on GenX discharge, meaning the monitoring and minimization rules currently before the EMC are now the only active regulatory proposal on the table for the compound.

There is currently no enforceable federal limit for 1,4-dioxane, though the EPA maintains a non-enforceable health advisory level of 0.35 parts per billion.

Both proposed rules require facilities that detect the substances to submit a mitigation plan to NCDEQ. The plans would outline how a facility intends to lower its discharge and be subject to a state review every two years.

For downstream communities like Wilmington, the primary question is how the lack of hard discharge limits affects water treatment costs. In 2024, an NCDEQ fiscal analysis suggested setting numeric limits at the source of pollution could save the state $9.96 billion over 36 years, primarily by reducing the need for expensive filtration at municipal water plants.

The Cape Fear Public Utilities Authority installed granular activated carbon filters in 2022 for $46 million, to remove PFAS to non-detectable levels in the water, but the filters are less effective at removing 1,4-dioxane. Unlike PFAS, which sticks to the carbon filters, 1,4-dioxane stays bonded to water molecules and passes right through them.

To manage 1,4-dioxane, CFPUA utilizes ozone and biological filters at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant, which breaks down the chemical rather than just trapping it. While the current system removes about 52% of 1,4-dioxane from raw water, the utility is exploring alternative and potentially expensive methods to remove the chemical completely.

Because the proposed rule does not mandate a specific reduction in upstream pollution, local filtration systems would remain the primary line of defense. Hannah Nelson, attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, wrote in a December 2025 letter to the commission the rules represent a “polluter wish-list” allowing industries to continue discharging toxic waste without facing consequences.

“By moving to a monitoring-only model, the state is allowing these companies to prioritize their profits over the health of communities downstream,” Nelson said to Port City Daily. “Water utilities and their ratepayers are ultimately left paying the bill for infrastructure that should have been funded by the polluters themselves.”

However, the NC Water Quality Association defends its approach as a “practical necessity.” In a letter to the EMC from September 2024, supported by the cities of Greensboro, Asheboro, and Raleigh, association attorney Paul Calamita argued setting immediate numeric limits would place an expensive burden on municipal taxpayers and utility ratepayers. He contended many local wastewater plants were never designed to remove industrial chemicals like 1,4-dioxane and would require “large capital investments” for infrastructure upgrades, the cost ultimately trickling down to ratepayers.

CPUA’s GAC filters have led to two specific rate increases on Wilmington taxpayers since 2022. The initial jump went into effect on July 1, 2022, when the average monthly bill increased by $5.39 — a hike CFPUA leadership said was 70% driven by the need to treat Chemours’ PFAS. A second 4.6% increase followed in 2024, attributed to a $1.3 million rise in annual operating expenses for the GAC filters.

CFPUA is pursuing a federal lawsuit against Chemours to recover treatment costs, which, if successful, CFPUA director Waldroup noted in 2022 would lead to a reduction in customer rates.

Because the substances are costly to treat, the NC Water Quality Association maintains the state should first find exact industries that are sending chemicals to city wastewater treatment plants. The association contends mandating strict reduction targets is unrealistic until the state better understands the source.

SELC’s Nelson countered, without numeric limits the new rules do not provide enough incentive for industries to change their practices.

“NCDEQ’s rules would have made sure that polluters kept their pollution below a level that it determined would not threaten health,” Nelson said. “In contrast, the EMC’s polluter-written rules do nothing to reduce pollution from industry or wastewater treatment plants. There is no level that dischargers must meet, and there are no consequences if a polluter fails to reduce its toxic pollution at all.

The SELC also warns the new rules remove public transparency. While the state currently tracks 40 different “forever chemicals” at various facilities, the proposed framework would only require industries to report data for three — PFOA, PFOS, and GenX.

In practice, SELC attorney Jean Zhuang argues this creates a “redaction loophole.” Because labs typically test for dozens of chemicals at once, a facility will receive a report showing the full extent of its pollution.

“In practice, this means that dischargers will receive a lab report showing the levels of dozens of PFAS compounds and will then redact all but the PFOA, PFOS, and GenX data,” Zhuang wrote.

The timing of the EMC’s vote is significant due to the REINS Act, H.B. 402, which became law in August 2025. The act requires any regulation with a projected financial impact of $20 million or more over five years must be approved by the General Assembly, regardless of its public benefit.

Implementing numeric limits for PFAS and 1,4-dioxane would likely exceed the $20-million threshold because of expensive infrastructure costs required to remove the compounds. Since many facilities across the state would need technology like CFPUA’s GAC filters, the total cost statewide would be in the hundreds of millions. The city of Pittsboro already operates its own GAC system, while Greensboro and Fayetteville are currently in the process of constructing GAC facilities.

“The REINS Act made it very difficult for strong — science-based rules to get passed,” Nelson stated. “We know that rules designed to protect water quality can be expensive, but they come with a lot of benefits and often more benefits than costs.”

The EMC Water Quality Committee will meet Wednesday, Jan. 7, to consider and vote on the proposed rules, with the full EMC is expected to take a final vote on Thursday, Jan. 8, at 9 a.m. Both meetings will be held at the Archdale Building in Raleigh and are open to the public, though a livestream is also available.

If the EMC moves forward with the proposal, it does not immediately become law. Instead, the vote starts a mandatory 60-day public comment period, a window advocates say is the last chance for residents to influence the outcome.

“I hope that the EMC listens to the public opposition to these rules and changes their mind,” Nelson said. “I hope they realize that their job is to protect the water we drink and the communities that rely on it, not polluters’ profits.”

If denied, the state would remain without formal rules for the chemicals and the process to establish those rules would effectively restart.

NCDEQ leadership did not respond to requests for comment by press. A spokesperson for the agency cited limited staff availability during the holidays and indicated a formal response would not be available until the first week of the new year; this will be updated upon their response.

Tesla delivered 1,636,129 vehicles in 2025, 9% below the previous year's figure. It was the company's second straight yearly decline, which allowed competitors to gain ground.

After narrowly coming up short of Tesla's EV sales in 2024, Chinese rival BYD announced that it had surpassed the American firm in 2025 with 2,256,714 deliveries, up 28% year-over-year.

Despite slumping EV sales, the year saw some bright spots for Tesla: In October, the company posted revenue growth in the third quarter, likely as buyers took advantage of expiring tax credits for EVs. And in mid-December, despite Morgan Stanley downgrading its rating on the company shortly before, Tesla's stock climbed to an all-time high, setting its first record high in a year.

The stock's comeback—it more than doubled from its March lows—could be traced to excitement about the company's plans for robotics, AI and the rollout of its robotaxi service, as well as for CEO Elon Musk's renewed commitment to the company after spending the earlier part of 2025 heading President Donald Trump's DOGE cost-cutting effort.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicted in a December note that 2026 will be a ""game changer"" for the company. “We believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,” wrote Ives, who thinks Tesla stock could rise to $800 by the end of this year.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/g-KjGwSoTxsaZI4N3cup4GYvs50=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2250976740-9c9eaee537484d328e1c65f7016f1934.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:58:39.448355

The Climate Smart Communities Grant Program is one component of the larger, interagency CSC Program that was established in 2009.","Largest-Ever Grant Awards Bolstered by Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act Funding

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton today announced $22.7 million in Climate Smart Communities Grant awards for 43 projects to help municipalities take action to address climate change. This year’s funded projects reduce flood risk by retrofitting or relocating critical infrastructure, support decreasing transportation emissions through cycling and walkability projects, reduce emissions from food waste and landfills, and undertake engineering feasibility studies to advance future climate projects, among many other actions.

“DEC’s Climate Smart Communities grants support municipal investments to reduce pollution, protect the environment, and increase community resilience to climate impacts and severe weather,” Commissioner Lefton said. “Governor Kathy Hochul recognizes reducing harmful emissions and advancing climate equity is critical to improving New Yorkers’ health and quality of life, while also helping save money on energy costs. DEC is proud of our partnerships with local governments taking the lead on climate adaptation and resilience statewide.”

Funding for the Climate Smart Communities (CSC) Grant Program is supported by the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act and the State's Environmental Protection Fund, which was increased to a record $425 million in the 2025-26 State Budget. Since the program's inception in 2016, DEC awarded more than $109 million to municipalities through the CSC Grant program in support of local climate mitigation and adaptation projects.

As part of the CSC Grant Program, municipalities are required to provide a local match of 50 percent of the total costs for most projects. Last year’s New York State budget made grants more accessible to more communities by authorizing DEC to provide up to 80 percent of the cost for municipal projects that meet criteria for financial hardship and for projects located in disadvantaged communities.

In Portugal, guaranteeing a sustainable future.

EDP supported the X Congress of Environmental Sciences of Andalusia, which brought to the debate the circular economy as one of the essential models to guarantee a sustainable future.

The future must be circular

EDP sponsored the X Congress of Environmental Sciences of Andalusia on circular economy, organized by the College of Environmentalists of Andalusia (COAMBA), on November 3 and 4, 2022, in Seville.

Among the main conclusions of the invited experts, the following stand out:

The circular economy should be the guiding axis of all actions, of individuals and companies, and there is an urgent need for a change in business models;

The circular economy is a paradigm that affects production, consumption and financing. If we want the economy to be circular, it is necessary to transform the rules of the game. The solution will be to seek collaboration mechanisms between entities, so that we can face the challenges that lie ahead in the coming years;

The planet is sick, and there continues to be an increasing extraction of resources, which are finite. It is essential that we are able to take advantage of the raw materials present in products;

A more efficient use of raw materials should require that products remain in the economy as long as possible. It is essential that we find ways to make products last longer;

Making money, being more competitive and having a better relationship with the planet is possible. The future will have to be circular or we probably won't have a future;

If it is so important and urgent to move from the linear to the circular model, why don't we do it?

DHL's GoGreen Plus products provide decarbonized solutions across DHL's core offerings by leveraging sustainable fuels and low carbon technology. GoGreen Plus products are based on true value chain decarbonization. This is enabled by the 'book & claim' approach. Book & claim enables DHL to directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within the logistic company's network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported with the assets using these fuels. GoGreen Plus allows DHL's customers to reduce their indirect Scope 3 emissions in their value chain arising from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution. It also helps customers with voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and progress against their decarbonization targets.

The laws cover a range of categories, from business and real estate, to healthcare, adoption and gender identity. The laws, reflecting a legislative process that often saw the state legislature pitted against the governor, as the two power centers looked to weigh proposed legislation in their favor.

NEW NORTH CAROLINA LAW STRICTLY DEFINING SEXES AS MALE OR FEMALE GOES INTO EFFECT

House Bill 805 was passed after a legislative override of the governor’s veto. The bill began life as a bipartisan effort to protect women and children from online sexual predators. After passing the state House, the bill was re-shaped in the Senate into what became an effort to codify gender identity into North Carolina law. The new law, which recognizes only two genders on all official state documentation, requires individuals to be identified by their gender at birth and not by their chosen gender identity or presentation. The change would most notably affect identification, such as driver’s licenses. While state senator Kevin Corbin (R) calls it “fair for everyone,” state senator Julie Mayfield (D) calls it “another example of importing to North Carolina this national anti-LGBTQ agenda.”

Senate Bill 248 takes a significant step in reducing the differences in birth certificates for those who are adopted. The new law allows for adoptive parents to be named on a child’s birth certificate, while making it easier for counties to issue certified birth certificates to adopted individuals.

Senate Bill 690 covers a range of business/broker-related issues. Most notably, its provision changes what is allowed on a real estate purchase offer. The change allows compensation paid (or commission to be paid) to a buyer’s agent to be included in the offer. The full disclosure could have an effect on the negotiation process and the purchase price of a property.

House Bill 67 is designed to increase the number of healthcare professionals serving patients in North Carolina. The legislation clears a pathway for licensed physicians and physician assistants to be employed at North Carolina hospitals. It also allows for more internationally trained medical professionals to gain entry to hospitals in the state. The law includes a provision allowing PAs who are licensed in North Carolina to practice in other states.

Time to kick him in the tender parts.
Here’s an idea: Jane Bolin (1908-2007), the first Black woman to serve as a New York State Judge, was from nearby Poughkeepsie.
Lewis Morris: I’m sorry Mr. President, but the simple fact is that our legislature has never sent us explicit instructions on anything!
[turns to the Congress as he returns to his seat] Lewis Morris: I beg the Congress’s pardon.","Why in the world does New York still have the Donald J. Trump State Park?

You might have missed it, but while most normal Americans were celebrating the New Year, Donald Trump continued his serial ransacking of public spaces and buildings. On New Year’s Eve, the Administration announced the cancelling of leases of three DC golf courses, with the intention of transferring the leases to the Trump Organization. As golf reporter Kevin Van Valkenburg noted,

This hasn’t resonated yet outside golf, but what this administration is essentially doing is taking over a national park for invented reasons so that the Trump Organization can run it and profit from it. Imagine if Yellowstone suddenly cost $1,000 but mostly served lobbyists.

If you don’t care about golf [this includes me – JZ], that’s fine. If your politics differ from mine, that’s totally fine too. Some issues can involve politicians but still be above politics. There isn’t any justification for this beyond a transfer of public land use to a wealthier class of people.

Because populism, of course.

It didn’t stop there. The Oval Office Occupant announced that his building of his new triumphal arch in DC will begin in around two months.

Now, Donald Trump is a constant bullsh*tter (in the Frankfurtian sense): he just says things if they sound good and make him feel good. He doesn’t care whether they are true. And in the latter case, his action is likely illegal (as was his purporting renaming of the Kennedy Center). Although with the current, comically-corrupt Supreme Court, one as always is tempted to ask: what is this legality of which you speak?

This is straight-up Nazi stuff. That is not hyperbole. As I explained a few months ago, this is pretty much what Albert Speer tried to do to Berlin: rip out people and make it full of monuments to the Reich.

In addition to lawsuits, What Is To Be Done?

Let me introduce you to Donald J. Trump State Park in the Hudson Valley. Huh?

Turns out that a quarter century ago, Trump attempted to build a golf course and resort on the site, and – always on-brand – proposed doing so by filling wetlands and despoiling the local environment.. After resistance from neighbors and environmental laws, he gave up and “donated” the property to the state.

In typical fashion it involved fraud:

Despite the purchase price of $2.75 million, and a county assessment of $5.5 million at the time of the donation, Trump’s 2016 campaign said in a list of charitable donations published by The Washington Post that the land was worth $26.1 million.

Then-Governor George Pataki agreed to name it after him, although as far as I can tell that was not a requirement. Trump, of course, boasted that it would be the greatest park in the state.

And as with all of Trump’s boasts, it didn’t turn out that way. A local television station reported in 2019 that

An hour’s drive north of Manhattan, Donald J. Trump State Park is what New York euphemistically calls a “passive park,” meaning it has no trails, picnic tables or other amenities. The state stopped maintaining it in 2010, and the land lies covered in brambles, mud and rocks.

In 2017, an article on website The A.V. Club framed the park as an “abandoned wasteland”, with “muddy fields, overgrown tennis courts, and dilapidated buildings” and a swimming pool in disrepair.”

And there it sits. So now the New York Legislature has the chance to do a very funny thing and rename it. Trump is acutely sensitive to what he perceives as personal slights: at times, I think he doesn’t really have a personalities, but just a series of impulses, bigotries, and grievances. Time to kick him in the tender parts.

Who to rename it after? The touchstone for me is what would enrage Trump the most. That would suggest an African-American or a woman or both. There already is a Shirley Chisholm State Park. Here’s an idea: Jane Bolin (1908-2007), the first Black woman to serve as a New York State Judge, was from nearby Poughkeepsie. Or perhaps a certain former President, despite his lack of connection to the area.

In any event, now is the time. I mean, except for all the other times that different legislators have talked about it, gotten press for claiming it should be renamed, and then nothing happens. Back in 2023, blogger Michael Balter wrote a thoughtful post noting that legislators had made a big deal about changing the name, but when you look at the fine print, it just proposed a commission to study the name change:

This does not look, to me, like a serious attempt to give the people of New York a nice park that is not named after a terrible man. It looks like an attempt by local Democrats to generate a little publicity and then hide behind some lawyer’s cowardly interpretation of the law to throw up their hands and say, we tried, but nothing can be done. That would continue to save the state the money it has not spent on the park every year since 2006, and provide a great excuse to keep on not spending that money.

It all reminds me of one of my favorite musicals, 1776, a dramatization of the creation of the Declaration of Independence. It’s terrific, and hilarious, and bears little resemblance whatsoever to actual history. One of the funniest subplots is that throughout all the tense political battles and arguments, the New York delegation never votes on anything. It always abstains, no matter the issue, no matter the stakes. The delegation head, Lewis Morris, always rises and “abstains, courteously.” Which, after weeks and weeks and dozens of abstentions in an increasingly hot and humid (not to mention “foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy“) Philadelphia, leads to this colloquy between Morris and Congress President John Hancock:

Lewis Morris: [as John Hancock is about to swat a fly] Mr. Secretary, New York abstains, courteously.

[Hancock raises his fly swatter at Morris, then draws back]

John Hancock: Mr. Morris,

[pause, then shouts]

John Hancock: WHAT IN HELL GOES ON IN NEW YORK?

Lewis Morris: I’m sorry Mr. President, but the simple fact is that our legislature has never sent us explicit instructions on anything!

John Hancock: NEVER?

[slams fly swatter onto his desk]

John Hancock: That’s impossible!

Lewis Morris: Mr. President, have you ever been present at a meeting of the New York legislature?

[Hancock shakes his head “No”]

Lewis Morris: They speak very fast and very loud, and nobody listens to anybody else, with the result that nothing ever gets done.

[turns to the Congress as he returns to his seat]

Lewis Morris: I beg the Congress’s pardon.

John Hancock: [grimly] My sympathies, Mr. Morris.

Enough. It’s time. Rename the park.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Donald-J-Trump-State-Park-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:14:21.261075

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla’s rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Much is gloomy, but there are positive developments all the time — so many, in fact, that it’s easy to miss some of the things that have been happening.

For the past few years, I’ve been compiling year-end lists of the more neglected good and bad climate stories to give an idea of the immense amount of change as the world transitions to new sources of energy amid a gathering environmental crisis.

Here’s my selection of major developments over the past 12 months:

Some grids have almost decarbonized

You might not know it from the prevailing mood of Trump-era defeatism, but in some parts of the world, decarbonizing electricity is approaching its endgame. Roughly three-quarters of power generation in the UK and Europe this year came from non-fossil sources, putting them in about the same place as Brazil and Canada, whose vast hydroelectric resources traditionally gave them some of the cleanest grids.

With more renewables added each year, current projects under construction and in late-stage development should put Europe’s grid between 80% to 90% clean energy, the level at which further advances will start to get far more difficult without massive battery usage, new flexible technologies, or both. That means a looming slowdown in renewable deployment, something that many will regard as some sort of failure. In fact, it’s a testament to the monumental achievement so far, and an example the rest of the world should now emulate.

We may have passed peak cement

As much as 8% of the world’s emissions come from the production of cement — but the collapse of China’s real estate boom is turning that tide. The country’s output through October was the lowest since 2009, suggesting that the full-year total will be in the region of 1.7 billion metric tons. Combined with the sluggish 1% to 2% pace of growth forecast in the rest of the world, that suggests global consumption will be the lowest since 2012.

There may be further to fall. China still consumes 1.2 tons of cement per capita, about four times the rate of the rest of the world — but construction starts, a leading indicator for demand, are collapsing even faster, with commercial groundbreaking at its weakest since 2005. Developed countries use only about 16% of global cement, and China is now developed in all but name. A boom like the one we saw over the past decade will never return. Even India and sub-Saharan Africa won’t be big enough to take its place.

EVs are going global

If you were looking only at the parlous state of electric vehicle sales in some developed markets — the U.S., say, or Japan or Italy — you might think the entire technology is faltering. Far from it. Plug-in cars have been comprising more than half of all sales in China and just under a third in Europe in recent months. More dramatic, though, is what’s been happening in less-noticed developing countries.

EVs have had a sales share of more than 20% in recent months in Turkey, Thailand, and Vietnam, while Indonesia isn’t far behind. Markets as diverse as Nepal, Ethiopia, Laos, Armenia and the United Arab Emirates are adopting EVs far faster than many developed countries. Some 27.3% of all passenger vehicle sales worldwide in the September quarter came with a plug, according to BloombergNEF. If you think the EV revolution is losing speed, it’s probably just a sign that your own domestic market is getting left behind.

The course of the energy transition never did run smooth — but I’ve noticed over the past few years of writing these lists that events in retrospect look much better than the depressing prospect you get from a cursory look at the news. Let’s hope that pattern plays out in 2026, too.

He has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin earlier this year, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

Nearly every car sold in Norway in 2025 was an EV, and that rising tide lifted even Tesla's boat.","Happy New Year! It's January 2, 2026, and this is The Morning Shift — your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, we're looking at Tesla's ever-dropping sales, as well as BYD taking its place as the top-selling EV maker globally. We'll also look at how things are going in Norway, EV-wise, and Zeeker's plans to sell to ze Germans.

For years, Tesla has been the top-selling EV maker globally. It really defined the market, getting into pure-EV sales before any other company did so at the same scale, and it's been the company to beat ever since. Until 2025, at least, when it was finally beaten. Now, BYD is the top-selling EV maker in the world. The BBC has BYD's sales numbers:

China's BYD is set to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival for annual sales.

On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.

Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analysts' estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole.

Since that writing, though, we've gotten Tesla's numbers in.They're a bit better than predicted by the BBC, but not by much: Tesla delivered 1,636,129 cars in 2025, far from the 2.25 million EVs that BYD sold. BYD has beaten Tesla in sales before, technically, but those numbers included PHEVs alongside fully-electric cars. Now, BYD wins with no caveats: It sold more EVs than Tesla, end of sentence.

Tesla is circling the sales drain. The company's CEO seems more focused on robotics (and, for some reason, fast food) than actually selling cars, which has had a predictably detrimental effect on car sales. Well, that, and the whole ""shoving his nose into politics"" thing. In most of Europe, things are looking bad for Tesla. From Reuters:

Tesla registrations fell in some key European markets in December, but surged in Norway confirming a trend of record sales in Europe's EV trailblazer while the U.S. automaker's market share crumbled across the rest of the region in 2025.

Elon Musk's EV brand has seen slowing sales in Europe since late 2024 due to growing competition, its aging lineup and protests against Musk's public praise of European right-wing political figures. It is also expected to report a sharp drop in global fourth-quarter delivery numbers later on Friday.

...

In France, Europe's third-biggest car market after Germany and Britain, Tesla registrations – a proxy for sales – slumped 66% last month to 1,942 vehicles, data from French car body PFA showed on Thursday.

Registrations fell 37% in France in 2025 as a whole.

In Sweden, Tesla registrations fell 71% to 821 vehicles in December leading to a 70% drop in 2025, according to Mobility Sweden.

They also dropped in Portugal and Spain, by 13% to 1,207 cars and 44% to 1,794 respectively, official data showed. For 2025 as a whole, sales fell 22% in Portugal and 4% in Spain.

As we talked about above, Tesla's own numbers paint a bad picture. Fourth-quarter deliveries are down 15%, while full-year numbers are down 9%. Yet, while Tesla, the company that builds and sells cars, seems to be doing worse and worse every day, Tesla the stock is doing just fine. As of this writing, shares in $TSLA are actually up today despite the bad sales news.

Tesla's global sales decline has one exception, though: Norway. Of all countries, Europe's big oil exporter is the one that boosting Tesla sales, buoyed by a market that's gone almost entirely electric. Nearly every car sold in Norway in 2025 was an EV, and that rising tide lifted even Tesla's boat. From Reuters:

Almost all new cars registered in Norway last year were fully electric, official data showed on Friday, headed by booming Tesla sales as the Nordic country cements its global lead in phasing out petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.

Oil-producing Norway's rapid switch to battery-powered vehicles contrasts with the rest of Europe, where weak demand for EVs prompted the European Union last month to reverse its planned 2035 ban on internal combustion engine cars.

Driven by tax incentives, 95.9% of all new cars registered in Norway in 2025 were EVs, with that number at almost 98% in December. The annual figure was up from 88.9% in 2024, Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) data showed.

Norway is such an interesting case, because you'd expect such a major oil producer to be big on getting folks into cars that use oil. Turns out the country's pride in its natural beauty wins out, though, and EVs are heavily incentivized.

Germany has a whole market for company-provided cars, and new rules around how much those cars can cost are limiting the market. Enter Zeekr, which hopes to provide a better offering than Germany's own car companies for that specific market. From Automotive News:

Corporate cost ceilings are reshaping Germany's company-car market in ways that favor Chinese EV newcomers over established European brands.

As fleet program bosses impose a top limit of about €60,000 for company car leases while mandating rapid electrification, employees who traditionally pick an Audi or BMW now face a choice: accept lower-spec European EVs or consider Chinese alternatives with better range and features at the same price point.

Geely-owned Zeekr is betting this cost squeeze will overcome German buyers' historical preference for domestic brands. Unlike many Chinese rivals that have focused on retail buyers or rental fleets, Zeekr is prioritizing the corporate car market, particularly higher-margin company vehicles.

I can honestly say that I don't think anyone I know has ever had a company car. I've heard of them, obviously, I know they exist, but I don't think I've ever personally known anyone who's had one. Sounds like they're a much bigger deal over in Germany, if car companies are explicitly targeting them as a pricing strategy.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/teslas-bad-sales-year-means-byd-is-now-the-best-selling-ev-maker-in-the-world/l-intro-1767367731.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 11:59:07.033203

To get there, the Environmental Protection Agency has taken on an unexpected role. Instead of focusing first and foremost on protecting people and the environment, the EPA is increasingly focused on clearing the regulatory path for rapid growth in data centers, chip factories and other AI-related infrastructure.

That shift has created a striking imbalance.

The agency is sprinting in helping companies build the physical backbone of the AI economy but dragging its feet when it comes to using those same powerful tools to improve environmental protection and public health.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has positioned itself as a facilitator for the tech sector and the fossil fuel industry. Reviews of new chemicals are rushed, hurdles lowered for air pollution permits and approvals streamlined, all under the pretext of keeping the U.S. competitive.

The emphasis is clear: move fast.

This deregulatory zeal stands in stark contrast to the agency’s own lethargic embrace of AI to actually improve environmental and public health outcomes for communities across America.

So far, the EPA’s most visible efforts focus on basic office functions, such as sorting and summarizing public comments. These tools may save staff time, but they barely scratch the surface of what AI could do for the agency’s core work.

The same technologies that power large language models could help flag dangerous chemicals earlier, identify pollution hotspots more precisely or focus inspections where problems are most likely to occur. Instead, AI is largely being treated as a productivity aid, not a mission-critical tool.

This isn’t just a missed opportunity — it’s a growing risk. Companies across the economy are rapidly adopting AI to improve efficiency, predict failures and optimize complex systems. If the EPA doesn’t keep pace, it risks becoming a referee who no longer understands the speed of the game. In a fast-moving field, that kind of mismatch matters.

One way forward can be found in the agency’s own past.

Three decades ago, the EPA launched Project XL, an initiative that encouraged companies to try new approaches, as long as they could demonstrate better environmental results. Instead of following rigid rules, participating companies were allowed to experiment with innovative methods that delivered stronger outcomes. The idea was simple: reward better performance, not just box-checking. It was meant to be a new paradigm for environmental regulation and provide a way of moving state-of-the-art technology into the mainstream.

That effort ultimately faded, weighed down by complexity, high costs and concerns about oversight. But the core idea remains sound — and may be even more relevant in the age of AI.

A modern version of Project XL could invite companies to use AI in ways that go beyond minimum expectations. Instead of reacting after problems occur, companies could use predictive tools to prevent them. AI could help fine-tune emissions controls, better match clean energy supply with demand, reduce reliance on backup generators or detect leaks and equipment failures before they become serious. Pilot projects could also show how complex environmental and health data can be made clearer and more accessible to the public, helping communities better understand what’s happening around them.

For the EPA to truly play a constructive role in the AI era, it needs to do more than remove obstacles for industry and cut red tape.

Administrator Zeldin must empower the agency to use AI to defend the environment with the same zeal he applies to cutting the protections that safeguard it and our communities. A carefully designed, next-generation version of that earlier experiment could help the agency learn alongside the private sector, without losing sight of its public purpose.

With global EV sales rising 28 per cent in 2025, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the US rival.

The annual deliveries figure raises questions about whether Tesla can stabilise its core auto business following two consecutive years of sales declines, even as it pivots to futuristic projects such as robotics and self-driving cars to justify its steep valuation.

Tesla shares were marginally up in early trading.

“I think the market remains focused on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin,” said Mr Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

“If deliveries can continue to not be down too much in the coming quarters, I expect market sentiment around the robotaxi will continue to drive the stock,” Mr Goldstein added.

Tesla’s fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in US EV tax credits before they expired at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off.

EV demand has softened in the US since the end of September, when President Donald Trump’s administration ended US$7,500 (S$9,600) federal tax credits.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October–December quarter, down 15.6 per cent from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 per cent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company’s second consecutive annual decline.

Intensifying competition

Analysts have said Tesla came under immense pressure in 2025 in North America and Europe, where competition intensified and the company faced brand backlash due to CEO Elon Musk’s political rhetoric.

Growing competition from Chinese firms and European automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW has weighed on Tesla’s sales momentum.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 per cent from 2024. The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about US$5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

The American company led by Elon Musk logged 418,227 deliveries in the final three months of the year, taking its full-year sales figure to around 1.64 million EVs.

This marked a drop in sales of more than eight percent compared with 2024.

A day prior, BYD said that it sold 2.26 million EVs last year.

Analysts had expected Tesla's sales in the final quarter to slow less, to 449,000, according to a FactSet consensus.

The pullback comes amid the elimination of a $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025, with industry watchers noting it will take time for EV demand to rebalance.

But even before then, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians.

Tesla has also been grappling with rising competition from BYD and other Chinese companies, and from European giants.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, unveiled record EV sales in the past year on Thursday.

Known as ""Biyadi"" in Chinese -- or by the English slogan ""Build Your Dreams"" -- BYD was founded in 1995 and originally specialized in battery manufacturing.

The automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term used to describe various vehicles from fully electric ones to plug-in hybrids. China is the world's largest market for new energy vehicles.

BYD is now looking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.

While BYD and other Chinese EV producers come up against hefty tariffs in the United States, the company's success is picking up in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in Europe.

Tesla only narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with US company's 1.79 million outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.

Nonetheless, Tesla shares ticked up in pre-market trading in New York on Friday.

Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities noted that Tesla's quarterly sales figure remained much better than some had speculated.

He flagged that the company faces a ""more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.""

Ives noted that the company still sees challenges obtaining certain regulatory approval in Europe, with sales potentially rebounding once the regulatory hurdles are cleared.

""Sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe,"" he added.

The awards are given by Plug In America, a national, nonprofit organization that advocates for affordable, accessible EVs and charging stations.

“Though small, Wheatland Electric Cooperative leads with innovation—bridging the gap in rural America and proving no community is too small, too rural, or too remote to be part of the clean transportation future,” the group said in announcing the award.

Since 2021, WEC has installed three ChargePoint® Level 2 public charging stations—with two charging ports each—across an area where no chargers existed within a 100-mile radius. As of October, the stations have supported more than 1,500 charging sessions by nearly 670 different drivers. The co-op created them at its own expense.

“We’re in a part of the country that’s often overlooked, simply because we’re so rural,” said Shajia Donecker, the co-op’s multimedia specialist. “We are always striving to put our region on the EV maps, and I think Plug In America recognized that.”

The co-op also invites community members to test drive EVs at special events, which included a “Dine and Drive” lunch in 2024 in Great Bend that attracted 150 people for a free lunch and a chance to get behind the wheel of three different types of EVs.

The co-op brought its own two electric vehicles—a Hyundai Kona and a Ford F-150 Lightning—and an employe shared his Tesla Model Y. The co-op’s member services team won NRECA’s 2025 Service Excellence Gold Award for creating the “best external event.”

This year, the co-op held “EVs & Espressos” events at or near several local coffee shops, providing free coffee to help entice people to explore EVs as part of National Drive Electric Month.

“Our whole goal is to make EVs more approachable,” said Alli Conine, WEC’s director of member services and corporate communications. “When we give people those hands-on experiences, their perspectives change. We want them to have fun while learning more about EVs.”

EVs are still relatively scarce in the area and no local car dealers display them, making the co-op events the only chance many residents have to test drive an EV, Donecker said.

“We try to meet people where they are,” she said. “You get all kinds of reactions. Some people will say, ‘no, absolutely not, I don’t want anything to do with an EV.’ But you also get, ‘wow, I had no idea how much power an EV has.” About 99% of the time, the reaction is good after they get a chance to drive.”

WEC’s grassroots efforts have focused on EV “accessibility, reliability, and cost savings to resonate locally,” Plug In America said.

“Beyond consumers, Wheatland has provided training and education to first responders, chambers of commerce, and civic leaders. The co-op is also electrifying its fleet, mentoring cooperatives in Kansas and Oklahoma, and providing a replicable playbook for other rural coops across the U.S.”

The company took the unusual step of publishing its own analyst consensus showing an even more pessimistic 15% decline to around 422,850 vehicles. This marks Tesla’s second consecutive year of declining deliveries while the global EV market grew roughly 25%.

Yet Tesla’s stock hit an all-time high on December 16, adding $915 billion in market capitalization in just eight months. The disconnect is the story.

The Numbers Wall Street Is Watching

Two years ago, analysts predicted Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles in 2026. That estimate has collapsed to roughly 1.8 million. The company that once promised 50% annual growth is now bracing for flat to 5% growth at best.

“Investors have fully bought into his autonomous vision, which comes at a good time, as Tesla’s EV business will likely be flat to up 5 percent next year,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told Bloomberg. “At this point, Elon only needs the car business to stabilize over the next year to satisfy investors.”

Read that again. The car business just needs to “stabilize.” Not grow. Not improve. Not compete more aggressively on price. Just hold the line.

What This Means for Buyers

For anyone cross-shopping a Tesla against competitors, this investor-focused strategy has concrete implications. When a company explicitly signals that vehicle sales growth isn’t the priority, don’t expect aggressive pricing moves, significant model refreshes, or urgency to match the competition.

Tesla’s record Q3 deliveries of 497,099 vehicles were built entirely on buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 federal tax credit before it expired September 30. As we documented in November, October EV sales collapsed 24% the moment those incentives disappeared. Tesla responded with its most aggressive incentives ever, including 0% APR financing for 72 months and $0-down leases, essentially self-funding the subsidies taxpayers used to provide.

Those incentives couldn’t fully offset the structural demand shift. And now CEO Elon Musk himself has warned of “a few rough quarters” ahead.

BYD Has Already Won 2025

While Tesla’s sales declined, China’s BYD executed exactly the aggressive expansion we’ve been tracking. BYD confirmed 2.25 million battery-electric vehicle sales in 2025, a 28% increase year-over-year. Tesla’s expected 1.64 million represents an 8% decline.

This marks the first time BYD has outsold Tesla in annual BEV volume. The Chinese automaker had already beaten Tesla for four consecutive quarters heading into Q4, and analysts expect that streak to extend to five.

The contrast is stark: BYD grew 28% while Tesla shrank 8%. One company is fighting for market share with aggressive pricing and new models. The other is telling investors the car business just needs to hold steady.

As we reported last week, Tesla’s European market share has effectively halved in 2025, from 2.2% to 1.3%, while BYD and other Chinese manufacturers captured the customers Tesla lost.

The Robotaxi Bet

Tesla’s valuation now rests almost entirely on autonomous vehicle promises. The company launched an invite-only Robotaxi service in Austin in June with safety operators supervising each ride. Vehicles violated traffic laws on day one, drawing federal investigations, but investors shrugged off the safety concerns.

Tesla’s board proposed a new compensation package for Musk in September potentially worth $1 trillion, tied to milestones including delivering millions of robotaxis. This week, Musk confirmed Tesla has begun testing truly driverless rides in Austin without safety operators.

Meanwhile, California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla’s sales license for 30 days over allegations the company misled consumers about Full Self-Driving capabilities. Tesla has 60 days to rebrand “Autopilot” or face the suspension in its largest U.S. market.

The irony isn’t lost: Tesla’s stock hit all-time highs on autonomous driving promises the same week a judge ruled the company’s marketing of those features was deceptive.

The Bigger Picture: Legacy Automakers Are Retreating

Some Tesla bulls see a silver lining in the post-subsidy chaos. Ford announced a staggering $19.5 billion writedown on December 15, the largest EV-related charge in Detroit history, as it abandons the fully electric F-150 Lightning and kills planned EV models. General Motors took a $1.6 billion charge in October and warned more would follow.

The argument: as legacy automakers retreat from EVs, Tesla and other pure-play EV makers will capture share from a smaller but less contested market.

The counterargument: that smaller market is getting demolished by Chinese competition that isn’t retreating at all. BYD is opening factories in Hungary, Brazil, and Thailand. It’s eating Tesla’s lunch in Europe and dominating China. The retreat of Ford and GM doesn’t mean Tesla wins by default; it means the U.S. cedes the global EV race to China.

EVXL’s Take

I’ve been covering Tesla’s sales decline all year, from Q1’s 9% U.S. drop to October’s three-year China low to Europe’s 39% collapse. This Bloomberg piece crystallizes something that’s been building for months: Tesla has made a strategic choice to prioritize robotaxis and AI over the car business.

For investors betting on autonomous vehicle breakthroughs, that might be the right call. For someone shopping for an EV today, it’s a warning sign.

Here’s what I expect: Tesla’s Q4 numbers will come in around 410,000 to 430,000 units. The company will pivot the narrative entirely to robotaxi progress, FSD adoption rates, and energy storage growth. Vehicle deliveries will be framed as “stabilizing” rather than declining. And the stock will probably go up anyway.

But if you’re a prospective buyer hoping Tesla will respond to BYD’s pricing pressure with more competitive vehicles, this earnings preview is telling you not to hold your breath. The company has explicitly told Wall Street it doesn’t need to sell more cars.

Believe them.

Renters may be eligible for either program with written permission from the property owner, according to the state Energy Office.

While the Energy Office is prepared to select a contractor, it too will remain on hold until federal sign-offs resume.
While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.","South Carolina lawmakers and utility executives have been grappling with how to meet the state’s growing power needs. But the state has been slow to make use of federal programs that aid the energy crunch from another direction — by reducing the amount of power used.

That could change, pending final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy.

South Carolina’s Energy Office is expected to award the operator contract for a pair of consumer rebate programs by Jan. 14, according to a state procurement notice, nearly 3½ years after the passage of the Biden administration’s hallmark clean energy package that funded them.

How long it will take for the state’s $137 million share to go out after the contractor is chosen remains to be seen. The federal energy agency has left other states in limbo for months.

What the programs do

The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program reimburses up to $14,000 to low- and middle-income residents who install high-efficiency electric appliances in their homes.

Another program is available to homeowners of all income levels. The Home Efficiency Rebates program, dubbed HOMES, pays for home improvements. That could include insulating and sealing homes or installing smart thermostats that automatically reduce heating and cooling use during hours when no one is home.

While any homeowner can apply for HOMES, low-income families are allowed the biggest rebates. Caps range from $2,000 to $16,000, depending on applicants’ income and their project’s estimated energy savings.

Renters may be eligible for either program with written permission from the property owner, according to the state Energy Office.

And residents that meet income eligibility, earning no more than one and a half times the area median income for their county, can apply for funding under both programs. To qualify for appliance rebates in Richland County, for example, a household income can’t exceed $139,000. In Charleston County, the income cap is about $166,000. In Greenville County, it’s about $146,000.

South Carolina’s share of the federal funding package is to be split almost evenly between the two programs, according to a database maintained by Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C., climate policy research firm.

Where the programs stand

A handful of states had fully executed contracts and access to funding before President Joe Biden left office. Five states, including North Carolina and Georgia, as well as Washington, D.C., already have both programs in place, according to the database. Seven other states have at least one of the programs in operation.

North Carolina’s programs have been running since Jan. 16, 2025. Georgia started with a pilot program in November 2024 and began full operations in March 2025.

As of Dec. 2, 2025, Georgia had paid out $1.9 million total to 184 households under the appliance-rebate program. Its HOMES program had awarded 684 households a total of $7.1 million, according to the state’s online dashboard.

North Carolina is rolling its programs out one county at a time. As of June 13, the state had received more than 4,100 applications.

But the U.S. Department of Energy has slow-walked a review of Biden-era funding, leaving the remaining 36 states and five territories that applied wondering whether their share of funding will actually come.

South Carolina’s Energy Office started the application process near the end of September 2023, which included opting to participate. Nearly 1½ years later, in mid-January 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy gave the initial funding nod, but the state still had to come up with a plan for how to give those funds out and what to focus the spending on.

Five days later, President Donald Trump took office.

On day one, the president signed an executive order freezing clean energy-related funding in the previous administration’s massive energy and infrastructure laws. This threw the future of the two energy efficiency programs into question, alongside several other initiatives, including grants for solar programs that help low-income communities and funding to expand the availability of public electric vehicle chargers along the U.S. interstate system.

In early June, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told a U.S. House energy panel that his agency’s review was ongoing.

“By the end of this summer or middle of this summer, we are going to have clarity on most of the big projects,” Wright said.

But where the energy efficiency rebates fit into that review is unclear, and nothing appears to have changed since that hearing.

South Carolina joined the queue near the end of July, submitting its plan for final approval.

While the Energy Office is prepared to select a contractor, it too will remain on hold until federal sign-offs resume.

Other programs

As for those other energy-related programs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in August it was terminating a $124 million Solar For All grant won by South Carolina’s Office of Resilience. While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.

The state Office of Resilience was still in its first year of planning when the funding was pulled, so the agency had yet to work out details for spending the grant.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pointed to a provision in Republican’s “One, Big, Beautiful” spending package repealing the fund that housed the money.

​“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program, or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.

The provision applied only to “unobligated” funds, however, and the states suing to hold on to the money argue the environmental agency had awarded all $7 billion of the program’s grant money.

SC can restart electric vehicle charging program after federal funding restored

Court battles also took place earlier in 2025 over electric vehicle charging funds.

The Federal Highway Administration stopped sending out dollars for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, known as NEVI, in February.

Twenty states, the District of Columbia and half a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the paused funding. The money remained on ice until a federal judge, in June, ordered the freeze be lifted.

In August, the highway agency sent notices out to states, letting them know they could reapply.

The agency has since approved South Carolina’s new application.

The state is eligible for about $70 million and will start looking for contractors to build charging stations sometime in 2026, according to the state’s transportation department.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electrician-1024x7681767366436.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=5Yoml9hD,N,,2026-01-02 10:59:24.231030

About Project Starling

Located in Workington, U.K., the Starling project is a first-of-a-kind Power-to-Liquid e-fuel facility, aiming to use Topsoe’s SOEC electrolyzers to produce 25,000 metric tons of e-SAF per year. The project is currently undergoing front-end engineering design (FEED) stage, with construction planned for 2028 and operations targeted for 2031.

Once fully operational, the facility is projected to achieve an 89% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to fossil jet fuel, making a significant contribution to the U.K.’s climate targets.

In July 2025, Project Starling received the largest grant awarded to an e-fuels company, comprising £6 million, out of 17 projects from the U.K. Government Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund Window 3, which aims to accelerate the development of the U.K.’s SAF sector and support delivery of the government’s Jet Zero Strategy and SAF mandate.

About Topsoe’s SOEC technology

Topsoe’s solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC) electrolysis technology is a modular design that operates at significantly higher temperatures compared to other electrolyzer technologies – a tested and proven process that enables industrial-scale production of green hydrogen using renewable electricity. Topsoe’s SOEC electrolyzer produces more hydrogen per unit of power input than alkaline or PEM technologies – achieving around 20% higher efficiency, which can increase to 30% with steam integration – yielding significantly greater hydrogen output. It further allows for the lowest levelized hydrogen cost per megawatt volume, no matter the industry.

Tech giants are building larger data centers not only because of the growing demand for data but also because it's more efficient and cost-effective to build one large data center rather than several small data centers, Asare said.
Residents express fears that data centers will drive up electric bills, which have been soaring in Northwest Indiana and around the nation.
So power prices are going to go up, with data center power growth as a major cause.""
A huge, noisy, visually intrusive data center right next to homes can depress nearby residential values; we’ve seen that concern in fast-growing data center hubs in Virginia and Texas,"" he said.","As data center proposals accelerate across Northwest Indiana, residents are packing council chambers and planning meetings to raise concerns about water use, energy demand, noise and environmental impacts — issues local officials must weigh as developers seek approvals for projects tied to the region’s growing role in the digital economy.

The massive facilities that store, process and transmit digital information are expanding rapidly nationwide to support artificial intelligence, or AI, as well as streaming, e-commerce and cloud services. Northwest Indiana has emerged as an attractive location because of its access to power, water and industrial land, putting local governments on the front lines of decisions that could reshape land use, utility systems and environmental oversight for decades.

Experts say the impacts of data centers can vary widely depending on their design and scale. Many of the largest proposed projects are hyperscale data centers built to support the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, said Isak Nti Asare, executive director of the Indiana University Cybersecurity Clinic. Other types include colocation data centers rented by multiple companies, edge data centers designed to reduce latency, and private facilities that serve individual organizations such as hospitals. Dimitrios Nikolopoulos, the John W. Hancock Professor of engineering at Virginia Tech, whose state is home to one of the country's highest concentrations of data centers in what's become known as Data Center Alley, said data centers aren't one-size-fits-all.

""They range from sprawling hyperscale campuses — think the size of several football fields — to compact, container-sized outdoor installations or enterprise sites. Hyperscale facilities can draw 100 MW or more, comparable to the electricity use of tens of thousands of homes, and can reshape land use, soak up local grid capacity, and place big demands on water supplies,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""On the other end of the spectrum, smaller, distributed 'mini' or outdoor centers can tuck into industrial parks or campus corners, with a lighter physical footprint and more modest infrastructure needs. Personally, I think we should encourage a shift toward many smaller, nimble facilities that sit close to where data is generated and used— not just a handful of mega-farms isolated in the middle of nowhere.""

More data centers are being built to keep up with the demand for e-commerce, streaming, social media, gaming and other uses, Asare said. AI in particular has created more demand at a rapid pace, but more data center capacity is also needed to handle the increased volume of traffic websites like Amazon are getting, he said.

""Data centers are the underlying infrastructure of the digital age,"" Asare said. ""The scale of computing power is increasing so rapidly.""

Tech giants are building larger data centers not only because of the growing demand for data but also because it's more efficient and cost-effective to build one large data center rather than several small data centers, Asare said. Despite price tags that run into hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars to build them, massive data centers reduce the per-unit cost, he said.

The impact on local communities and the environment can vary widely, depending on the size and scope, as well as on how the data center is powered and cooled, Nikolopoulos said.

""When it comes to environmental impact, cooling, power, and siting are the big levers. Air-cooled sites in hot, dry places can gulp down a lot of energy — and often water — while modern liquid or immersion cooling can sharply cut both energy and noise. Companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are already pushing chip-level and liquid-cooling designs that reduce water use and cooling energy for AI data centers,"" Nikolopoulos said.

He added that data centers that combine efficient liquid-cooling systems with renewable energy and are located on already developed industrial land can significantly reduce environmental impacts. Locating near existing substations or industrial zones also means less strain on the grid and less need for new construction, he said.

""We’re also going to see them being more aggressive on-chip cooling, tiny fluid channels built into the silicon, 3D-stacked packages with integrated liquid loops, and phase-change materials near hot spots,"" said Nikolopoulos. ""That helps pull heat directly from the source, so you can pack far more AI compute into each rack while shrinking everything else: size, noise and energy use included.""

How much water and power will data centers use?

Residents have raised concerns that data centers can consume huge quantities of water. Asare said there's wide variation in how much water data centers use, depending largely on design. Data centers that use evaporative methods are a cause for concern, but in most cases the water is discharged after it's used for cooling, he said.

A closed-loop cooling system is ideal, as it ensures all the water is returned to the source, Asare said. Local governments need to look at putting in requirements about water usage during the permitting process, to ensure, for instance, that it's discharged back to the source and not allowed to evaporate, he said.

Data centers use so much water that they can put stress on aquifers, but likely would not do much to drain abundant sources of water like Lake Michigan, Asare said.

Hyperscale data centers can guzzle significant amounts of water, but can be designed to minimize water consumption, Nikolopoulos said.

""Big data centers can be very thirsty — especially those using evaporative cooling in hot climates — but actual water use depends heavily on design and location. A typical large hyperscale facility can consume on the order of a few hundred thousand gallons of water per day for cooling, and some proposed or extreme cases are in the millions of gallons per day, comparable to a town of tens of thousands of people,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""By contrast, air-cooled or closed-loop liquid systems can drive direct cooling water use close to zero in many climates, and Microsoft’s latest designs aim for zero water cooling for AI-heavy sites. Personally, I think any new data center, especially in water-stressed regions, should stick to strict water budgets or go water-free entirely, and smaller, high-density systems make this much more practical.""

A common concern among residents is that data centers will drain groundwater or harm Lake Michigan, the main source of drinking water for the Chicago metro area which is home to around 9.5 million people. Since data centers use water strictly to cool computer servers, the main source of pollution is heat, Asare said. Data centers discharge heated water back into the source, which can adversely affect aquatic life.

Steady discharges can raise temperatures, making it uncomfortable for fish and plant life.

""The biggest worries are about heat and treatment chemicals from cooling systems getting into local water, or pulling so much water that it disrupts local hydrology. Poorly managed facilities could warm rivers or lakes or leak biocides and anti-corrosion chemicals if discharge isn’t tightly controlled,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Around major freshwater bodies like the Great Lakes, some proposed data center projects have raised alarms for their planned withdrawals from sources like Lake Michigan and their potential impacts on already stressed watersheds. In those locations, I’d push for strict regulation, closed-loop or low-water cooling wherever possible, and clear, public monitoring of every withdrawal and discharge. Opting for smaller, modular centers that use little or no water is a much safer bet.""

What do data centers mean for utilities and land use?

Residents who spoke at meetings earlier this year in Starke County said they worry about energy consumption and how data centers could drive up electric bills. Data centers consume vast quantities of power, Asare said. They currently use around 5% of the nation's electricity, a figure that's expected to skyrocket to 12% by 2028, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Data centers often will require new infrastructure, such as new electric power generation and new transmission lines, Asare said. Agreements are needed to ensure the data center operators foot those costs to spare ratepayers, he said. Renewable energy power purchase agreements can require that wind and solar be used to minimize the carbon footprint.

They tend to consume large amounts of energy, due in part to running around the clock 24/7, Asare said.

Large data centers typically require the addition of new electric capacity generation. NIPSCO, for instance, plans to build 3 GW of new capacity to accommodate Amazon Web Services' plans for a major data center campus in Hobart.

""Data centers pack a serious energy punch, and a big facility can quickly drive up local electricity demand if the grid isn’t ready for it. For example, a 100-MW hyperscale campus can use as much power as tens of thousands to around 100,000 households, putting real pressure on regional grids,"" Nikolopoulos said.

High energy usage and new infrastructure costs can be passed on to existing ratepayers, depending on how the data centers are handled.

""My preference? Spread things out with lots of smaller, efficient edge or enterprise centers that fit the local grid, team up with renewables or waste-heat users (for example, feeding heat into district networks), and actively work with utilities,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""That way, they can be flexible, grid-friendly neighbors — not giant, inflexible energy hogs.""

Residents express fears that data centers will drive up electric bills, which have been soaring in Northwest Indiana and around the nation. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports electricity costs have jumped by 7.4% over the past year.

""Data centers are driving increased investment by utilities in generation, transmission and energy storage,"" University of Chicago Professor of Computer Science Andrew A. Chien said. ""These investments must be covered by the ratepayers, and there is also increased competition for power. There are several examples of areas where auctions for future power supplies have already jumped dramatically — showing increases to come. So power prices are going to go up, with data center power growth as a major cause.""

Studies that have not found a correlation between data centers and increased energy bills are flawed, Chien said.

""While done by good researchers, these studies are backward looking and don't accurately capture the macro effects that data center power growth is driving increased power prices,"" he said.

Can communities limit noise and light impacts?

Noise pollution has also been brought before city councils and other local officials. Data centers do generate an audible hum that varies depending on the size, Asare said. Fan, cooling equipment and backup generators all can create noise. Experts say it can be mitigated with shrubbery, building setbacks and other techniques to minimize the effect on neighbors.

Many municipalities have noise regulations that require 45 decibels or fewer at night and could seek to further regulate data centers to ensure they don't disrupt nearby homes or neighborhoods, Asare said.

The volume of noise can vary depending on the size of the data center and it can be mitigated, Nikolopoulos said.

""Traditional air-cooled data centers can be pretty noisy, especially when they’re big and running at full tilt — you’ll often hear a steady low hum from fans and chillers,"" he said. ""This is typically in the 60 to 75 decibel range at the fence line, comparable to loud conversation or busy street noise. But this isn’t inevitable. With smart building design, acoustic barriers and newer cooling methods like direct liquid cooling (which reduces reliance on huge air handlers), noise can be dialed way down. Small, outdoor, or modular centers are even easier to make quiet, as long as noise is treated as a top-tier design constraint from the start.""

Light

Residents, especially those who live in rural areas, have said they worry about light emanating from data centers, including at public hearings in Starke and Porter counties. Security or perimeter lights are not unique to data centers and could be found on any comparable commercial or industrial building, Asare said. Barriers of shrubs and other techniques can be required to shield neighbors. Communities could require warmer colors, mandate motion control or ban stadium-style lighting during the review process, he said.

The lighting is akin to what one might find on a large building like a supermarket, home improvement or big box store, Nikolopoulos said.

""Most of the visible light impact comes from security lighting, not from the servers themselves,"" he said. ""Poorly designed sites can create light pollution that annoys neighbors and confuses wildlife, but this is a very solvable problem. With shielded fixtures, downward-facing LEDs, and smart lighting controls, a data center can be almost invisible after dark — something already implemented at many Nordic and campus-style sites. Smaller, spread-out centers are easier to blend into their surroundings with thoughtful lighting than massive, highly visible campuses.""

What is the impact on property values?

Hammond residents earlier this year expressed worry about data centers sinking property values. Asare said data centers could affect the resaleability of a home if it was close enough, but would not necessarily affect the value, merely the perception among some buyers. Having one in the community could end up being a boon for property values if it resulted in more tech companies and jobs, increasing the economic opportunity in town, he said.

Nikolopoulos said it comes down to location, location, location.

""Property values depend a lot on context. A huge, noisy, visually intrusive data center right next to homes can depress nearby residential values; we’ve seen that concern in fast-growing data center hubs in Virginia and Texas,"" he said. ""Put the same facility in an industrial or commercial zone with good buffers and design, and it can have neutral or even positive effects through job creation and a stronger tax base. Personally, I think the smart move is to keep the very large sites away from neighborhoods and focus on smaller, human-scale edge or enterprise centers that fit naturally into mixed-use or commercial areas.""

How will data centers affect nearby neighborhoods?

Residents also fear new development will disrupt wildlife habitats, driving out deer, turtles, birds and other fauna. The four homeowners who sued to block data centers in Hobart specifically raised concerns about migrating birds and families of deer that frequent their properties. Data centers could fragment habitats, but no more than any other massive development would, Asare said. The night lighting could affect nocturnal species like owls, birds could vary their migration patterns and discharges could affect heat levels, affecting aquatic life.

Locating data centers in already developed areas instead of greenfield sites can help preserve habitats for flora and fauna, Nikolopoulos said. Data centers in Scandinavia minimize impact on the natural environment with careful siting, low-noise cooling and dark-sky lighting.

""Wildlife feels the effects of data centers mostly through land conversion, noise, heat, light, and water use,"" he said. ""Building a large campus on undeveloped land can fragment habitats and disrupt migration routes. By contrast, compact, modular centers sited on already-developed sites — parking lots, brownfields, rooftops, or former industrial properties — cause very little additional habitat loss.""

Water stewardship in pharmaceutical operations Access to clean water remains fundamental to both public health outcomes and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.","The pharmaceutical sector faces mounting pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility alongside clinical innovation.

As healthcare systems worldwide grapple with the dual challenges of expanding access and reducing carbon footprints, pharmaceutical manufacturers are increasingly recognising that patient outcomes cannot be separated from planetary health.

Merck (known as MSD in the UK) exemplifies this shift in thinking.

The global healthcare and pharmaceutical company is working to align its net-zero commitments with its core mission of improving patient care.

""Our purpose to save and improve lives is inextricably linked to fostering a healthy planet. It is why we embed our commitment to enabling a safe, sustainable and healthy future within our Corporate Strategic Framework,"" says the company.

Renewable energy in healthcare manufacturing

Healthcare manufacturing requires significant energy inputs, from maintaining sterile production environments to powering cold chain logistics for biologics and vaccines.

Merck is addressing this challenge by reducing energy demand whilst simultaneously increasing renewable energy use.

The company's renewable footprint is expanding through Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), long-term contracts that help bring new clean energy projects online.

Over the past five years, Merck has secured 209 megawatts (MW) of VPPA commitments across North America (118 MW) and Europe (91 MW), with its second US VPPA beginning operation in 2024 and a new solar project in Spain commencing in the second quarter of 2025.

""Our long-standing commitment and focus on advancing access to health, operating responsibly and implementing strategies that protect the health of people, animals and the planet is unwavering,"" says Robert M. Davis, Chairman and CEO of Merck.

""As we continue to navigate the rapid pace of change happening all around us, I am proud of the progress we've made thus far and I remain optimistic about our future.""

Merck has committed to sourcing 100% of purchased electricity from renewable energy by 2025 and has reached 61% to date.

The organisation is working towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across global operations by 2045, aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative, supported by more than 400 supplier partnerships.

As of late 2024, Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 16% below its 2019 baseline, while Scope 3 emissions were 6% below baseline, with a target of a 30% reduction by 2030.

Water stewardship in pharmaceutical operations

Access to clean water remains fundamental to both public health outcomes and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.

""Water is a key input to our manufacturing operations and we assess water risk throughout our network as a standard business practice,"" says Merck.

The company's global water strategy supports United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 on clean water and sanitation.

This includes ensuring wastewater discharges meet local and national standards, understanding and controlling its operational water footprint, managing water risk at facilities and within the supply chain and reporting publicly on water use and goals.

Merck's Water Management Standard requires sites to comply with relevant regulations, minimise discharge-related impacts and identify water reduction opportunities.

Reduction measures include integrating water considerations into process design, optimising cooling systems, recovering and reusing steam condensate and 'reject water' for non-potable applications and optimising process water purification systems.

Biodiversity protection and healthcar

Merck recognises that protecting and restoring nature and biodiversity is essential to a healthy planet and the company's long-term growth because nature provides critical ecosystem services such as air and water purification and genetic resources for medicines.

The company supports biodiversity by monitoring species, improving its understanding of wild populations, survival rates and migration patterns.

Merck also aids in providing medicines, vaccines and technologies that advance aquaculture and conservation, alongside solutions that protect species ranging from salmon and sturgeon to sea turtles, penguins and bats.

Over the past eight years, Merck has invested annually in habitat restoration and reforestation projects linked to its UN CEO Water Mandate Commitment, working with partners such as The Nature Conservancy and One Tree Planted.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/332efb18e0661afdf153e9545dbbc90e:61fa549e32a18fbcacb4640bbf0a7bf6/msd-main.webp.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:59:17.361797

The company was also out-sold by China-based chief rival BYD, which is likely the biggest seller of EVs for 2025

Tesla's rough year took it to its second straight annual sales decline.

Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker on Friday posted deliveries well below Wall Street's already-low expectations.

Austin, Texas-based Tesla (TSLA) said it delivered 418,227 vehicles to customers between October and December, compared with the 440,000 expected by Wall Street, according to FactSet estimates. Earlier this week, the company published a consensus of sell-side analyst expectations that forecast 422,850 units sold. Compared with a year earlier, Tesla's December quarter sales dropped 16%.

For 2025, Tesla's sold 1.63 million vehicles, falling short of the 1.78 million vehicles it delivered in 2024 and the 1.8 million sold in 2023. It's the company's second straight annual decline. When Tesla in 2024 failed to match its 2023 performance, it was the company's first year-over-year sales drop since 2011.

On Thursday, Tesla rival BYD said its sales of battery electric vehicles rose 27% to 2.25 million, while plug-in hybrid car sales fell 7% to 2.25 million. The Chinese automaker's unaudited results would make it the biggest global seller of battery-powered vehicles for 2025.

Earlier: China's BYD just raised the bar on EV sales. Tesla may struggle to catch up.

Tesla shares were up by almost 2% in premarket trading after the company's sales announcement.

Tesla sold 406,585 Model Y sport-utility vehicles and Model 3 sedans, which overwhelmingly account for the bulk of its sales, last quarter. The company also sold 11,642 other vehicles, which it groups together when reporting deliveries. That includes the Model X SUV, Model S sedan and Cybertruck pickup truck.

Last year saw Tesla struggle in Europe after consumers rejected the company, largely over Musk's embrace of far-right political figures. It's also been losing market share to expanding Chinese automakers scooping up market share in Europe and China.

Sales in the U.S. got a boost in the third quarter as consumers took advantage of tax credits that expired at the end of September. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, estimates that added 55,000 deliveries to Tesla's record quarter that would have otherwise been spread through the following two quarters.

Analysts expect U.S. electric car sales to be slightly weaker over the next few quarters as affordability remains a barrier for some consumers to purchase EVs. That will impact EV sellers across the industry, although some expect Tesla to ultimately benefit.

""Only brands with strong products, cost discipline, and loyalty are positioned to keep/gain [market] share. That's a good thing for Tesla,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in Dec. 22 note to investors.

Despite the company's focus on artificial-intelligence, the EV business still accounts for the majority of Tesla's revenue. Analysts expect Tesla to report $70.8 billion in automotive revenue for 2025, down from $77 billion a year earlier, according to FactSet estimates.

Tesla on Friday also said it delivered a record 14.2 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in the December quarter, showing the growth of its energy business. Its previous record was set in the third quarter of 2025, when it deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage products.

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla’s rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

Global electricity demand is now rising far faster than overall energy consumption.
As Birol noted, electricity demand growth, rooted for decades in household appliances, industrial processes, and air conditioning, is now being accelerated by “artificial intelligence, air conditioners, and electric cars driving further the global electricity demand growth.” However, the scale of the shift is unprecedented.
While electricity still accounts for roughly 20% of global final energy use, it already “supplies energy to more than 40% of the global economy,” he said.
“The electricity demand growth is 10,000 TWh—the electricity that is consumed today in the U.S., Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, all advanced economies, combined.","IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2025 shows the global power system entering the “Age of Electricity,” with demand accelerating faster than grids, reshaping fuel mixes, investment flows, and energy security priorities.

The world has firmly crossed into the “Age of Electricity.” That is a unifying finding in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) 2025 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO), which shows a global power sector being reshaped simultaneously by surging demand, a geographic pivot in consumption, record solar manufacturing capacity, a wave of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export development, heightened energy security concerns, and a widening gap between generation deployment and grid readiness.

1. The Age of Electricity. As IEA Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol observed at the report’s launch, the shift reflects the sector’s rapid pivot away from a period dominated by fossil fuel price volatility and post-pandemic overcapacity toward structurally accelerating electricity demand. For years, “IEA has been saying that the electricity demand is growing very strongly among all the fuels, and recently we said the world may enter the age of electricity, and looking at the data today in the WEO I think we can comfortably say that the age of electricity has arrived,” Birol said.

Global electricity demand is now rising far faster than overall energy consumption. Demand has already increased near 3% per year over the past decade, almost twice the growth rate of total energy demand, and accelerated to more than 4% in 2024. Under the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)—which reflects current and announced government policies (without assuming future targets are achieved)—electricity consumption expands by nearly 1,000 TWh annually through 2035, driven by growing industrial electrification, rising appliance ownership, expanding cooling demand, electric vehicles (EVs), and data center growth. As Birol noted, electricity demand growth, rooted for decades in household appliances, industrial processes, and air conditioning, is now being accelerated by “artificial intelligence, air conditioners, and electric cars driving further the global electricity demand growth.”

However, the scale of the shift is unprecedented. While electricity still accounts for roughly 20% of global final energy use, it already “supplies energy to more than 40% of the global economy,” he said. IEA Director of Sustainability, Technology, and Outlooks Laura Cozzi further underscored the cumulative magnitude: “Electricity demand growth from now to 2035 is nearly identical in our STEPS and [Current Policies Scenario (CPS)],” which sets out a pathway for the future of the energy system in which there is no change in energy-related policies scenarios, she said. “The electricity demand growth is 10,000 TWh—the electricity that is consumed today in the U.S., Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, all advanced economies, combined. That’s added in just 10 years. This is a very, very big shift that will demand a lot of investment and planning.”

2. Geographic Pivot—China to India, Southeast Asia. However, the report suggests the global center of electricity demand growth is shifting decisively away from China toward India and Southeast Asia, driven by stark demographic divergence and evolving consumption patterns. “China has reached a peak in population, and we are expecting that by 2035, China will have around 50 million people less than today, reaching the type of demographic structure that we see in advanced economies such as Japan or Italy,” Cozzi said. At the same time, she noted, “We are seeing this passing of the baton to other emerging economies—to India and Southeast Asia, where we receive 230 million more people living there.” The consumer transition is already evident: “Over 50% of car sales in the next decade will happen in emerging and developing economies outside of China—a very profound shift compared to the past decade where this was happening in China.”

Investment flows, however, remain uneven. In the U.S., enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has tightened foreign-content rules and revised tax credits affecting clean power, carbon capture, EVs, efficiency programs, and critical minerals. Globally, total energy investment reached $3.3 trillion in 2025 (more than 20% greater than 2015 levels) and is now roughly two-thirds directed toward low-emissions technologies, primarily driven by energy security concerns. Yet most capital remains concentrated in China, the U.S., and Europe, while Africa and Latin America continue to lag despite accelerating demand. Southeast Asia, notably, stands out as a fast-emerging growth pole, with electricity consumption rising 7% to 1,300 TWh in 2024 and projected to reach 2,100 TWh by 2035, driving new generation additions across natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and storage.

3. Reshaping the Electricity Mix—All Fuels in Transition. The global power-generation mix is undergoing a rapid structural shift across all fuel types. Under the IEA’s STEPS (Figure 1), the share of fossil fuels in electricity is slated to fall from about 60% in 2024 to below 40% by 2035, and to just 20% by mid-century. Renewables, now roughly one-third of global generation, surpass 50% by 2035 and exceed two-thirds by 2050, driven primarily by wind and solar, whose combined share rises from 15% today to 40% by 2035 and 55% by 2050.

Nuclear will maintain a steady share—just under 10% of global generation—supported by uprates, plant restarts, and new construction, particularly in the U.S., France, and Japan. After two decades of stagnation, global nuclear capacity is projected to expand by at least one-third by 2035, with more than 70 GW currently under construction worldwide, among the highest build rates in 30 years. In advanced economies, nuclear accounts for nearly 10% of incremental electricity demand growth to 2035, while generation in emerging market and developing economies is expected to roughly double over the same period as countries look to firm low-emissions supply alongside variable renewables.

The report suggests, crucially, that in advanced economies, low-emissions power generation could grow about 50% faster than electricity demand through 2035, while in emerging economies (where power demand is slated to climb roughly 50% over the period), low-emissions sources could expand even faster. China accounts for two-thirds of the increase. Coal remains the most significant single power source in developing markets by 2035, despite declining utilization, while gas-fired generation continues to grow to provide flexible capacity.

Still, solar is slated to remain the dominant growth technology within that transition. “Solar is going to play a pivotal role here,” Birol said. “Big growth coming from solar. It is also important to see that the bulk of electricity demand growth will come from countries where we see a huge amount of solar radiation—solar-rich countries.” Solar supplies about 60% of incremental demand growth across emerging economies, but integration challenges are mounting. “Curtailment of wind and solar output is on the rise, as are incidences of negative pricing in wholesale markets, but slow permitting is holding back grid projects,” he said. At the same time, supply chains are outpacing deployment: “In 2024, there was sufficient manufacturing capacity to have produced more than twice as many solar PV modules as were actually deployed, and almost three times as many battery cells.”

4. Gas Power’s Resurgence—and the LNG Wave. The global natural gas market, meanwhile, is being reshaped both by record LNG investment and by a sharp rebound in gas-fired power generation across fast-growing electricity regions. As IEA Chief Energy Economist Tim Gould noted, “2025 has been a really remarkable year for approvals of new LNG export facilities. This year we’ve seen almost 100 billion cubic meters [Bcm] worth of new export projects approved—just short of the all-time record we saw in 2019.” He added, “If we stack up all of those existing and new projects from the U.S., Qatar, Canada, and elsewhere, we have 300 billion cubic meters of new capacity coming onto the market.”

Bolstering the build-out is rapidly rising demand for gas-fired electricity. In emerging Asia alone, about 35% of incremental natural gas demand through 2035 comes from the power sector, supporting nearly 270 GW of new gas generation capacity—an increase of about 70% over current levels. China is slated to add roughly 200 Bcm of new demand, while India could nearly double it to 140 Bcm by 2035, driven largely by power generation and city-gas expansion. The Middle East contributes another 240 Bcm of demand growth linked primarily to electricity and industrial use. LNG has already overtaken pipelines as the dominant mode of long-distance gas trade, with supply flows increasingly aimed at these growth markets.

Lower prices will help to bring gas into markets like India, where imports double to 2030, and Southeast Asia, where they triple, Gould said. Still, “That is not enough to absorb all of the new LNG that’s coming to market in the STEPS,” Gould warned. He added, “There’s really ample potential for more coal-to-gas switching, but the sorts of prices you would need to make that switch an economic proposition are very difficult for LNG exporters to match.”

5. Energy Security & Critical Minerals. The WEO finds energy security now extends beyond fuel supply to the mineral and technology supply chains essential to modern power systems. In 2024, 91% of rare earth element refining occurred in a single country, and even if all planned projects are completed, that share would fall only to 75% by 2035. China remains the dominant refiner for 19 of 20 strategic energy minerals, while the top three producers control an average 86% of global refining capacity, creating growing vulnerability across clean-energy supply chains.

“Even if we assume that all projects that are planned or under construction are implemented successfully, this 91% goes only to 75% in 10 years—still a very big concentration in one country,” Birol warned. As electrification accelerates worldwide, he added, “Energy security is now similar at the same level as economic security and national security in many cases.”

6. System Integration & Flexibility. Finally, as generation capacity surges worldwide, grid investment and system flexibility are struggling to keep pace. “Investments in electricity generation have charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015 to reach $1 trillion per year, but annual grid spending has risen at less than half the pace to $400 billion,” the WEO notes. Operational friction is mounting, it suggests. Growing curtailment and negative pricing signal widening system integration constraints, while accelerating battery deployment addresses short-term needs but remains insufficient to meet rising seasonal flexibility requirements.

And, while storage is scaling rapidly, it remains only a partial solution. “Battery storage additions rose to more than 75 GW in 2024, but batteries cannot provide all the answers—especially where seasonal flexibility needs rise alongside short-term ones.” Additional flexibility is expected from consumers: “Demand response activation grows more than threefold by 2035, driven by participation from buildings and transport sectors through smart air conditioners, heat pumps, and EVs.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lightbulb-pixabay-1024x683.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:58:52.951364

Tax credits and financing Helene costs will help mitigate energy bill changes beginning in 2026

GREENVILLE, S.C., Jan. 2, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Beginning in January, Duke Energy will implement changes to customer bills that reflect investments made to recover from the historic damage from Hurricane Helene, strengthen the grid against storms and outages, maintain and upgrade its power generating fleet, and serve a growing customer base while supporting economic growth in South Carolina.

Our view: ""Duke Energy is committed to meeting the expectations our customers have around reliability, responsiveness and value – striking the right balance that delivers these at the lowest possible cost for customers,"" said Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president. ""That means investing in what matters, delivering results efficiently, and remaining transparent about what customers are paying for and why.""

The Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) recently approved these updates for customers of Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), the company's two utilities in the state.

Recovering from Helene: Securitization – selling low-interest, long-term bonds – is one way Duke Energy can generate savings and keep costs lower for customers while also recovering large and unexpected expenses like those that resulted from Hurricane Helene. The PSCSC recently approved a securitization plan that will save DEC customers more than $140 million on Helene expenses.

Beginning in January, a typical residential DEC customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month will see a new storm charge on bills reflecting a 3.2% increase, or $4.58. This modest increase still delivers 20% savings for customers over the recovery period compared to traditional cost recovery methods.

""We appreciate the legislature providing tools like securitization to address extreme storm costs as we continue to pursue ways to reduce these impacts on customer bills,"" Pearson said.

Powering growth, driving reliability: Duke Energy has made investments in the things our customers expect: upgrades to strengthen the grid, improve reliability and storm resilience, and maintain and upgrade our generation fleet. These investments are already in place and delivering benefits to South Carolina, from faster restoration times to improved reliability and operational efficiency.

For example, as part of ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has nearly tripled the number of South Carolina customers served by self-healing technology over the past two years, with more than 70% of customers now benefiting from this innovative automated power restoration tool.

""Meeting the needs of our customers means prioritizing investments that enhance the grid while also minimizing the cost impact for customers,"" Pearson said. ""For example, Duke Energy's nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual tax credits in the coming years – savings that will be passed to our customers beginning in 2026.""

Bottom line: The PSCSC recently approved comprehensive agreements between diverse groups of stakeholders that will apply these tax credits to bills and include shareholder-funded contributions to residential customers, helping to mitigate the impacts of recent infrastructure investments on customer bills over the next two years.

DEP: Beginning Feb. 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEP residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $11.20 a month – from $153.82 per month to $165.02.

DEC: Beginning March 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEC residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $0.84 a month – from $148.02 per month to $148.86 (this includes the securitization charge previously mentioned).

DEC serves about 680,000 households and businesses primarily in Upstate and north central South Carolina, including Greenville, Anderson and York counties, while DEP serves about 177,000 customers in the Pee Dee region and northeastern South Carolina, including Sumter, Florence and Darlington counties. If approved by regulators in 2026, the proposed combination of the two utilities would save customers in the Carolinas more than $1 billion in future costs.

Helping customers manage costs: ""Customers expect us to manage our costs, but they also want options to manage their own energy usage and give them tools to impact their own bills,"" Pearson said. ""That's why we're helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.""

Across the Carolinas, Duke Energy's aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. Improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system. In South Carolina, the company recently increased the incentives of many of these programs, expanding ways customers can save money.

Why should I care?

For markets: The future story is strong but the car business sets the math.

Tesla shares were up about 11% in 2025 despite weaker deliveries, suggesting investors are putting more weight on robotaxis, self-driving software, and robotics than on near-term EV sales. But repeated delivery declines typically mean more discounting, which can compress margins and make earnings more sensitive to volume. The key question for markets is whether Tesla can stabilize its core auto demand without permanently training customers to wait for the next price cut.

Zooming out: Subsidies don’t just boost sales they reshape them.

The Q3 pull-forward and Q4 hangover show how policy can shift demand across quarters, then leave a tougher baseline once incentives vanish. When that happens, automakers often choose between slowing production or cutting prices to keep factories busy – neither is great for profitability. Over time, fewer incentives also forces the sector to compete more on price, features, and brand strength, raising the pressure on weaker lineups.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2026_newsml_L4N3Y30E1_279960018.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=136f104b39b5a9c6b64096c4d076f21f,N,,2026-01-02 09:58:57.061173

Conservation groups and legislators alike are looking to take another bite of the apple on several $50-million bond issues and settle emerging issues with wastewater sludge at the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill in Old Town when lawmakers convene again this month.

As in 2025, the mitigation of “forever chemicals” is at the forefront of many 2026 legislative proposals, along with support for the wastewater treatment facilities that confront them daily.

Several forestry industry advocates are also hoping that the Legislature affirms its support of Maine loggers and provides them financial relief amid challenging market conditions.

Conservation and infrastructure funding

— L.D. 362: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Replenish the Land for Maine’s Future Program

Lead sponsor Sen. Russell Black (R-Wilton) is proposing a $50 million bond to replenish Maine’s conservation program and help purchase high-value agricultural land, critical wildlife habitat and public access points to Maine’s coast.

Without this bond, Maine will lose even more land to development, taking the state’s dwindling rural workforce of farmers along with it, Black wrote in legislative testimony.

“As a farmer and a fiscal conservative, I believe we should only spend taxpayer dollars when it’s absolutely necessary and when it delivers real, lasting value — and protecting Maine’s farmland does just that,” Black said.

— L.D. 836: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrade Municipal Culverts at Stream Crossings

Another bill — this time from Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) — would dedicate a $50 million bond to Maine municipalities looking to replace or expand their aging, undersized culverts that channel water under or around roads.

Culverts can be an achilles heel for municipalities facing heavy rainstorms and floods. Roads blow out when they’re overwhelmed and undermined, stranding residents trying to evacuate. Improving culverts would both mitigate flood risks and help aquatic wildlife travel from stream to stream, Daughtry wrote in testimony.

— L.D. 25: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund Wastewater Treatment Facility Planning and Construction of Infrastructure Projects

Another $50 million bond measure from Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Scarborough) is for municipal and quasi-municipal wastewater treatment plants to purchase equipment that would help reduce the amount of wastewater sludge or biosolids they produce.

This is the scum that gets filtered out during wastewater treatment and often contains forever chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Maine municipalities often truck that waste to landfills such as Juniper Ridge in Old Town for burial and disposal.

“This will save landfill space, reduce the volume and weight of sludge when it is transported … and will make sludge easier to handle,” wrote Melanie Loyzim, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.

— L.D. 1904: An Act to Establish the Municipal Shoreline Protection Legal Fund

This bill from Sen. Senator Tim Nangle (D-Windham) has a smaller price tag — a minimum of $100,000 — and would build on Nangle’s prior legislation to help municipalities hold developers responsible for damage to fragile shoreline habitat.

The fund would help municipalities pay for legal action against violators of shoreline zoning restrictions and would be reimbursed if the municipalities win in court.

Climate priorities

— L.D. 1870: An Act to Establish a Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program to Impose Penalties on Climate Polluters

This bill from lead sponsor Brenner would charge fossil fuel companies operating during a certain timespan and emitting a certain amount of greenhouse gases for some costs of Maine climate adaptation projects. It prompted more than 100 letters of testimony when it was introduced last May and has been carried over into the second half of the legislative session.

Other Democratic-led states have introduced similar “climate superfund” bills — 11 total, according to Grist — but only New York and Vermont have been successful. They’ve been mired in legal challenges ever since.

Forest products industry relief

— L.D. 1313: An Act to Promote Equity in the Forest Products Industry by Allowing Commercial Wood Haulers to Be Eligible for Certain Sales Tax Exemptions and Refunds

Spearheaded by Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Norridgewock), L.D. 1313 would provide relief for one link in the forest products industry’s broader supply chain: a sales tax refund or exemption on the purchase of logging equipment and vehicles, from semitrucks to the long-armed machines that cut and haul timber. It would result in an estimated loss in tax revenue to the state of $269,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027, with slightly increasing losses in the years after.

“It’s on the special appropriations table, and, honestly, that one has such a painfully small fiscal note, it would be great if we could get that one to move,” Krysta West, executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council, told The Maine Monitor.

Maine’s multi-billion dollar forest products industry has been hit by inflation, falling market prices for certain timber products, tariffs on logging equipment and an overall decline in manufacturing.

— L.D. 798: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund Mass Timber Manufacturing

L.D. 798 proposes another $50 million bond that would boost the manufacturing side of Maine’s forest products sector. The bill from Rep. Samuel Lewis Zager (D-Portland) would finance the creation or retrofitting of manufacturing equipment that produces refined timber products such as wood paneling and construction materials.

‘Forever chemicals’ and drinking water

— L.D. 1696: Resolve, to Study Maine’s Absolute Dominion and Beneficial Use Laws Relating to Water Rights

Recurring drought over the past five years has prompted concern about the health of Maine’s aquifers and underwater reserves, especially in relation to the impact of large-scale water extractors such as Poland Spring.

Lead sponsor Rep. Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) told attendees of a Maine Conservation Voters meeting last week that she hopes this bill will study how other states are regulating their water and create actionable policy proposals for Maine.

“We need to really have an examination of what our legal framework is for water,” Gramlich said.

— L.D. 1177: Resolve, to Study the Public Health and Environmental Risks from Synthetic Turf

A second study proposal from Gramlich directs the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to study the health impacts of synthetic or artificial turf on humans, with specific concern about their use of forever chemicals.

The bill needs $100,000 in funding. Gramlich said she was working with state officials to try to lower that price tag.",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/statehouse-building-closeup.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 10:59:37.256358

Tax credits and financing Helene costs will help mitigate energy bill changes beginning in 2026

GREENVILLE, S.C. – Beginning in January, Duke Energy will implement changes to customer bills that reflect investments made to recover from the historic damage from Hurricane Helene, strengthen the grid against storms and outages, maintain and upgrade its power generating fleet, and serve a growing customer base while supporting economic growth in South Carolina.

Our view: “Duke Energy is committed to meeting the expectations our customers have around reliability, responsiveness and value – striking the right balance that delivers these at the lowest possible cost for customers,” said Tim Pearson, Duke Energy’s South Carolina president. “That means investing in what matters, delivering results efficiently, and remaining transparent about what customers are paying for and why.”

The Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) recently approved these updates for customers of Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), the company’s two utilities in the state.

Recovering from Helene: Securitization – selling low-interest, long-term bonds – is one way Duke Energy can generate savings and keep costs lower for customers while also recovering large and unexpected expenses like those that resulted from Hurricane Helene. The PSCSC recently approved a securitization plan that will save DEC customers more than $140 million on Helene expenses.

Beginning in January, a typical residential DEC customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month will see a new storm charge on bills reflecting a 3.2% increase, or $4.58. This modest increase still delivers 20% savings for customers over the recovery period compared to traditional cost recovery methods.

“We appreciate the legislature providing tools like securitization to address extreme storm costs as we continue to pursue ways to reduce these impacts on customer bills,” Pearson said.

Powering growth, driving reliability: Duke Energy has made investments in the things our customers expect: upgrades to strengthen the grid, improve reliability and storm resilience, and maintain and upgrade our generation fleet. These investments are already in place and delivering benefits to South Carolina, from faster restoration times to improved reliability and operational efficiency.

For example, as part of ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has nearly tripled the number of South Carolina customers served by self-healing technology over the past two years, with more than 70% of customers now benefiting from this innovative automated power restoration tool.

“Meeting the needs of our customers means prioritizing investments that enhance the grid while also minimizing the cost impact for customers,” Pearson said. “For example, Duke Energy’s nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual tax credits in the coming years – savings that will be passed to our customers beginning in 2026.”

Bottom line: The PSCSC recently approved comprehensive agreements between diverse groups of stakeholders that will apply these tax credits to bills and include shareholder-funded contributions to residential customers, helping to mitigate the impacts of recent infrastructure investments on customer bills over the next two years.

DEP: Beginning Feb. 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEP residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $11.20 a month – from $153.82 per month to $165.02.

DEC: Beginning March 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEC residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $0.84 a month – from $148.02 per month to $148.86 (this includes the securitization charge previously mentioned).

DEC serves about 680,000 households and businesses primarily in Upstate and north central South Carolina, including Greenville, Anderson and York counties, while DEP serves about 177,000 customers in the Pee Dee region and northeastern South Carolina, including Sumter, Florence and Darlington counties. If approved by regulators in 2026, the proposed combination of the two utilities would save customers in the Carolinas more than $1 billion in future costs.

Helping customers manage costs: “Customers expect us to manage our costs, but they also want options to manage their own energy usage and give them tools to impact their own bills,” Pearson said. “That’s why we’re helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.”

Across the Carolinas, Duke Energy’s aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. Improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system. In South Carolina, the company recently increased the incentives of many of these programs, expanding ways customers can save money.

“The power industry supply chain has retracted because power build-out in the U.S. has been so minimal for so long.","From artificial intelligence-driven efficiency to transmission bottlenecks, power industry insiders share their perspectives on the opportunities and obstacles shaping 2026 and beyond.

The power generation sector enters 2026 at a critical inflection point. Electricity demand is surging—driven by data centers, manufacturing reshoring, and transportation electrification—even as the industry navigates an unprecedented transformation in how power is generated, transmitted, and consumed. Utilities and independent power producers face the dual challenge of maintaining grid reliability while transitioning to cleaner energy sources, all amid regulatory uncertainty and shifting market dynamics.

This year promises to be pivotal for decisions that will shape the industry’s trajectory for decades. From the continued buildout of renewable capacity to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into grid management, 2026 will test the sector’s ability to balance innovation with pragmatism.

AI Enhances Efficiency

“The grid will become even more AI-enabled in the next year as AI becomes necessary for utilities to be more efficient,” Pradeep Tagare, head of Investments with National Grid Partners, told POWER. “In our recent Utility Innovation Survey, we saw this in real time: utilities are no longer treating AI as ‘nice to have,’ but rather as a strategic tool to manage load growth, enable reliability, and accelerate grid expansion. Due to the pressures that the electrification of heating, transport, and data center expansion place on the grid, AI-driven forecasting, risk mitigation, and infrastructure planning tools will become essential.”

Albert Hofeldt, Chief Product Officer with Power Factors, said optimization has always been a priority for renewable energy operators, but it has taken on a new significance over the past few years. “Returns for renewable energy projects are shrinking, a sign of our current economic context and a signal of maturity for the market. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of capital, while financial support from state and federal governments disappear, pushing costs back onto developers. The renewable energy market is mature enough now to handle these changes, but it increases the pressure to build a bulletproof business model. In many cases, renewable energy companies are realizing that improving production and reducing future costs can actually deliver a greater and safer return over time than a new development,” he told POWER.

“Machine learning and AI have a big role to play in increasing production from existing assets,” Hofeldt added. “AI can predict issues with underperforming assets earlier, making it possible to conduct maintenance with less downtime, ultimately maximizing energy production and revenue. It can also identify the root cause of underperformance, helping operators prioritize issues quickly and plan maintenance so that the highest-impact fixes are done first.”

How Much Power Will AI Demand

While AI is rapidly becoming indispensable for optimizing grid efficiency and predictive maintenance, this very success is fueling a new massive challenge, that is, meeting the unprecedented increase in power demand that is predicted from the data centers that house AI infrastructure.

“For years, the conversation was about gradual electrification,” Sonya Montgomery, CEO of The Desoto Group, told POWER, referring to electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps, as examples of the slow but steady shift. “Recently, however, the need to find gigawatts, not megawatts, almost overnight due to AI-computing demands is something the industry must adapt to.”

A report published in December 2024 by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy projected total data center energy use through 2028. Researchers presented a range of estimates to reflect various scenarios. Their low- and high-end projections were roughly 325 TWh and 580 TWh in 2028, which represented 6.7% to 12.0% of total U.S. electricity consumption forecasted that year. However, since that time, new developments have put in question almost all estimates of future data center energy demand.

“The DeepSeek R1 model release was probably the most pivotal point in 2025,” Ryan Luther, director of Energy Transition Research with Enverus, reflected. “It made the entire market second guess the load growth from data centers.”

Developed by Chinese startup DeepSeek, R1 is a powerful open-source reasoning model known for its high performance in coding and mathematics at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. DeepSeek R1’s efficiency breakthrough showed that algorithmic innovation could drastically reduce the energy footprint per AI task, casting doubt on the exponential power-growth curves currently driving data center planning.

“I think we will continue to see moments like that in 2026 that will have major impacts on the outlook for power markets,” Luther continued. “For instance, Meta is clearly losing the AI race and wasting hundreds of billions pursuing it. If they don’t turn it around quickly, they might have to abandon the endeavor. That would cut a fifth of the data center build-out and reset expectations on power demand growth.”

Utility-Scale Solar Surges On

Regardless of what happens with data center demand, solar photovoltaic (PV) technology will remain the powerhouse of the energy transition (Figure 1). Its unprecedented growth will continue to reshape power markets in 2026 and beyond.

“Renewables and storage will continue to do the bulk of the heavy lifting,” said Peter Davidson, CEO and co-founder of Aligned Climate Capital. “Solar, wind, and batteries are the fastest, cheapest, most scalable way to add firm power—and anyone who thinks otherwise is clinging to an outdated narrative.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects in its Renewables 2025 report, which was released in October, that solar will account for about 80% of the total increase in global renewable power capacity over the next five years. It estimates about 3.68 TW of solar capacity will be added by 2030. This is an astounding figure. At least one detailed study suggests fixed-tilt PV systems require on average 2.85 acres per MW and that tracking systems take even more space—4.17 acres/MW. (Tracking systems use mechanisms to follow the sun, which increases energy yield but requires more spacing between rows to avoid shading as panels tilt and rotate.) Assuming 3.5 acres/MW are used on average for all the new solar PV being added in the next five years, nearly 13 million acres of land will be needed. To put that into perspective, that’s like covering the entire country of Slovakia or most of the state of West Virginia completely with solar panels.

“The solar industry’s resilience is real, but it’s not guaranteed,” Jorge Vargas, CEO of Aspen Power, told POWER. “The biggest potential disruptor would be supply chain friction, especially if trade policies shift in the coming years. Another leading indicator is the health of the tax equity market. If there’s any contraction in available tax credit capital, that would slow growth more than any technical factor.”

Residential Solar Has Gone Mainstream

Driving the decentralized energy movement, U.S. residential solar installations are now measured in the millions, with the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reporting well over 5 million total installations across the country. However, recent economic headwinds and policy transitions have led to a notable contraction in the rate of new residential installations through the first half of 2025. Still, SEIA’s base case forecast projects that the residential solar market will grow by 3% annually on average from 2025 to 2030.

SolarTech, a leading solar company with offices in California and Arizona, released its own study on the state of solar in December, which was created based on a survey of 2,000 homeowners. “What we’re seeing in the 2025 State of Solar report is a decisive shift in homeowner mindset,” Sonny Gonzalez, director of Marketing at SolarTech, told POWER. “Solar is no longer viewed as an experimental or early adopter investment—it’s becoming a standard part of long-term home planning. With roughly 70% of homeowners either already using solar or expecting to adopt it within the next five years, the market has clearly moved into the mainstream. This level of interest reflects not just improved technology and affordability, but a growing desire among homeowners to take control of their energy future.”

“Right now, the biggest driver is still the fundamental economics,” said Vargas. “Solar is cost-effective, scalable, and increasingly flexible across customer segments. Utility rates are expected to rise sharply over the next several years, which makes solar an even more compelling hedge against those escalating costs. The Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] provided a significant tailwind for project development, but as those incentives begin to phase out, developers and customers will have to rely more heavily on intrinsic project economics and risk management. Going forward, development will increasingly be driven by cost savings, energy resilience, and load-side management. The projects that get built will be those that help customers control costs and mitigate exposure to rising utility prices, even in a world without IRA-backed subsidies.”

“While utility savings remain the single strongest motivator for going solar, the data shows that homeowners are thinking far beyond monthly bills,” said Gonzalez. “Rising concerns about grid reliability, unpredictable outages, and increasing electricity rates are reshaping how people evaluate their energy options. Solar is now seen as a pathway to stability and independence. For many homeowners, adopting solar is as much about resilience and control as it is about reducing costs—and that marks a major evolution in the residential solar mindset.”

FEOC Rules Take Hold

The Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements are a set of restrictions established by Congress across several laws, beginning with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the IRA, and later expanded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, Figure 2). They are designed to prevent entities with strong ties to adversarial nations from benefiting from U.S. clean energy tax credits and to reduce U.S. reliance on these nations—specifically China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, which are defined in statute as “covered nations”—for critical components in the clean energy supply chain, such as solar panels and electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

FEOC and related “prohibited foreign entity” restrictions represent a significant shift in how clean energy projects qualify for federal tax incentives. Building on IRA and modified by OBBBA, these rules can deny technology‑neutral tax credits—including the Section 48E Investment Tax Credit, Section 45Y Production Tax Credit, and Section 45X Manufacturing Tax Credit—to power plants, energy storage projects, and U.S.‑made products that have too much ownership, control, or critical content traceable to entities linked to covered nations. Compliance analyses focus on several dimensions, including whether the taxpayer is a specified foreign or foreign‑influenced entity, the share of project or product costs attributable to covered‑nation equipment and materials, and whether contractual or financing arrangements give a prohibited foreign entity effective control or “material assistance” in the project.

“We may hear a lot more about FEOC in 2026,” Jim Nutter, managing director with Stout, told POWER. “Developers have tried their best to prepare, but the new part of the law and its interpretation might be hard to navigate in practice.”

Luther suggested uncertainty around the requirements remains. “For 2026, everyone is looking at FEOC to see where the rules end up,” he said.

The stakes are high. For certain technology‑neutral investment tax credits, projects can face full or substantial recapture if, within 10 years of being placed in service, the taxpayer makes payments that give specified prohibited foreign entities effective control or otherwise trigger the new ownership and “applicable payment” restrictions, depending on how the U.S. Department of Treasury ultimately interprets those rules. As the industry awaits clearer Treasury guidance, many developers are working to start construction before key effective dates to take advantage of grandfathering provisions, while also navigating tariff exposure and trying to secure FEOC‑compliant supply chains in a constrained and rapidly evolving market.

Supply Chain Issues Persist, but Some Improvement Seen

Supply chain disruptions have plagued the power industry since at least 2020 when the pandemic upset the normal flow of products, creating cascading delays in everything from transformers to turbines to solar modules. For years, developers have grappled with extended lead times, price volatility, and equipment shortages that stretched project timelines and squeezed margins.

Brandy Johnson, Chief Technology Officer with Babcock & Wilcox (B&W), suggested the problem was lingering long before the pandemic. “The power industry supply chain has retracted because power build-out in the U.S. has been so minimal for so long. But now, especially due to growing demand from AI and data centers, we have a projected build-out in the U.S. energy sector for more generation capacity in a shorter period of time than we’ve potentially seen in our lifetimes,” she told POWER.

“But the lack of manufacturing capacity means supply chains are really showing weakness in their ability to meet the industry’s needs,” Johnson said. “We’re seeing very long lead times on gas turbines, for example, because demand is greatly outpacing the rate at which they can be manufactured. The capacity to build pressure parts for boilers in the U.S. also is diminished, which means suppliers have to look overseas. It’s not just one thing. It’s all of the pieces of the supply chain that are affected.”

Still, it’s not all doom and gloom—the pressure is lessening in some areas. “We’re seeing some easing in the supply chain for basic construction materials, such as steel, which was a major bottleneck during the pandemic,” said Montgomery. “However, more complex materials are still facing delays, particularly those related to transmission line components and high-voltage equipment. High-voltage direct-current cables are an example of procurement that can take up to 24 months to source. The North American Electric Reliability Corp. states that the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, has reached around two years, with large power transformers [Figure 3] taking up to four years.”

“We will begin to see supply chain … challenges easing for sectors tied to electrification or distribution level, but continue to see long lead times for power transformers,” said Charles Murray, CEO and co-founder of Switched Source. “New investments in domestic transformer manufacturing at the distribution level are starting to have an impact, but do not expect prices to come back down for transformers or cables.”

“There have been major investments in domestic manufacturing of grid-critical equipment,” Tagare said. “In fact, National Grid is investing £35 billion over the next six years to help strengthen and unlock long-term supply chain capacity and skills across England and Wales.”

Luther suggested developers need to consider all of their options when sourcing components, not simply focus on one possibility while belaboring its lack of availability. “Everyone is talking about the backlog on utility-scale gas turbines, but there’s over 25 GW in annual global production of sub-100-MW generators that could be used,” he noted. “It’s a significant amount of smaller-scale generation that no one is talking about.”

Johnson also suggested developers should think about alternatives when an originally contemplated form of generation is unavailable. “Especially with data centers, B&W is trying to offer alternatives to build new power generation capacity when supply chain issues limit developers’ options,” she said. “For example, if a developer can’t get gas turbines for a combined cycle plant, we have alternatives that can help them get their plant online much sooner. Alternative technologies are coming to light because they may have supply chains that are more readily accessible.”

Another way companies can find a workaround for supply chain issues is through standardization. “One of the things B&W is doing to address this is more standardization in our boiler and plant designs,” Johnson said. “We’re telling customers that we can speed up the design and construction of a plant if we do less customization. With power producers wanting to bring projects online quickly, speed through standardization is critical.”

The T&D Dilemma

Even as supply chain constraints are overcome, or accounted for, a more fundamental bottleneck threatens to limit how quickly new generation can actually reach customers: the transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure itself. Interconnection queues have swelled to historic levels, with gigawatts of ready-to-build projects waiting years for grid connection studies and upgrades. While new solar farms and battery storage facilities can be constructed in months, the transmission lines needed to deliver their power often require a decade or more of planning, permitting, and construction. This growing mismatch between generation development timelines and grid infrastructure timelines has pushed T&D constraints to the forefront of industry challenges (Figure 4) for 2026 and beyond.

“Much of the focus on electricity growth is on new power generation, but power transmission and distribution constraints don’t seem to get as much attention in public discourse,” David Carter, industrials senior analyst at RSM US, told POWER. “Further, just like in generation, these transmission and distribution constraints need an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach. That includes not just new power lines, but expanding the capacity of existing ones by ‘reconductoring’ them with more modern cables and using technology solutions to make better use of what is already in place. In a time where permitting is such a challenge, having options to increase capacity without a years-long process to obtain new rights of way will be key.”

“Queue reform and transmission buildout are make-or-break for the [solar] industry’s ability to scale sustainably,” said Vargas.

Mark Feasel, vice president of Sales with Mission Critical Group, suggested limitations in power delivery could force developers to find other options. “Grid constraints will push organizations toward rapid adoption of distributed generation and on-site power strategies that bring energy closer to the load this year,” he said. “As data centers consume increasing portions of available capacity, hospitals, manufacturers, and other critical infrastructure operators will be forced to rethink how they secure not just reliable power, but resilient power, when the utility can no longer meet their needs.”

Luther suggested self-generation is already a growing trend. “A lot of hyperscalers are looking to bring their own generation and go behind the meter to avoid the long lead times of getting grid connected, which means the load might not materialize on the grid but off of it,” he said. “At the same time PJM, MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator], and SPP [Southwest Power Pool] are all accelerating queue timelines for dispatchable assets. So, if both of these trends emerge, its very likely these markets end up being better supplied than they are today.”

Meanwhile, leaders in Washington could also play a role this year. “The administration and Congress both seem to recognize the importance of permitting reform, and a streamlined process that reduces uncertainty would help power projects come online faster, with better project economics,” Carter noted.

Closing Thoughts

All of the leaders POWER spoke to expressed genuine optimism about the year ahead. Their confidence stems not from abstract hope but from tangible opportunities they see emerging in many areas. Yet, aside from the big talking points—AI, data centers, solar power’s future, supply chains, and infrastructure—three interesting items emerged.

“There is a growing importance of collaboration across the utility-startup ecosystem. Too many promising technologies stall in the ‘pilot doom loop’ because utility leaders and innovators lack the shared frameworks, data access, and operational pathways needed to move from experimentation to real system impact,” Tagare said. “The most successful solutions emerge when utility leaders and startups collaborate on deployment models early—aligning on integration requirements, regulatory considerations, and measurable value from day one.”

“With the increasing electrification of things such as transport, heating, and cooking, it’s important to recognize and plan for a shift in peak power from a summer afternoon to a winter evening as the heat gets going, dinner is cooking, and EVs are charging,” said Carter. “One leader for a distribution utility recently highlighted the importance of how ‘EVs come in gangs’ to neighborhoods as neighbors influence other neighbors on EV adoption, it can quickly overload local transformer capacity during peak periods without proper planning or load-shifting capabilities.”

“Most people understand that storage is important for solar, but the reality is that it still does not always make financial sense. Making storage work requires careful project design, timing, and alignment with grid needs. That is why we are so focused on it. Projects that get storage right will capture real value, while others risk underperforming,” Vargas said. “Another misconception is that solar growth will stall once IRA incentives fade. Projects with strong underlying economics will continue moving forward, and developers who integrate storage effectively will lead the market.”

The common thread running through these perspectives is clear: success in 2026’s power sector will belong to those who move beyond siloed thinking, whether that means utilities partnering earlier with innovators, grid planners anticipating neighborhood-level adoption patterns, or developers designing projects around actual grid value rather than subsidy availability. It’s a fascinating time to be involved in the power industry—the challenges are out there to be solved, and pioneering industry leaders are finding the answers.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-power-industry-forecast-1024x747.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:13:01.410022

Yet, despite these political moves, coal’s trajectory in the U.S. energy market has followed a different path, shaped more by economic realities than government intervention. Market forces, particularly the rise of cheaper and cleaner energy sources, continue to undermine coal development.

Coal once formed the backbone of American electricity production, with its usage steadily rising. However, since peaking in the early 2000s, coal-fired power has sharply declined. In 1950, coal was the dominant source of electricity across the grid, but by 2023, it accounted for only 9% of the nation’s total energy consumption.

A recent manifestation of the malaise is that the federal government rejected the recent “low-ball” bid from the sole bidder (Navajo Transitional Energy Co.) to acquire 167 million tons of coal on federal public lands in Montana. The company bid $186,000 (less than a penny per ton). The failed lease sale would have been the biggest federal government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed Montana coal lease sale vividly demonstrates the lack of interest for coal among utilities generating electricity throughout the country. They are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables. In spite of the administration’s interest in reviving the coal industry, economists say federal attempts to boost coal are not going to reverse its years-long decline.

Actions During President Trump’s First Term (2017–2021)

In its first term, the Trump administration tried to reverse the coal policies of the Obama administration through various actions, including:

Ending the Federal Coal Leasing Moratorium. A 2016 moratorium, which temporarily halted new coal leases on federal lands to allow for an environmental review, was lifted in March 2017. This Trump administration change reinstated the ability for companies to acquire new leases.

Rescinding New Valuation Rules. The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) repealed new rules that calculated royalties for coal extracted from federal land based on the sales price, rather than a lower figure. This move effectively reduced the cost for mining companies to extract coal.

Actions During Trump’s Second Term (2025–present)

President Trump’s second administration has continued and expanded the pro-coal policies of his first term. In April 2025, Trump signed a series of executive orders to boost the coal industry. These orders declare that “coal is essential to our national and economic security” and direct federal agencies to take several actions, such as:

Prioritize Coal Leasing. Agencies must identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to mining, and prioritize coal leasing.

Rescind Anti-Coal Policies. Agencies must overturn policies aimed at transitioning the country away from coal.

Promote “Clean” Coal Technology. Agencies must allocate $625 million toward recommissioning or modernizing aging coal plants.

Expand Federal Land for Mining. Agencies must open more than 20,000 square miles of federal land to mining.

Executive Orders

The recent executive orders and proclamations also include directions to various agencies to:

Promote coal for new technologies such as using coal to power new artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

Investigate and challenge state-level laws that restrict the use of coal and other fossil fuels.

Sharply reduce royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands.

Extend, by two years, the date by which coal-fired power plants were to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The same week that the U.S. Department of Energy allocated $625 million in funding for retrofitting and recommissioning aging coal plants to extend their lifespans, the DOI issued a press release stating that it would open 13.1 million acres of federal land to coal mining and streamline approvals for projects in Montana, Wyoming, and Tennessee.

Economics and the Markets Ultimately Drive Coal (or Any Energy) Development

Federal policies have not been able to reverse the decline in the demand for coal, even when those policies are favorable to the industry. Political attempts to support coal have not, for example, increased employment or production significantly. Some argue that regulations have been a factor, but market forces are the primary driver. Regulations can affect decisions, but market competitiveness remains the larger issue.

Ultimately, market fundamentals are the main drivers of coal development. While federal, state, and local policies can influence the market, they cannot override economic realities that demonstrate that the cost of coal development is rising, and other energy sources are more competitive. Simply put, the cost of coal is increasing, and coal plants have become more expensive to operate. Those realities contrast dramatically with the fact that newer energy alternatives will continue to drive down interest in the use of coal.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coal-free-image-from-rawpixel.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:13:05.905497

It's cold and snowy in much of the U.S. right now, but hard as it may be to believe in some parts of the country, heat season will eventually come again, and hotter summers are increasingly a risk for American workers. This year, the federal government is considering new rules to protect employees from excessive heat. A new study looks at what matters most for keeping workers safe. NPR's Alejandra Borunda reports.

ALEJANDRA BORUNDA, BYLINE: People have known forever that hot weather can be dangerous for workers. Even ancient Egyptians worried about dehydration for people building the pyramids. And the problem is just as critical for people working outside now. And it's not just heatstroke that's a risk.

ADAM DEAN: Heat makes people slower to react and worse at making decisions.

BORUNDA: Adam Dean is a political scientist who researches labor conditions at George Washington University.

DEAN: And that means that farm workers driving a tractor or a construction worker operating equipment is more likely to have a fatal accident on a hot day.

BORUNDA: Dean is the lead author of a new analysis in the journal Health Affairs. It looked at workplace deaths related to heat in California, which was the first state to pass protections for people who work outdoors. The researchers compared deaths in California with states nearby that didn't have those rules. The study found California's rules likely saved dozens of lives every year, even as climate change has made those heat risks more intense. But Dean says fine-tuning the rule took some trial and error.

DEAN: When California first adopted a heat standard in 2005, it was ineffective.

BORUNDA: Dean says the original guidelines weren't specific enough. They said employers, like farmers, for example, had to offer their workers water, shade and rest when it's hot. But when inspectors showed up, they sometimes found problems, like undrinkable water. So the state clarified. Water had to be drinkable and free, not just there, and there needed to be enough shade for all workers during breaks. The state also ramped up their inspections and launched an intensive campaign to educate workers about their rights. Dean says all those changes made a real difference.

DEAN: I think a critical lesson is that merely passing a heat standard is not enough. And it was only after the state launched a statewide enforcement campaign that we started to see deaths decrease relative to surrounding states.

BORUNDA: The new study was published as the federal government is currently considering new heat rules that would apply nationally. Worker advocates want it to mimic California's more specific rules, while many employer groups prefer a more flexible standard. The new study joins several other analyses published this year that found standards, especially strict ones, can protect workers. Barrak Alahmad is an occupational health researcher at Harvard University. He says all the studies use different datasets and methods.

BARRAK ALAHMAD: And in science, you like to see that. You like to see this consistency and these additional layers of evidence.

BORUNDA: The future of the federal heat rules is uncertain. They were first proposed under President Biden's administration, and the Trump administration is now reviewing them. In the meantime, several states and cities have adopted their own rules in recent years, and others, like New Mexico and Arizona, are currently considering them.

Environmental groups are yet again challenging Louisiana regulators in their decision to reissue a previously suspended permit for a liquified natural gas export facility in Cameron Parish.

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

The BREATHE report addresses the need for climate solutions as the nine-county Knoxville Metro area grows to an estimated one million residents by 2028.

Poor air quality is just one of many climate concerns, along with extreme weather conditions such as severe storms and flooding. The BREATHE plan is to cut climate-altering emissions by 75% (compared to 2022) by 2050. It includes involvement and support from the mayors of Knoxville, Maryville, and Alcoa.

Key areas of concern with room for improvement include energy use and building efficiency, transportation emissions, waste management, and the preservation of green spaces. Grassroots ideas are to make weatherization and energy upgrades more affordable for people. The ideas also point to more jobs in building technologies such as HVAC.

The report summarizes with:

“The BREATHE Plan is a roadmap for how to collectively act across the region to advance climate action in an equitable and sustained manner. Success depends on action from governments, businesses, nonprofits, and residents. Whether by weatherizing buildings, riding public transit, planting trees, or supporting local farms, every action counts. Together, we can build a Knoxville region that breathes easier, lives healthier, and thrives for generations to come.”

BREATHE is funded by an Environmental Protection Agency grant and was organized by the City of Knoxville’s Office of Sustainability and the Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization.

To see the community that Blue Ridge Conservancy has created around protecting our landscape is truly heartwarming.","The Blue Ridge Conservancy has sealed a deal to purchase Howard Knob after trying for 30 years to make sure the site overlooking Boone and coveted by rock climbers would never be developed.

Known to locals mostly as Howard’s Knob, the site is the summit of a mountain named for Benjamin Howard, a British loyalist said to have hidden in a cave near the knob during the Revolutionary War.

The knob is covered in boulders of gneiss, a hard stone that makes for technically challenging routes and doesn’t crumble as climbers traverse its face.

The conservancy says it’s raising money for trails and amenities and hopes to open the 74-acre property to the public sometime in 2026.

“Blue Ridge Conservancy is excited to reopen this historic climbing area and create additional hiking trails on the mountain, including the future location of the Northern Peaks State Trail,” Eric Hiegl, BRC’s senior director of land protection and conservation planning, said in an announcement about the purchase on the group’s website. “Land conservation projects have their own time schedule and happen when the time is right. Luckily for us the time to Save Howard Knob is now.”

The conservancy grew out of the first push to “Save The Knob” in 1993.

Area residents and students attending Appalachian State University knew the site from the late 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter’s Department of Energy selected it for the placement of an experimental wind turbine. It was celebrated at the time as the world’s largest windmill, with blades 97 feet long. The huge turbine was supposed to generate enough electricity to power hundreds of homes, but mostly it generated complaints from people who said it rattled the windows in their homes and interfered with their television reception.

The turbine was dismantled in 1983 and the 5-acre site where it sat became a Watauga County park.

In 1993, Floridian Monte Green bought an adjacent 74 acres of Howard Knob that contained a large boulder field and some of the best views from the mountain. Protesters gathered to try to protect the site, and the only home built there was Green’s, though he banned climbers from the property.

The boulders are so unusual and so attractive to climbers the site has been written about in Climbing magazine.

“The Howard Knob project was the catalyst that started the land conservation movement in the High Country,” conservationist and former High Country Conservancy Executive Director Michelle Merritt Leonard said in the announcement. “The energy around that project was hopeful and electric, attracting people to get on board! To see the community that Blue Ridge Conservancy has created around protecting our landscape is truly heartwarming. In the blink of an eye, it’s 30 years later, and we’re all coming together to see the project through. That’s something special.”

The Energy Department doesn’t get involved in those decisions ordinarily.
And it’s true of the Trump administration’s market interference in Indiana and Michigan.","The Trump administration is badly stretching the law to keep open coal-fired power plants throughout the Midwest that otherwise would have shuttered under well-thought-out, long-term strategies.

The latest examples are in neighboring Indiana, where the Department of Energy late last month ordered utilities not to close two aging power stations that otherwise would have been taken out of service by the end of last month. The orders mean that the Schahfer station in Wheatfield, Indiana, and the F.B. Culley station in Warrick County, Indiana, will remain open for 90 days.

If DOE’s previous actions in Michigan are a guide, where DOE saved a coal-fired plant about 35 miles east of Grand Rapids from closure beginning in May, those Indiana plants will likely get another 90-day reprieve after the current one expires and likely more such orders once the next 90 days pass by.

President Donald Trump long has supported the continued burning of coal to produce electricity despite risks to human health as well the emissions’ well-established contributions to Earth’s warming climate. At the same time, Trump recently acted to kill five large-scale wind farms already under construction in the Atlantic that are slated to generate enough power to serve 2.5 million household and business customers. Trump seems to detest wind power as much as he professes to love coal power.

In the case of the Michigan and Indiana coal plants, the Energy Department is ordering them kept alive under provisions of the Federal Power Act that are meant for reliability crises, such as those caused by natural disasters.

The Schahfer plant, located about 75 miles southeast of Chicago, was slated for closure years ago under a comprehensive plan put together by Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO), which serves much of the northern third of the state. While there are legitimate concerns throughout the Midwest about future reliability due to new data centers and their substantial power consumption, there is no looming emergency that justifies the administration’s action here.

Regional power-grid managers, in concert with utilities, have the ability to order plants on the chopping block to continue running if there are threats to reliability, and they use that authority from time to time. The Energy Department doesn’t get involved in those decisions ordinarily.

That’s how such decisions should continue to be made.

Heavy-handed government involvement in energy markets is not unique to Washington. We’ve seen governments at the state level, including in Illinois, get overly involved in determining the proper mix of power generation — usually to the detriment of ratepayers. Trump’s thumb on the scale to favor coal burners will have the same effect. After all, these plants were closing in part because they’re more expensive than other available energy sources. Ratepayers will shoulder that cost at a time when inflation and affordability are top public concerns.

Slowly but surely, the U.S. is moving in the direction of clean energy. With some exceptions, the market is doing a pretty good job of making that transition as cost effectively as possible. Government has a role to play — as a setter of environmental standards, for example — but shouldn’t be picking winners and losers.

That’s true in Illinois, where we’ve seen heavy-handed moves from those opposed to fossil fuels founder on realities of supply and demand. And it’s true of the Trump administration’s market interference in Indiana and Michigan.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-177045235-e1767209514599.jpg?w=1024&h=761,N,,2026-01-02 07:13:22.125819

NEW NORTH CAROLINA LAW STRICTLY DEFINING SEXES AS MALE OR FEMALE GOES INTO EFFECT

House Bill 805 was passed after a legislative override of the governor’s veto. The bill began life as a bipartisan effort to protect women and children from online sexual predators. After passing the state House, the bill was re-shaped in the Senate into what became an effort to codify gender identity into North Carolina law. The new law, which recognizes only two genders on all official state documentation, requires individuals to be identified by their gender at birth and not by their chosen gender identity or presentation. The change would most notably affect identification, such as driver’s licenses. While state senator Kevin Corbin (R) calls it “fair for everyone,” state senator Julie Mayfield (D) calls it “another example of importing to North Carolina this national anti-LGBTQ agenda.”

Senate Bill 248 takes a significant step in reducing the differences in birth certificates for those who are adopted. The new law allows for adoptive parents to be named on a child’s birth certificate, while making it easier for counties to issue certified birth certificates to adopted individuals.

Senate Bill 690 covers a range of business/broker-related issues. Most notably, its provision changes what is allowed on a real estate purchase offer. The change allows compensation paid (or commission to be paid) to a buyer’s agent to be included in the offer.

But earlier this month, Mayor Adams announced that the city will invest $68 million to build a bluebelt in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park—the borough’s first.

In Staten Island, the city started building them decades ago, when space was less of an issue. In the late 1990s, development on the island, especially on the South Shore, accelerated. Sewer systems did not extend across the entire island, and many homes still used septic tanks.

Staten Island needed sanitary sewers—a network of pipes connecting people’s homes to a sewage treatment plant—and storm sewers, which handle rainfall runoff. In about 60 percent of the city, stormwater and sewage run through the same pipes to wastewater treatment plants.

When the sewer system is overwhelmed during extreme rainfall events, both sewage and stormwater are discharged into the Hudson River and its estuaries through combined sewer overflows.

“We wanted to figure out how to work with water and not against it,” said Sangamithra Iyer, the chief of bluebelts and urban stormwater planning at the city Department of Environmental Protection.

Rob Brauman, deputy chief of bluebelt operations and maintenance at the city Department of Environmental Protection, and David Peterson, the deputy director of Staten Island construction at the city Department of Design and Construction, began working on bluebelts in the 1990s.

“Everything you see here was created,” said Brauman, as he looked at a portion of the New Creek bluebelt in Staten Island on an overcast morning. Ducks move leisurely along the stream in the middle of the constructed wetland, unbothered by the rain.

Before it became a bluebelt, the entire area was covered in phragmites—an invasive tall grass—and construction debris, Brauman said. Now, it’s full of native plants and wildlife. And when it rains, all that water flows to the wetland and eventually into the harbor, not into people’s homes.

For Staten Island, bluebelts offered a solution—not just for residents, but also for the local critters. Ducks can often be seen floating across these wetlands, and American eels have been observed in bluebelts in the southwest of the island.

In many Staten Island bluebelts, when it rains, water flows across streets and sidewalks and into storm grates, through storm sewer pipes and then conveys the water to a nearby wetland, or bluebelt.

The water discharges into a pool where sediment and other substances can sink to the bottom before it flows into the wetland. Another pool is located where the water re-enters the storm sewer system. Once the water enters the wetland, native plants help filter pollutants, including lawn fertilizer.

The water eventually re-enters the storm sewer network after passing through a trash grate, which captures much of the remaining debris. When the water is released into the Hudson River or the ocean, it’s cleaner.

The flow of water across the bluebelt also slows it down—most are designed to release water slowly over time, especially during a storm—preventing the sewers from overflowing and flooding the streets. They can also be adjusted depending on the severity of the storm.

In other cases, bluebelts can also enhance already existing ponds and streams to hold more water during storms.

According to Peterson, the cost of bluebelts—which can exceed $100 million—is worth it because it helps residents avoid costly insurance claims and flood damage repairs.

Initially, bluebelts were developed without climate change in mind, said Brauman. But now amid rising flood risks, they can accommodate the flow of water from more severe storms.

In 2012, a massive storm surge from Hurricane Sandy hit the East and South shores of Staten Island hard. According to the city, around 16 percent of the island’s residents were affected because they lived in the areas where the Federal Emergency Management Agency found that floodwaters had broken through.

The construction process can take years—future bluebelts often sit in areas with contaminated soil and construction debris. The soil must be removed and replaced to rebuild a healthy wetland, Peterson said.

According to materials provided by the Department of Environmental Protection, the city removed over 100,000 cubic yards of debris and tamed 12 acres of invasive weeds to build New Creek in Staten Island.

New Creek also had an active stream running through it, forcing Peterson and his team to divert the channel while they restored the soil beneath it.

In recent years, the city has sought to build bluebelts in flood-prone areas of Queens, but has encountered obstacles.

Many areas of Queens have combined sewer systems, making it difficult to separate stormwater from sewage. According to Rohit Aggarwala, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, this often means that the city must build new storm sewers to direct water to the bluebelt, which can be costly.

“We want to hold [water] and release it slowly so we prevent flooding downstream,” said Brauman, “and we want to give the plants time to clean the water.”

The city’s sewers were not designed for the amount of water that now falls on the city during intense storms. As Inside Climate News previously reported, some of the city’s plans, like sewer infrastructure projects, have been delayed.

According to Aggarwala, bluebelts and green infrastructure, which include natural solutions such as rain gardens, storm sewers and detention tanks that hold water during rainstorms, should be considered joint solutions to flooding across the city.

Sometimes, Aggarwala said, there is no entirely natural way to combat flooding in an area, and infrastructure is needed. For example, in a Brooklyn neighborhood affected by chronic flooding, his department plans to expand the sewer system’s capacity by upgrading the infrastructure because there is no space for bluebelts.

But sometimes, a multi-pronged approach is possible. In a neighborhood nicknamed the Hole which straddles the borders of Brooklyn and Queens, streets and homes sit multiple feet below the surrounding area, leading to chronic flooding. The city has recently announced a plan to help, which included the construction of storm sewers, raising some streets and building bluebelts.

“We’ve also been looking at a mix—bringing all sorts of green and gray infrastructure solutions to the single problem of flooding in a neighborhood,” said Aggarwala.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1178-1024x682.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 05:57:46.827868

Fifth, the Gulf of America is a leader in low-carbon intensity production, displacing dirtier foreign alternatives while lowering worldwide emissions.","Last year reminded America of a timeless truth our grandparents understood: When you empower the people who fuel your nation, prosperity follows.

In 2025, energy policy shifted from a defensive position to bold offense under new leadership. The results reverberated across America at the gas pump.

We are thankful for the contributions of the Gulf of America builders, fabricators, boat captains, engineers and offshore crews that helped to make these results possible, all in an energy basin that is one of our planet’s most productive and environmentally responsible producing provinces.

When policymakers treat domestic oil and gas as a strategic asset rather than a liability, communities thrive, jobs multiply and families breathe easier.

I drew six lessons from 2025:

First, reliability is a core value, not mere rhetoric. Americans judge policy by outcomes: lights that stay on and bills that don't break the bank. Efforts to bolster grid resilience and invest in critical infrastructure underscored that dependable, affordable domestic energy, rooted in oil and gas, is the bedrock of family stability and economic growth.

Second, an ""all-of-the-above"" strategy succeeds only when it honors the workers on the ground. Energy workers are America's competitive edge, not a footnote. When policies respect their grit and reduce regulatory burdens, private investment surges, creating high-wage jobs and revitalizing communities.

Third, domestic energy funds true conservation. This isn't a talking point, it's fiscal reality. The Great American Outdoors Act channels up to $1.9 billion annually from federal energy revenues to restore national parks, wildlife refuges and public lands, with much of it sourced from responsible oil and gas production in places like the Gulf of America.

Fourth, emissions reductions stem from innovation, not mandates. The United States has slashed greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 17% below 2005 levels, even as oil and gas output grew, thanks to American ingenuity in cleaner technologies and efficient practices.

Fifth, the Gulf of America is a leader in low-carbon intensity production, displacing dirtier foreign alternatives while lowering worldwide emissions.

Sixth, permitting reform is essential policy. Overregulation, redundant reviews and protracted timelines stifle wells, pipelines and grid expansions.

Moving forward, we need to continue playing offense.

Momentum demands focus and action. To secure 2025's gains, we must aggressively tackle challenges, especially in the Gulf of America. Predictable lease sales, stable timelines and globally competitive fiscal terms to attract investment maintain environmentally advantaged production and sustain the ports, shipyards and service firms that underpin Louisiana's middle class.

We must secure the entire energy chain, from molecules to electrons, by integrating pipelines, refineries, power plants and transmission as unified assets for resilience. Our workforce is a strategic priority: Vocational training, veteran transitions, maritime skills and apprenticeships are vital.

Progress is fragile. Every contractor bidding projects, shipyard hiring crews and offshore worker eyeing schedules knows clarity will quickly evaporate if we return to energy defense. We are reminded that there are no wealthy low energy consuming nations on the planet. In many ways, energy consumption has become a proxy for human prosperity.

Given that America has experienced six recessions from 1973 to 2019, all preceded by spikes in energy prices, it should not be debatable that American energy, including that from the Gulf of America, represents the best opportunity to achieve national energy dominance while curbing global emissions, supercharging the economy with family-sustaining wages and vibrant Main Streets and fortifying security by powering homes, hospitals and defenses without foreign reliance.

I don’t mean more trips to the gym and fewer to the refrigerator. Instead, I propose keeping our elected officials apprised that protection of natural habitats and native wildlife needs to be on the front burner.

Also, those we have placed in charge have a responsibility to ensure that our shared natural resources of air and water stay clean.

I have heard of proposals here and there at local, state and federal levels of government that would benefit a few at a cost to the many. If carried out, from county to national levels, the effect on the natural environment would be regrettable and would, in turn, adversely affect us all.

As a prime example at the federal level, substantive changes that might be forthcoming in the Environmental Protection Agency are uncertain. But any rumblings that we need to weaken the oversight and rulings by this critical government program should be cause for alarm.

And the idea proposed by some of abolishing the EPA entirely is beyond alarming; it is absurd and would be inherently irresponsible for any member of Congress to support. A worthwhile New Year’s resolution would be to oppose any legislation that even hints at getting rid of a government agency that limits assaults on the environment from unchecked commercial greed.

The outcomes from a weakened EPA would be detrimental to the majority of U.S. citizens.

As I have noted before, specters of what would happen by gutting the authority of the EPA are disquieting. Do we really want to curb EPA regulations that prevent mining wastes from being dumped into clear-flowing mountain streams? Do we want streams that trout and other aquatic wildlife can no longer live in?

I don’t think so. President Richard Nixon had it right when he formed the EPA in 1970 and signed the Clean Water Act in 1972.

Another suggestion has been to reduce EPA air quality regulations. Such regulations limit emissions that result in undesirable outcomes such as acid rain, smog and lung cancer.

Think about it. In the 1960s in Gary, Indiana, and Birmingham, Alabama, you could not see buildings half a mile away because of the smoke and soot filling the air. President Nixon did the right thing when he signed the Clean Air Act in 1970.

Weakening regulatory features of the EPA would definitely not be an improvement. Clean air and clean water are crucial for maintaining the quality of life we have come to expect.

I suggest everyone resolve to keep our country’s natural heritage and a healthy environment as priorities for the coming year. Keep an eye on proposed changes in any program that can affect the environment in your community, your region, your nation.

Resolve to challenge your congressional representatives when you hear of a proposal that would diminish the effectiveness of maintaining standards for potable water and unpolluted air.

Make a resolution to get the facts when politicians start making promises they claim will help everybody. Do not fall for the political ploy that the economy will be boosted and jobs created if environmental regulations are weakened or eliminated.

Look, instead, at who would benefit from the loosening of any given environmental regulation. Someone will be making money. But you can be sure it won’t be you and me. We will be stuck with murky skies, undrinkable water and habitats in which our native wildlife cannot survive.

I have used the EPA as an example, but bad things could be happening environmentally in your community, your county or your state. Resolve to pay attention to what would happen to your air, water and ecosystems if certain regulations are eliminated.

Will a proposed change be in the best public interest or does it financially benefit only a few special interest groups? Make environmental resolutions for yourself and future generations — and have a happy new year.

The memorable quote from Charles Hua of consumer advocacy group PowerLines sums up the current conversation on energy affordability, which defined federal, state, and local policy and politics this year.

Americans are in the midst of a broader cost of living crisis, spurred by the first real bout of inflation in decades. Electricity bills have become a major driver of that worrisome trend, with costs rising at more than twice the rate of inflation over the last year, largely because it’s expensive to maintain, expand, and repair the grid.

Now, President Donald Trump’s policies are making the bad situation worse — despite his frequent promises to bring down costs. On his first day in office, Trump declared an ​“energy emergency,” saying Americans faced an ​“active threat” from high energy prices and that the country needed an ​“affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy” to curb them.

“Reliable” is code for coal and gas in the Trump administration’s book. The U.S. Department of Energy has used the ​“emergency” to keep fossil-fueled power plants open past their retirement dates and to prop up the dying coal industry, at great expense to ratepayers. A Michigan coal plant that was supposed to shutter in May instead racked up $650,000 each day in costs for ratepayers after the DOE ordered it to keep running. That number will only grow as the plant runs through the winter.

Meanwhile, the administration has retaliated against cheaper and quicker ways to get more power online: namely, renewables and battery storage. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed in July, scraps tax credits for solar and wind deployment as well as incentives for home energy improvements. The result? Fewer cheap clean energy projects will be built, and by 2035 the average American household will pay $170 more each year for energy than they do now, according to the think tank Energy Innovation.

It’s not just electricity. Natural gas prices are expected to rise this winter as well, and a delay in the distribution of federal home heating assistance, spurred by the government shutdown, will only exacerbate the challenge for families. More cuts to federal programs that help households reduce their energy usage and bills, including Energy Star and the Weatherization Assistance Program, could still be on the way.

The urgency of the energy affordability situation is starting to shape politics at the state and local level, too.

Throughout the year, blue-state lawmakers have invoked affordability both to bash the Trump administration for stymieing renewables — and to excuse their own backtracking from climate goals. That dichotomy has been especially apparent in New York, which in July passed a groundbreaking ban on new gas hookups that was expected to lower families’ energy usage and bills, but then paused its implementation just a few months later. In November, New York also authorized a gas pipeline project it had rejected three times before. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has cited affordability concerns for her decisions.

Affordability also factored in on Election Day.

New Jersey’s Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on the promise of building out more clean energy, including offshore wind, to curb rising prices. In Virginia, Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and Democratic state legislators ran their successful campaigns on the promise of curbing power prices in the data center capital of the world. And in Georgia, where rates are rising fast, two Democrats who promised a focus on affordability and ​“clean, reliable energy” unseated Republican incumbents on the regulatory commission that oversees ratemaking for the state’s utilities.

The problem is likely to dominate the conversation again next year, exacerbated by concerns about data centers gobbling up power and Trump administration policies making it hard to build new electricity generation. Consumer advocates have called for officials to take bold action — including reducing utility profit rates and finally making it possible to build transmission lines — to alleviate the rising prices. We’ll see if any of those solutions actually come to fruition in 2026.

The developer said it would be in a ""better position"" to give a construction timeline once it knew the outcome of its non-material change application, a process used to make small alterations to an already approved project.

The Sunnica Energy Farm was approved in July 2024 by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who described solar power as ""crucial to achieving net-zero"".

But there has so far been no visible work on the three main sites, which are:

Sunnica East Site A, near West Row and Mildenhall in Suffolk

Sunnica East Site B, south of the village of Worlington, near Mildenhall

Sunnica West Site A, near Newmarket, north of the A14 in Cambridgeshire

The developers behind the project said they needed to make a non-material change application to ensure it could connect into Burwell substation.

Sunnica said the farm could power up to 172,000 homes and create 1,500 jobs during construction, with 27 full-time jobs to operate it.

Ms Judkins said: ""There are far better ways to deliver solar, together with communities and without the extensive harm that the Sunnica scheme will do.""

Suffolk County Council has also been ""opposed"" to the development.

Cabinet member Richard Rout said: ""It is for the developer to explain the delay to the delivery of their project.

""There is an open consultation regarding proposed amendments to the scheme, which closes on 16 January, to which the county council will be responding and we would encourage others to do the same.""

The BBC asked the Department for Energy Security and Net-Zero about the lack of progress.

A spokesperson said: ""Large-scale projects, such as Sunnica solar farm, often need to complete a range of post-consent work before starting construction.

""We have approved enough clean energy projects to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes, helping get us off fossil fuels and deliver energy security so we can bring bills down for good.""

No indictment for Akron police officer who killed 15-year-old Jazmir Tucker

Akron police officer Davon Fields will not face criminal charges for the November 2024 killing of 15-year-old Jazmir Tucker, a Summit County grand jury determined on Oct. 2.

According to court records obtained by Signal Akron, Mahoning County prosecutors only asked grand jurors to consider a murder charge against Fields and, if they indicted him for murder, whether an additional firearms charge would apply.

The grand jury declined to indict Fields on either charge.

Voters elect three new members for Akron Board of Education

At Missing Falls Brewery the night of Nov. 4, the mood was buoyant as several candidates for the Akron Board of Education and their supporters watched the votes roll in.

Phil Montgomery, who hosted the gathering, led the pack of eight candidates from the time early vote totals began to come in. With all precincts reporting, Montgomery, the Summit County finance and budget director, won one of four seats to remake the embattled school board.

“This, my friends, is a mandate,” Montgomery said later from Rockne’s, where his watch party moved after Missing Falls closed. “This isn’t a fluke, this isn’t a one off. We are here to take our district back and do what’s right for our kids and our educators.”

Akron’s new Lock 3 park is a magnet that’s drawing people downtown

The $17 million renovation project sought to make Lock 3 an everyday destination instead of a place people only visit to see a concert. Winding pathways that follow the slope of the ground, a patio area with chairs and tables and landscaping that makes the canal itself more visible — patrons and planners alike say it’s had the desired effect.

The goal of the renovation was to turn the often-blocked-off park into Akron’s living room, said Kyle Kutuchief, the Akron program director for the Knight Foundation. He called it a home run project, saying he knew it had succeeded when he saw college students sunbathing in the park earlier this year as winter turned to spring.

What did the investigative report into Akron school superintendent’s behavior show?

After months of investigation into the embattled Akron Public Schools’ superintendent, a law firm hired by the school board concluded Michael Robinson had behaved in an “unprofessional, toxic, demeaning, and hostile manner” since he was appointed to the helm of the school district in July of 2023.

The 24-page report issued by the Brennan Manna Diamond (BMD) law firm and provided to school board members April 14 detailed serious allegations of retaliation against whistleblowers, hostility and threats toward perceived and real critics, insults made against students, public records law violations, and other damning allegations.

Man reported to have gun was unarmed when Akron police shot him outside Ellet bar

One week after an Akron police officer shot a man who had been kicked out of an Ellet bar, 911 audio documents that dispatchers were told the man had been threatening people with a gun.

But body-worn camera footage from Nov. 11 shows that the man was unarmed when a police officer shot him, 22 seconds after arriving on the scene. The footage was released within a week, as required by city law.

The footage documents that Officer Caleb Bodjanac fired 15 shots in three seconds at 36-year-old Corey Phillips, striking him at least twice in the chest, after a seemingly confused Phillips reached in the general direction of his jacket and pants pockets.

City’s lead water lines a thing of the past in Akron

The City of Akron has officially reached a milestone it has been working toward since the 1960s: the complete removal of city-owned lead water lines, which typically provide service from the street to the sidewalk edge closest to the house or structure.

“We’re very proud that, in about two weeks, we’re going to announce that we are going to be lead-free,” said Chris Ludle, Akron’s director of public service, during the Oct. 29 Ward 2 meeting.

After Akron removed the last few city-owned lead service lines, it became one of only a handful of American cities to be lead-free. It will now focus on replacing galvanized house lines that were previously connected to lead. This work is expected to be completed by 2027.

Grand jury clears Akron police officer in 2024 fatal shooting of Michael Jones

The Akron police officer who killed a 54-year-old Akron man at an East Avenue gas station in 2024 will not face criminal charges after a Summit County grand jury voted against issuing an indictment.

The Ohio attorney general’s law enforcement arm, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, investigated the killing of Michael Jones for eight months. The attorney general’s special prosecutors waited four months to present the case to a Summit County grand jury on Aug. 13, and that body declared within hours there wasn’t enough evidence to indict the officer.

Akron wins 2025 All-America City award for fourth time

The City of Akron was selected as a National Civic League All-America City for a fourth time in June in Denver.

As he accepted the award, Akron Mayor Shammas Malik said, “This Saturday, Akron is going to celebrate 200 years, and you have given us an incredible birthday present.”

Malik credited the city’s Lauren Marsh, assistant to the chief of staff, and Emma Lieberth Osborn, policy and grants strategist, who he said thought it was important to apply for the recognition.

“Akron is an All-America City because of the people who call it home,” Malik said.

Firm selected by Akron mayor to review police use of force is familiar face

After nearly a year of false starts, Akron Mayor Shammas Malik’s administration selected the firm that will review the Akron Police Department’s use-of-force policies, an issue he’s called a “matter of life or death” and “the most significant issue facing our city.”

The mayor’s original plan to hire New York law firm Paul, Weiss was shot down in February by Akron City Council. Council members balked at the potential $768,000 price tag and the secretive selection process before approving legislation requiring the city to have a more transparent bidding process, a significantly smaller price tag, and some sort of involvement with the University of Akron’s criminal justice program.

In late September, the city picked Police Executive Research Forum, a policing policy and research organization based in Washington, D.C., that it has previously done business with. For the use-of-force review, the firm was awarded a $328,873 contract — some of that money will fund work by employees at the University of Akron Department of Criminal Justice Studies — with the goal of doing the bulk of its work within the first three months of 2026.

Akron RubberDucks sold to Prospector Baseball Group

The Akron RubberDucks, the AA minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, have been sold. The new owners are Prospector Baseball Group. Co-founders John Abbamondi and Ben Boyer also purchased the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, an affiliate of the Miami Marlins and the other minor league baseball team owned by previous RubberDucks owner Ken Babby and his Fast Forward Sports Group.

Ending nonprofit era in Akron: For-profit firm buys Summa Health for $515M, promises transformation

The nonprofit hospital system Summa Health has officially been acquired by a venture-capital-funded, for-profit company.

The $515 million sale to General Catalyst’s Health Assurance Transformation Company, known as HATCo, will mean more artificial intelligence and other technology will be used at Summa, as General Catalyst plans to use the hospital as a “test kitchen” for the more than 100 healthcare companies it’s invested in.

It means the end of Summa’s $850 million in debt, the end of a foundation that supported Summa and the beginning of the Trailhead Community Health Foundation. That foundation will be funded with an additional $15 million on top of the purchase price and with leftover proceeds from the sale after Summa’s debt has been retired — a total figure that is not yet known.

Akron’s Firestone Plant #1, and its clock tower, will be demolished, city confirms

The City of Akron has confirmed it intends to demolish Firestone Plant #1 in its entirety after rejecting a proposal to turn it into the new police headquarters.

The police headquarters proposal was the only one the city received in a last-ditch effort to find someone willing to redevelop the 115-year-old building. That idea came in after the deadline city officials set for proposals to be received, Stephanie Marsh, a spokesperson for Akron, said in an email.

The rejection means demolition of the building will continue to the front bay around March, with the entire building razed in April, although Akron City Council passed a new resolution mid-December asking the mayor to save at least the clock face.

Akron’s Quaker Square redevelopment: gelato, cigars, pickleball?

On a sunny Tuesday afternoon, the new owners of Quaker Square stood on the roof of the onetime grain silos, surveying Akron below.

From the top, unfinished floor of the silos-turned-hotel, they had climbed up a worn stepladder, through a rooftop hatch, to the building’s summit. With the owners were representatives from WRT, the Philadelphia planning and design firm hired to help design the master plan for the sprawling complex.

On the roof, John Keene, a principal and architect with the firm, held up his phone to capture Akron’s skyline. Inside, Jared McKnight, a senior associate with the firm, said he thought the building was incredible.

“There’s so much history layered in here,” McKnight said, standing on the unfinished floor. “I think anything is possible.”

Visitors enjoy first look inside Akron History Center

Nuggets of local history are among those now on display at the Akron History Center. On April 5, the long-awaited attraction in downtown Akron opened to visitors following the cutting of a “Ribbon of Rubber.”

Hundreds showed up for the grand opening. Nestled next to the Akron Civic Theatre and adjacent to Lock 3, the free museum doesn’t have an inch of space that isn’t thoughtfully covered by displays and homages to the Rubber City’s storied past.

The three-floor building on South Main Street houses more than 60 exhibits and 150 artifacts, accompanied by 30 flat screens with video presentations of historical figures and moments.

Police, fire, non-union and ‘white collar’ unionized City of Akron employees receive pay raises

The members of Akron’s police union and non-union City of Akron employees received retroactive and future pay raises, along with more than 500 additional city employees. Pay raises for the employees in unions representing Akron firefighters and many of the city’s “white collar” workers also received substantial raises.

The significant raises in the three collective bargaining agreements finalized this fall, and the legislation for slightly smaller raises for non-unionized city employees, were enacted months after City of Akron Director of Finance Steve Fricker told City Council that the police union contract raises alone would mean the city “would be facing fiscal caution by 2027 with less than 30 days cash on hand and, by 2029, would need to cut between 100-180 city jobs.”

Akron is adding more than 2,000 trees to its urban canopy

More than 2,000 new trees are taking root across Akron this year, marking one of the city’s most significant canopy gains in recent years. The growth comes through two complementary efforts: a large-scale street tree initiative led by the City of Akron and a federally funded neighborhood-based project known as Project ACORN.

Together, these investments are helping bring shade to low-canopy neighborhoods, improve air quality and begin addressing long-standing disparities in tree coverage across the city.

The biggest impact comes from Akron’s 2025 street tree planting plan, announced by Mayor Shammas Malik in February. The administration committed to planting 1,800 new trees in devil strips, focusing on South and Southwest Akron, where canopy levels have historically been lowest.

Akron sewer project nears completion, may save $230 million

Akron may be one step closer to saving nearly $230 million while still fulfilling the requirements of its water treatment consent decree.

The city presented a plan to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to update its Cuyahoga Street Storage Facility for about $30 million rather than build a new $265 million “enhanced high-rate treatment” facility (EHRT), the last step in the massive, $1 billion Akron sewer project.

Akron has made substantial progress in meeting the consent decree requirements, completing 24 of 26 mandated projects, with the Northside Interceptor Tunnel slated to be in use by the end of 2026. The $265 million treatment plant is the final project, which Akron has been trying to remove the city from the decree for years.

Cameras up! Three Goodyear blimps fly over Akron to celebrate 100th anniversary

In honor of the 100th anniversary of the first Goodyear blimp flight, three airships flew over the city June 3 during Akron Mayor Shammas Malik’s State of the City address at Lock 3 park as well the Akron RubberDucks game later.

Attendees at the mayor’s speech witnessed the three blimps circle downtown for hours, with the classic black and gray Wingfoot One, based in Akron, in the lead throughout. It was joined by its blimp brethren, the Florida-based Wingfoot Two and the California-based Wingfoot Three.

It will take effect in May of 2026, one year after Governor Henry McMaster signed it.","COLUMBIA, S.C. — The new year is bringing several changes to South Carolina law, with major legislation taking effect Jan. 1 and more set to roll out later in 2026.

One of the most significant changes impacts bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, following years of concern from business owners about rising insurance costs.

A new law changing liquor liability and insurance requirements takes effect Thursday. Under a 2017 statute, bars and restaurants serving alcohol after 5 p.m. were required to carry a $1 million liability insurance policy to cover damages in civil lawsuits. Many owners said the cost of that coverage became unaffordable, forcing some businesses to close.

The new law allows businesses to carry lower insurance limits if they adopt certain risk-reduction measures, like stopping alcohol service at midnight or requiring alcohol server training for employees. They can get their requirement reduced as low as $300,000.

Even with the changes, it remains unclear whether the new requirements will lead to fewer lawsuits or lower premiums.

“Many people will actually believe the savings are simply based on the fact that you can purchase less insurance. But that actually should come secondary, secondary to what we would all hope would be fewer accidents, injuries and deaths involving intoxicated drivers,” said Robert Hartwig, a professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business.

As businesses decide whether to adopt the new risk-reduction measures, Hartwig said it could take time to see any real changes in insurance costs, including whether more companies are willing to offer coverage.

Another law taking effect Jan. 1 expands privacy protections for active and former law enforcement officers and judges. The change limits public access to their personal contact information in government records, particularly on publicly searchable government websites.

Some laws passed during the last legislative session will take effect later in the year. Part of a teacher reform package known as the Educator Assistance Act is scheduled to begin in July 2026, after the majority of the bill took effect in July 2025.

Under that law, school districts will be required to notify teachers in advance of the next school year whether they will have a job the following year. Districts must also provide teachers with their assignments at least 14 days before the start of the school year and limit certain reassignments without prior notice and a demonstrated need.

While Revolution Wind continues to seek to work constructively with the Administration and other stakeholders towards an expeditious and durable resolution of this matter, it believes that the lease suspension order violates applicable law. As was the case with the August 2025 stop-work order, the Revolution Wind Project (“Project”) faces substantial harm from a continuation of the lease suspension order. As a result, litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the Project.

Revolution Wind secured all required federal and state permits in 2023, following extensive reviews that began more than nine years ago. As a requirement of the permitting process, the Project engaged in years-long consultation with the U.S Department of Defense [War] Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse to address potential impacts to national security and defense capabilities from construction through to operation of the Project. Those consultations resulted in a fully executed formal agreement between the Department of War, the Department of the Air Force, and Revolution Wind outlining mitigation measures by the Project.

Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon, and has met the requests of, a thorough review process. Additional federal reviews and approvals included the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, and many other agencies.

Revolution Wind is in advanced stages of construction and is expected to be ready to deliver reliable, affordable power to American homes in 2026. The Project, now approximately 87 percent complete, has already installed all offshore foundations and 58 of 65 wind turbines. Export cable installation is complete, and both offshore substations have been installed. At the time of the lease suspension order, the Project was expected to begin generating power as soon as January 2026.

The Project will strengthen electric grid reliability as a critical part of the Northeast energy supply, which is crucial to meeting growing energy demand. The Project is set to provide affordable power to more than 350,000 homes in 2026 under 20-year power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island. This includes supporting the growing power needs of data centers and AI, with experts including ISO-NE, the independent grid operator, warning that halting the Project may increase electricity costs and lower reliability for the region.

Revolution Wind has supported thousands of American jobs across construction, operations, shipbuilding, and manufacturing, including more than 1,000 union jobs that have already contributed 2 million union work hours to this Project. The Project is a part of Ørsted’s investment into American energy generation, grid upgrades, and port infrastructure, as well as a supply chain, including U.S. shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states.

Sunrise Wind LLC, a separate project and wholly owned subsidiary of Ørsted that also received a lease suspension order on December 22 continues to evaluate all options to resolve the matter, including engagement with relevant agencies and stakeholders and considering legal proceedings.

The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft.","In July, Bloom Energy entered an agreement with Oracle to deploy its fuel cell technology to power selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) data centers in the U.S. Then, in October, it entered into a strategic partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to deploy its fuel cells across Brookfield's global AI data center portfolio in a deal valued at up to $5 billion.

Oklo's technology is still a few years away from commercial deployment

Oklo develops advanced fission power plants known as Aurora powerhouses, but does not currently have a commercially operating business. Instead, it is investing heavily in research and development, obtaining Nuclear Regulatory Commission certifications, and securing customers for its next-generation nuclear plant technology.

Its Aurora powerhouses use metal-fueled fast-reactor technology based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, which operated for 30 years at the Argonne National Laboratory until it was shut down in 1994. These reactors can run on recycled fuel, with the Aurora powerhouse designed to operate for over 10 years before refueling.

Oklo's Aurora powerhouses could address the biggest hurdle to AI expansion: the power grid connection gap. There is a growing mismatch between the speed at which data centers require power and the pace at which utilities can approve and build new grid connections to supply it.

Like Bloom's servers, its powerhouses could help meet energy needs quickly. However, the company doesn't expect its first commercial powerhouse to come online until 2027 or 2028.

The better stock to buy today

Oklo has its work cut out for it and won't be earning meaningful revenue until 2028 at the earliest. Its powerhouses are promising advanced nuclear technology that could help address future energy demand. Still, they won't be operational for a few years, leaving investors vulnerable to significant price swings at this early stage of the business.

Bloom Energy, on the other hand, has a product ready today that is quick to deploy and can generate meaningful revenue. The stock is expensive, trading at 87.5 times next year's earnings and 34.5 times projected 2027 earnings. But analysts covering the stock project revenue of $1.9 billion this year, with another 30% increase next year to nearly $2.5 billion. Given its near-term earnings upside, Bloom Energy is a better stock to own as we head into the new year.

In one of our prognostications two years ago, we asserted that U.S. natural gas storage was finally emerging from the economic wilderness.

Absolutely not! So in today’s Prognostications, we’ll try to avoid getting unhorsed as we delve into some of the most important and interesting developments we see ahead in 2026.

We’ll start at #10 and work our way up to #1.

10. Permian Gas Prices Stay Depressed Until the Late-2026 Pipeline Egress Overbuild.

With Permian natural gas production continuing to grow and pipeline egress constrained, gas prices at the Waha hub have been depressed for most of the past two years, with Waha below zero 42% of the time in 2024 and 24% of the time last year. Waha averaged $2.80/MMBtu below Henry Hub last year and hit $12/MMBtu under in late October. The good news? Relief is in sight. But it won’t be coming until the second half of 2026 when three pipeline projects are scheduled to come online: Kinder’s Gulf Coast Express expansion, Whitewater’s Blackcomb and the first part of Energy Transfer’s Hugh Brinson. Those projects total 4.5 Bcf/d of new capacity — more than enough to relieve the basin’s capacity constraints. At that time, the Permian discount (basis) to Henry Hub will shrink to less than $1/MMBtu and stay there for the next eight years. That’s because there is another 6 Bcf/d of new egress projects scheduled for 2027-29: Phase 2 of Hugh Brinson, Whitewater’s Eiger Express and Energy Transfer’s TransWestern expansion. That’s great news for producers. Maybe not so great for marketers holding capacity on egress pipelines.

9. More Canadian Oil Exports Headed to the U.S.

For the past five years, Canadian crude production has grown at a healthy 4% compound average growth rate (CAGR), and we project a continuation of that growth, albeit at about half the historical rate. Most of those incremental barrels will be coming to the U.S. Until the spring of 2024, all of Canada’s crude not consumed in the country (~15%) moved to the U.S. (mostly to refineries; some to re-export markets), but startup of the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) project pulled more barrels to British Columbia for export. Even though some of those exports ended up on the U.S. West Coast, total flows to the U.S. were down by about 100 Mb/d in 2025. In 2026, Canadian production growth will reverse that decline, and more Canadian barrels will flow to the U.S. on projects from Enbridge (a 30-Mb/d Express expansion into Montana in 2026 and a 150-Mb/d Mainline expansion in 2027) and various under-the-radar projects by other pipeline companies.

8. Good Times Roll for Natural Gas Storage.

In one of our prognostications two years ago, we asserted that U.S. natural gas storage was finally emerging from the economic wilderness. For much of the prior decade, storage values had been deeply depressed, the result of an overbuild following the late-2000s Shale Boom. By 2023, however, storage economics began to recover, driven by rapid LNG export growth, the need for gas to backstop intermittent wind and solar generation, and several disruptive weather events. At the time, we cautioned that this recovery would be uneven: mostly “brownfield” projects along the Gulf Coast, and mostly salt caverns, reflecting the rising value of high-deliverability injection and withdrawal capability rather than sheer working-gas volume. And that’s pretty much how it has played out — so far. But now, looking into 2026 and beyond, it appears a new wave of gas storage is coming. Rising demand for natural gas in power generation — driven by broader electrification, the rapid buildout of AI-driven data centers, and efforts to better coordinate gas and power markets — is boosting the need for additional storage. Unlike the recent cycle, this next phase is likely to include more greenfield developments, not only along the Gulf Coast but also in other regions of the U.S. and Canada.

7. Gas-Electric Coordination Will Finally Get Traction.

This one has seen only incremental improvements over the past 20 years but now looks poised to see some real progress. At least we hope so. The problem? Suffice to say that daily-scheduled gas pipelines and real-time-scheduled power generators don’t play well together. The problem keeps getting worse. Electric and gas folks have tried to harmonize their processes, but there have been few significant improvements. Until now. New demand for power — especially from data centers for AI — have both the electricity and gas markets fired up, so to speak. Natural gas now dominates U.S. power generation, supplying more than 40% of electricity, and the power sector has become the largest single consumer of gas. Yet pipelines originally built for steady local distribution company (LDC) loads are increasingly serving generators that ramp hard and fast whenever needed, often relying on interruptible natural gas service (versus more expensive firm service). At the same time, pipeline and storage capacity growth in the most vulnerable parts of the U.S. have lagged gas demand growth, reducing system flexibility. Add growing winter peaks, renewable intermittency and looming data-center load and the message is clear: Relying on interruptible gas is an unsustainable reliability risk. Those realities are driving a renewed push for real gas-electric coordination, led by Energy Secretary Chris Wright and a new National Petroleum Council (NPC) report (see Happy Together). We believe those initiatives will result in tangible progress, both on the regulatory and commercial fronts, starting in 2026.

6. A Lot More NGL Production Growth Is Coming.

Over the past 10 years, U.S. NGL production has grown at an 8.5% CAGR. That’s more than double the ~4% rate for crude oil and natural gas. Even though U.S. NGLs were up to 7.5 MMb/d in 2025, the growth rate was still near that elevated level, with production up about 500 Mb/d for the year, or about 30% more than U.S. crude oil. We’ve touted the NGL complex many times in the RBN blogosphere, attributing the high growth rate to gassier wells in the big NGL basins (more gas per barrel of oil), more NGLs per Mcf (thousand cubic feet) of gas produced, and a lot more new, high-efficiency gas processing plants. Of course, in 2025 about three-quarters of that volume growth came from the Permian, the undisputed king of NGL production. And that’s with gas production constrained by pipeline egress capacity. What would happen if pipeline egress were not constrained? Well, as we discussed in Prognostication #10, that’s exactly what is going to happen in H2 2026 and 2027. So, with more gas pipelines out of the basin and strong natural gas prices thanks to rising LNG exports and power-gen demand, it should look really good for NGLs over the next two years. Like another 500 Mb/d in 2026 while Permian gas remains constrained for half the year and blasting up to an 800-Mb/d gain in 2027 when gas is flowing freely — considerably more incremental barrels than crude oil.

5. Dry-Gas Islands Will Increasingly Impact Supply.

Lately there’s been a lot of market buzz around a handful of niche gas plays that share a common profile: the gas is dry, wells are deeper than legacy development in the area, reservoirs are often overpressured, initial production (IP) rates are high, and economics look compelling — especially with gas prices north of $4/MMBtu. One example is the Western Haynesville (primarily East Texas’s Leon and Freestone counties), where some wells can post eye-popping IPs approaching 40 MMcf/d, albeit from very deep, hot, long-lateral wells that are expensive to drill. A comparable story has been unfolding in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas’s Webb County, which over the past few years has emerged as a bona fide dry-gas play. Development there, most notably EOG Resources’ Dorado play, has gained enough momentum to justify dedicated takeaway, in particular an EOG-backed pipe to move gas to the Agua Dulce hub. Another example is the San Juan Basin (northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado), where operators are ignoring legacy coalbed methane and targeting the deeper, horizontally drilled Mancos Shale. Our prognostication? These smaller “dry-gas islands,” alongside the core Louisiana/Texas dry-gas Haynesville, are likely to command much more attention in 2026, driven by stronger gas-price signals tied to LNG exports and power demand, and by a crude-price environment that’s looking a bit less supportive of oil-focused drilling.

4. The Crude Oil Drill Rig Efficiency Trend Will Continue.

Since 2022, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. has been on a steady decline, falling by roughly 8% per year. Over that same period, oil production has moved the other way, rising from about 12 MMb/d to 13.5 MMb/d, or roughly 4% annually. Said another way, in 2022, an average of 575 crude rigs were running (per Baker Hughes) when production was 12 MMb/d. By 2025, the average rig count had fallen to about 445, even as production climbed to an annual average of 13.5 MMb/d. Today, the oil-directed rig count is down to just over 400 and production is at 13.8 MMb/d. This isn’t a new story. More efficient rigs, longer laterals, faster cycle times, enhanced pad drilling, and improved completion designs have all driven sharply higher output per rig. Add in improved geosteering and tighter spacing optimization, and each rig now delivers far more barrels than it once did. Many pundits have expected this efficiency trend to fade as prime acreage is drilled up, but that slowdown hasn’t shown up yet — and we think it still has room to run. Producers are under constant pressure to do more with less, especially when crude prices soften. Furthermore, an aging well base means more production is coming from flatter parts of the decline curve — fewer new wells are needed to make up for legacy well declines. So forget the old 1:1 link between rigs and production. Our prognostication for 2026? Fewer rigs will support more crude oil output — a trend likely to continue for several more years.

3. Still More Hype Than Mcfs in Natural Gas for Data Centers.

We are going to stay contrarian on this one until proved wrong by the data. Last year we asserted that the hype around gas-fired power for data centers was getting way ahead of itself. Yep, natural gas demand for power generation actually fell by a couple of percent in 2025, with renewables displacing gas. But the hype continued to intensify during 2025, with some forecasts suggesting data centers could drive domestic gas demand for power higher on the order of 10-12 Bcf/d by 2030. Could that happen? We don’t think so. Optimistically, maybe half of those numbers will happen. We lump the obstacles to astronomical growth into four buckets. First, gas is likely to supply only about half of new data-center power demand, with the rest coming from renewables and the existing grid (including coal, nuclear and hydro). Second, data-center construction itself will likely fall short of projections due to constraints on hardware, labor, pipeline capacity and permitting. Third, data-center utilization will not run at full capacity 24/7 for several reasons, including uneven workloads, power and cooling constraints, and active load management. In addition, energy use per server is likely to decline as AI shifts from being dominated by energy-intensive training to less-intensive usage (what techies call “inference,” meaning asking questions and getting answers). Finally, maybe some of AI really is a bubble, and will struggle to recover the hundreds of billions in investment dollars. Don’t read this wrong. There will definitely be a significant increase in natural gas consumption coming from AI and other power-sector demand. Just not enough to singlehandedly blow the socks off the gas market.

2. Natural Gas Will Support Another Good Year for Ethane.

The price of ethane in 2025 was the highest since 2022 at 25.3 c/gal, mostly due to higher natural gas prices, which support ethane due to rejection economics. (Ethane not needed by U.S. crackers or the export market is rejected and sold as gas on a Btu-equivalent basis, so ethane should not fall below the price of gas — at least most of the time.) But compared to natural gas on a Btu basis, in 2025 ethane was the cheapest in 10 years, only 1.1X versus 1.4X in 2023, and 1.6X in 2018. In 2026, ethane should enjoy more support from natural gas, while the ratio of ethane to gas should stay about the same. Increasing production should push ethane lower relative to gas, but increasing exports and the startup of CPChem/QatarEnergy’s Golden Triangle Polymers ethane cracker (late 2026 or early 2027) will keep the ethane-to-gas ratio about the same as 2025 (1.1X). So if 2026 natural gas turns out to average $4.25/MMBtu (RBN’s MID scenario), then ethane would average 30.9 c/gal, a 22% year-on-year increase (based on ethane at 65,897 Btu/gal). There’s your 2026 price prognostication for the year: Ethane prices will see a 5.5 c/gal increase over 2025!",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2026-01/2026%20Year%20of%20the%20Horse.png?itok=vDxvjwJm,N,,2026-01-01 22:12:41.235364

CHENNAI: Battery electric vehicle penetration in India's two-wheeler and passenger vehicle segments lost momentum in 2025 after the reduction in GST rates for petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles from Oct, even as EV volumes saw healthy growth for the year. The narrowed price gap between internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs after GST reduction led to a spike in ICE sales in the Dec quarter, weighing on EV market share. The three-wheeler (3W) segment, however, stood out as an exception, recording an improvement in penetration levels during the year. In the two-wheeler (2W) segment, penetration of battery-powered vehicles rose from 6% in 2024 to a peak of 8.1% during the Jan-Sept 2025 period. However, a lower EV share in the Dec quarter, which was the first post-GST rate-cut quarter led to overall E2W penetration for 2025 to be 6.3%. Similarly, EV penetration (excluding hybrid models) in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, including cars and SUVs, improved from 2.5% in 2024 to nearly 4% for the year. In contrast, electric three-wheeler penetration (excluding e-rickshaws) increased sharply from 12% in 2024 to 18% in 2025. Despite the pressure on penetration, EV sales growth remained robust across segments. Total registrations of battery-powered EVs-including 2W, 3W, cars and SUVs-rose 16% year-on-year to 22.7 lakh units in 2025, up from 19.5 lakh units in 2024, Vahan data showed. The electric two-wheeler segment reported an 11% increase in volumes to 12.8 lakh units in 2025, up from 11.5 lakh units a year earlier. The electric PV segment (excluding hybrids) delivered the strongest performance, with registrations surging 77% to 1.8 lakh units from about 99,500 units in 2024, aided by aggressive expansion by existing players and the entry of new manufacturers. Electric three-wheeler volumes grew 15% year-on-year to 8 lakh units, compared with 6.9 lakh units in 2024, with e-rickshaws accounting for around 70% of total E3W sales during the year.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to US$67 million.
“What I fear is that we are not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said.
For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places such as North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere.
“Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right”.","[PORTLAND] The Millers are a family of beekeepers in Gackle, North Dakota, a tiny farming town about 113 kilometres (70 miles) east of Bismarck. It was five decades ago when they began their labours here amid the endless swaths of sweet clover, alfalfa and the variety of other plant life that bees thrive on.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to US$67 million. All of it courtesy of these undulating fields of wild grasses, and the buzzing insects who return to them each year.

“It was bee paradise,” said Jason Miller.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it’s the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a US renewable fuel standard in part to decrease dependence on foreign oil. In 2021, president Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of three billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for US corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

Biofuels also can be made from animal fats, algae, waste cooking oils or agricultural waste such as wood chips and straw. While the US Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope is a fait accompli.

In the last year, US production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House, the Trump administration just unfroze a US$1.67 billion Biden-era loan for biofuel processing plants.

The downside of making jet biofuel from corn or soybean production is that it will likely fuel significant land transformation, according to several expert analyses, including one by Braden Limb, a research scientist at Colorado State University. According to his study, about 50 per cent more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet the 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we have converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb. And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment-and people such as Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a US$400 million paid US pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybees populations already face a number of stressors-disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: only a year ago US beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, according to an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to to corn.

“What I fear is that we are not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

But as demand for air travel soars, so does aviation’s climate impact. According to the International Air Travel Association, air traffic rose more than 10 per cent between 2023 and 2024, making it one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation contributes roughly 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions but is responsible for at least 3.5 per cent of human-caused climate change.

Airlines have been exploring the few options available to lower emissions, including SAF. The industry has committed to biofuel use and the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would require significant biofuel inputs. Researchers such as Limb point to crops other than corn or soybeans, like sorghum and miscanthus, that can be used for biofuel but aren’t as damaging to ecosystems.

“All of our optimisation work,” Limb said, “says corn and soybeans are not the answer.”

There are forces at work that may yet forestall the mass repurposing of grasslands for biofuel. In 2022, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, created by Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, crafted more incentives for domestic production and sale of low-carbon transportation fuels. But the Republican tax and spending bill passed this summer, while extending the credit, decreased the US$1.75 per gallon credit for SAF to US$1. Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clear-cutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers.”

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialised equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF-including virgin vegetable oils-are typically more expensive than other biofuels. “Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies continue to express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in petrol blends used in land transportation, organisations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

Another driver of aviation biofuel is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), an initiative that aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions from international flights. Corsia is a three-phase international agreement-the first two phases were voluntary, but beginning in 2027, Corsia becomes mandatory for most of international aviation, with some exceptions. Under the agreement, airlines must measure, report, verify and offset emissions that exceed the 2019 baseline.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places such as North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.

Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels”, said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the US biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that the US exported almost two billion gallons of corn ethanol last year. “If US exports decline,” he said, “then we will need to find ways to increase domestic consumption-increasing land use change pressure”.

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources-used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes-could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear, widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market, you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

Back in North Dakota, Klett said beekeeping families such as hers and the Millers remain worried about what comes after that uncertainty lifts. “Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right”.

BEIJING — Chinese auto giant BYD sold 2.26 million electric vehicles last year, a company statement showed Thursday, setting a new record for any firm globally.

The figure puts BYD in pole position to outstrip Elon Musk's Tesla in the annual category for the first time, with the lagging Texas-based firm having previously announced 1.22 million in 2025 EV sales by the end of September.

Tesla is expected to announce its total EV sales for last year on Friday.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, announced the data in a statement published to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it is listed.

Known as ""Biyadi"" in Chinese, or by the English slogan ""Build Your Dreams"", BYD was founded in 1995, originally specialising in battery manufacturing.

The automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive new energy vehicle market, the world's largest.

Now it is seeking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.

BYD and its Chinese competitors face hefty tariffs in the United States.

But its success is growing in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and even Europe, to the consternation of traditional industry heavyweights from the continent.

Tesla narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with US company's 1.79 million just outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.

2025 was a year of turmoil for many scientists — particularly in the United States, where job cuts and budget slashing have left many reeling. But it was also a year of promising advances in fields from gene therapy to quantum computing.

In the U.S., executive orders by President Donald Trump led to the loss of thousands of jobs in government agencies, including NASA, which oversees space exploration, and NOAA, which runs the National Weather Service, among other vital activities. Thousands of health-related research grants — especially those with any perceived link to diversity, equity and inclusion — were canceled or withheld. And Harvard and other universities saw billions of dollars held back, at least temporarily.

Trump’s budget proposal for 2026 (the U.S. budget had not been finalized as Knowable Magazine went to press) features huge cuts to science funding, including slicing the budget for the National Science Foundation, the main granting agency for basic science research, in half. And cuts that have already been made spell bad news for global efforts to quash diseases and keep climate change in check.

Amid all the bad news, there have also been lives saved, technologies advanced and some very weird science conducted. Here are some of the things that captured Knowable’s attention in 2025.

Vaccine hits and misses

Public health faced big challenges this year. “There have been enormous changes in 2025, really driven by the current [U.S.] administration and their attitude towards both foreign aid and domestic vaccine policy,” says epidemiologist William Moss at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and coauthor of an Annual Review of Public Health article on global vaccinations. The U.S. withdrew from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2025, for example, and said it would pull funding from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Experts are worried that increasing gaps in vaccination coverage will contribute to further outbreaks of infectious diseases previously thought to be under control. This year, for example, measles surged in North America: Canada lost its “measles elimination” status in November, with cases much higher than anything seen in decades, and the U.S. may follow in 2026. Whooping cough is also on the rise.

Over the past 50 years, immunization has saved an estimated 154 million lives globally. Maintaining that is proving hard. The 2020 pandemic caused disruptions to vaccination campaigns, and many have not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Part of the problem is growing anti-vax sentiments. In the United States, vaccine coverage in kindergartners has crept downward from around 95% to 92% over the past dozen years, with exemptions from one or more recommended vaccines reaching a record high of 3.6% in the 2024-25 school year. These trends could signal trouble ahead.

There is some good news. After three years of negotiation, delegates to the WHO (not including the U.S.) adopted a Pandemic Agreement with a better system for equitably sharing vaccines and drugs. Coverage with the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine, which protects against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer in women and some throat cancers in men, continues to increase. And despite the cancellation of $500 million in funding for messenger RNA (mRNA) research in the United States, researchers are increasingly enthusiastic about mRNA vaccines, following on their success during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early research suggests that mRNA vaccines could be particularly promising in the fight against cancer.

HIV hope — and setbacks

This year saw some good news on the HIV front. Experimental infusions of neutralizing antibodies allowed some people with HIV to achieve remissions lasting months or years without the usual daily doses of antiretroviral drugs. And in July, the WHO endorsed twice-a-year injections of a long-lasting, highly effective injectable drug called lenacapavir for HIV prevention, following on the heels of U.S. approval for that use. Experts say this marks a momentous shift for people at risk of HIV. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing.”

These new treatments may be especially valuable given the Trump administration’s decision this year to dismantle programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This includes the disruptions to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that delivered a huge and shocking blow to the global HIV/AIDS effort this year. As a result, the United Nations effort UNAIDS — to which USAID used to be the largest donor — could be shuttered in 2026, four years ahead of schedule.

All this has left experts and advocates reeling, as the number of people living with HIV — still one of the world’s most deadly viruses — continues to climb. UNAIDS predicts that if the PEPFAR funds permanently disappear, there could be over 6 million additional HIV infections and an additional 4 million AIDS-related deaths by 2029. “The sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,” said UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima at a press briefing in March. “It is very serious.”

Spectacular space advances

Astronomers rejoiced as the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory, built atop a mountain in Chile, came online this year. The telescope hosts the world’s biggest camera, at 3.2 billion pixels, and is expected to gather more data in its first year than all previous optical telescopes combined. The project aims to catalog some 5 million asteroids, including 100,000 near-Earth objects, over the next decade. It will also help to study dark matter and objects such as supernovae, and pursue new discoveries, including optical signals of gravitational waves. “The Rubin Observatory promises to impact virtually every area of astronomy and astrophysics, often profoundly,” says astronomer Robert Kennicutt at the University of Arizona, coeditor of the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Among the more unusual targets that Rubin will help to spot are interstellar objects — hunks of rock or ice blasting through our solar system from elsewhere. So far, astronomers have only detected three such objects, including 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Earth in December. It is suspected that there are many more to find; Rubin could spot dozens over the next decade.

Personalized gene editing gets started

Since the first gene therapy treatment based on CRISPR — which uses molecular scissors to precisely cut and modify DNA — was approved in 2023 for sickle cell disease, efforts to develop other treatments have ramped up. Therapies are under investigation for a host of conditions including type 1 diabetes, various cancers and even high cholesterol.

But the big headline this year was the first personalized gene therapy: A baby boy with a life-threatening genetic condition became the first to receive a customized therapy, using a CRISPR-based technique that can precisely edit individual DNA letters. Personalized CRISPR treatments could allow doctors to effectively treat people suffering from rare or even unique life-threatening conditions. Such diseases collectively affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

The team behind the baby boy’s successful procedure announced this October their intention to try similar treatments in more children starting in 2026, and in November, the Food and Drug Administration launched a new pathway to market for these procedures. A Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures in California was also created in July to help families facing ultra-rare diseases. Funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the center will be led by researchers at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. “I know firsthand the heartbreak of telling parents that we don’t understand their child’s illness or that we don’t know how to treat them,” Priscilla Chan, pediatrician and co-CEO of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said in a press release about the new center.

Hopes raised for more transplants

This year brought important progress for xenotransplantation, the practice of using donor organs from pigs or other animals for people who need transplants. While only a handful of people have so far received pig hearts or kidneys — in special cases where they had no other options — those cases are blazing a trail toward making this technique a clinical reality. “The numbers are small but mighty,” says Joseph Ladowski, a surgeon and researcher in transplant immunology at Duke University.

This year brought several experimental transplants of pig organs (including the first lung), with one pig kidney lasting nearly nine months, a new record, before failing. Most importantly, in February the FDA green-lit the first multiperson trials of pig kidney transplants, which will allow doctors to standardize and optimize the technique. We should see half a dozen more transplants of animal organs in 2026, says Ladowski, with numbers ramping up steeply after that.

Another exciting development happening in parallel may also help ease the global shortage of donor organs: using an enzyme to convert the blood type of donated organs, removing antigens that can result in rejection in both human and animal transplants. In October, a team reported the first transplant of a human kidney that had its blood type converted from type A to universal donor type O.

Potential treatment for Huntington’s disease

This year, researchers reported a small but promising study in which they slowed the progression of Huntington’s disease, an inherited disorder that gradually breaks down neurons, causing uncontrollable movements and a progressive degradation of behavior and thought. The treatment, by the Amsterdam-based company uniQure, is the first to address the disease itself rather than simply easing its symptoms.

Researchers engineered a harmless virus to deliver small molecules called microRNAs designed to block the action of the defective gene that causes Huntington’s. Then they infused the virus into targeted regions of the brains of 29 patients. In those who got the higher of two doses, the treatment slowed the progression of the disease by 75%, the team found. The result is “a remarkable step forward for patients and families,” says Andreas Keller, a bioinformatician at Saarland University in Germany who studies potential clinical applications of microRNAs. “This is a convincing proof-of-concept.”

As the climate crisis deepens, renewables get energized

This year continued the growing momentum of the renewable energy transition, thanks in large part to the plummeting cost of solar power. According to an October report from the think tank Ember, the first half of 2025 saw renewable energy provide more than a third of global electricity, squeaking ahead of coal for the first time.

But that’s rare good news in a grim climate picture. U.S. policy, notably, is generally moving against renewable energy: In a speech to the United Nations in September, President Donald Trump said, “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail.”

Worldwide efforts to fight climate change are seriously off target, according to the UN Environment Programme. Global emissions of carbon dioxide may have declined slightly in 2025, but they need to be falling much faster if we are to hit our climate targets. Experts now say we will miss the goal of limiting the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but action can still help to stave off catastrophic consequences to ecology and humankind. “Every small fraction of a degree matters,” says Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, an environmental scientist and climate expert at Central European University and vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The latest data put 2025 as the second- or third-hottest year on record, after record-breaking 2024, with an annual average temperature about 1.48 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average.

Porous metals come of age

A class of materials called metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hit the headlines this year with Nobel Prize recognition, along with the first signs of commercial applications. MOFs are the world’s most porous materials: crystals of metal ions linked by long organic molecules. Their porosity could make these molecular sponges useful as storage containers for gases or drugs.

“MOFs are very elegant, scientifically, and highly versatile,” says Ram Seshadri, a chemist and materials scientist at UC Santa Barbara and editor of the Annual Review of Materials Research.

Although they have been a scientific curiosity for decades, MOFs are now starting to gain traction in applications — in part because artificial intelligence has massively sped up the hunt for new MOF formulations with desired properties, and in part because of increased interest in sucking carbon dioxide out of the air to fight climate change. This May, a company launched a new factory for making MOF sponges to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air. Others are investigating using MOFs to harvest water from the air in desert regions, store hydrogen gas to use as a zero-carbon fuel, and even deliver drugs within the body.

Quantum computing gears up

Quantum computing made significant progress this year. Quantum computers are built from qubits, which exploit quantum behaviors to offer faster computation but are also inherently unstable and error-prone. To make a practically useful quantum computer, designers have to create a multi-qubit system that produces a lower overall error rate than seen in the individual bits. There have been a few recent practical demonstrations of this “quantum error correction” process. And then in October, Google announced that its “quantum echoes” algorithm proved 13,000 times faster than a classical computer at predicting molecular structures — one of the first potentially practical applications.

That’s not the only quantum computing news this year. The 2025 Nobel Prize in physics went to some of the foundational research for quantum computing (fittingly, given that 2025 was also UNESCO’s International Year of Quantum Science and Technology). “Quantum computing is definitely accelerating,” says William Oliver, a quantum engineer at MIT. “It’s pretty exciting.”

Pollution perils stack up

The global effort to manage pollution faced big setbacks this year. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced more than 30 acts of deregulation, many aiming to remove controls it claims were “throttling” the oil and gas industries. In August, the EPA proposed rescinding its foundational 2009 Endangerment Finding, which concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are air pollutants that endanger public welfare. Rescinding the finding would eliminate the legal basis for the EPA’s climate-based regulations. A long list of rules being rolled back is being compiled by Harvard University’s environmental and energy law program, while the Natural Resources Defense Council is tracking canceled and frozen environmental funding.

On the international stage, a hoped-for treaty to end plastic pollution fell apart this summer as participants fought over the scope of what the treaty could reasonably cover and the strength of its promises. While negotiations are expected to resume at some point in the future, for now it is up to individual governments to set their own rules for reducing plastic pollution.

Meanwhile, controversial efforts to mine the ocean bottom for minerals took a step forward despite studies showing negative impacts of test mining on seafloor life. Mining in international waters falls under the purview of the International Seabed Authority, which is developing a Mining Code to regulate this activity. But in April, the Metals Company sidestepped this process by seeking a permit directly from the United States, which has not ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that governs the seabed authority. Trump issued an executive order in April to fast-track such mining applications. A final decision is still pending.

Mighty mitochondria: More than just powerhouses

The term “mitochondrial dysfunction” featured heavily in headlines this year as politicians and researchers alike leaned in to the idea that malfunctions of this subcellular structure may underlie chronic diseases ranging from Parkinson’s to cancer, diabetes and more. “It’s becoming more and more recognized that once you perturb mitochondria, a whole bunch of diseases can occur,” says Andrew Dillin, a molecular and cell biologist at the University of California, Berkeley.

Mitochondria, long called “the powerhouses of cells” because they convert nutrients into chemical fuel, turn out to do much more than that. In particular, these little structures inside our cells — which probably evolved from ancient bacteria — have retained their ancient abilities to communicate, making them a major hub for cell signaling and a big player in regulating stress, immunity and metabolism.

Work this year showed that they can, for example, act as a “watchtower” against bacterial infection, detecting invading pathogens and helping the immune system mount a response. Mitochondria seem to be critical for memory formation in immune T cells, have an unexpected role in tissue healing, and might be targeted to help us live healthier for longer in old age.

And finally …

A couple of fun science stories that captured the world’s attention early this year are worth noting, even though some observers have poured cold water on the findings.

In April, Texas-based Colossal Biosciences announced it had genetically re-created dire wolves, a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America more than 11,000 years ago. To be precise, the company made 20 genetic tweaks to 14 locations in the genome of gray wolves. Debate erupted about whether this really amounts to re-creating dire wolves, which are thought to differ from gray wolves by about 12 million letters of DNA. (Most experts say no.)

The work “marks a technical achievement in genome editing and synthetic embryology,” wrote stem cell biologist Dusko Ilic from King’s College London in a commentary. But, he adds, “what has been achieved is not resurrection, but simulation.” Work continues to “de-extinct” other animals, from the dodo to the woolly mammoth. Whether this is achievable or desirable is a matter of opinion. Other genetic techniques are also being used to try to save living species on the brink of extinction, such as the northern white rhino.

Another quirky headline-grabbing story came when scientists made people see a color no one had ever experienced before. Researchers used a laser to directly stimulate just one of the three types of color-sensitive cone cells in the retina: the M cone, which is most sensitive to medium-wavelength light. That never happens in the real world, because any light that stimulates the M cone would also stimulate the neighboring S (short) and L (long) cones to some degree. The five people who experienced this odd light show said the result looked “green-blue,” a color dubbed “olo” by the researchers. The work is a fun exploration of the weird and wonderful world of color perception.",https://www.edhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/knowable-top-science-stories-of-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 18:58:10.356408

Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) and Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) emerged as the primary beneficiaries of this shift, each offering a distinct pathway to energy independence for data center operators. As we enter 2026, the choice between these two stocks defines the broader tension between immediate reliability and long-term exponential growth.

The Year of the ""Grid Gap"": A 2025 Retrospective

The year 2025 was marked by a series of landmark agreements that validated the decentralization of the American power grid. Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) transitioned from a clean-energy alternative to a critical infrastructure provider, capped by a massive $5 billion partnership with Brookfield Asset Management. This deal, announced in late 2025, positioned Bloom as the preferred on-site power provider for Brookfield’s global network of AI factories. Throughout the year, Bloom’s ability to deploy fuel cell capacity in as little as 90 days allowed it to bypass the multi-year interconnection queues that have crippled traditional utility expansion.

Meanwhile, Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) spent 2025 shattering regulatory expectations. Despite being a pre-revenue company, Oklo’s valuation soared as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) adopted an ""accelerated timeline"" for its licensing process. In September 2025, the NRC accepted Oklo’s Principal Design Criteria (PDC) report in just 15 days—a process that historically took months. This regulatory tailwind, combined with the benefits of the ADVANCE Act which slashed licensing fees by over 50%, moved Oklo’s 2027 commercial deployment target from a speculative dream to a tangible project timeline.

The market reaction was nothing short of explosive. Bloom Energy’s stock finished 2025 up nearly 300%, trading in the $85 to $90 range by year-end, while Oklo saw a 250% gain, peaking at $120 before consolidating around $60. These moves were supported by a broader industry realization: the traditional grid is no longer sufficient for the AI era. Key players like American Electric Power (NASDAQ: AEP) and Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX) became central to this narrative, signing massive master service agreements to integrate these non-traditional power sources directly into their infrastructure.

Winners, Losers, and the Battle for the Data Center

In this evolving landscape, Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) enters 2026 as the ""safe"" play for investors seeking immediate cash flow. Having reported four consecutive quarters of record revenue and positive free cash flow in 2025, Bloom has silenced critics who long questioned its path to profitability. The company is currently on track to double its manufacturing capacity to 2 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2026. For data center giants like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Bloom offers a ""plug-and-play"" solution that provides immediate relief from the power shortages currently stalling GPU cluster expansions.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), conversely, represents the ""high-beta"" bet on the future of energy. With a customer pipeline that ballooned to over 14 GW by the end of 2025, the company’s potential is vast, but its risks remain tied to the bureaucratic gears of the NRC. The winners in the Oklo story are the long-term visionaries—companies like Liberty Energy (NYSE: LBRT) and Vertiv (NYSE: VRT) that have partnered with Oklo to secure future energy density that fuel cells simply cannot match at scale.

The primary ""losers"" in this scenario are the legacy utilities that failed to modernize. As major industrial customers move ""behind-the-meter"" with Bloom or Oklo, traditional power providers face a ""utility death spiral"" where their most profitable customers exit the grid, leaving a smaller base to pay for aging infrastructure. Investors have begun rotating out of slow-growth utility ETFs and into the ""Power Infrastructure"" cohort, where Bloom and Oklo sit at the very top.

The Broader Significance: Decoupling from the Grid

The rise of BE and OKLO is not just a story of two successful stocks; it is a symptom of a broader industrial decoupling. The 2025 energy crisis proved that the centralized grid is a single point of failure for the AI economy. This has led to a policy shift in Washington, where the 2025 Executive Orders streamlined permitting for reactors on federal land and provided tax credits for hydrogen-ready fuel cells. These regulatory shifts have created a permanent floor for the valuations of companies that can provide ""islanded"" power solutions.

Historically, this shift mirrors the transition from mainframe computing to distributed PC networks. Just as computing moved from centralized rooms to every desk, power is moving from centralized plants to every data center campus. This trend has significant ripple effects on the supply chain. Companies specializing in cooling technology and power management, such as Vertiv (NYSE: VRT), have seen their fortunes rise in tandem with Bloom and Oklo, as the complexity of managing on-site power plants requires advanced digital infrastructure.

Furthermore, the competition between fuel cells and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) is driving rapid innovation. In 2025, Bloom Energy successfully demonstrated 100% hydrogen-ready fuel cells at scale, while Oklo finalized its fuel fabrication plans using recycled nuclear waste. This technological arms race is accelerating the global transition to carbon-free energy, not because of environmental mandates, but because of the sheer economic necessity of the AI revolution.

What Comes Next: The 2026 Catalysts

Looking ahead at the remainder of 2026, several key catalysts will determine if these stocks can maintain their momentum. For Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), the focus is entirely on execution and margin expansion. Investors will be watching the completion of the 2 GW manufacturing expansion; any delays in scaling could hurt the stock’s premium valuation. The conversion of the $5 billion Brookfield backlog into recognized revenue will be the primary metric for success in the first half of the year.

For Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), 2026 is a ""make-or-break"" regulatory year. The market is currently pricing in a successful Draft Safety Evaluation from the NRC, expected in the second quarter. If Oklo receives a favorable report, it will de-risk the 2027 deployment of its first Aurora powerhouse in Idaho, potentially sending the stock toward the $100 mark again. However, any regulatory ""hiccup"" or request for additional data could lead to significant volatility, as the company remains pre-revenue and dependent on investor sentiment.

Strategic pivots may also be on the horizon. We may see Bloom Energy move more aggressively into the hydrogen economy as infrastructure for the fuel matures, while Oklo could announce further partnerships with sovereign wealth funds looking to power national AI initiatives. The emergence of ""Energy-as-a-Service"" (EaaS) models will likely become the standard for how these companies contract with Big Tech, moving away from capital-heavy sales to long-term, high-margin power purchase agreements.

Investor Takeaway: Scaling vs. Speculation

As of January 1, 2026, the energy sector has been permanently bifurcated. Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) stands as the champion of the ""Now,"" providing the essential power that is currently keeping the AI revolution from hitting a wall. With a consensus ""Buy"" rating and a price target of $117.50, it is the preferred choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to the AI infrastructure trade with the safety of proven earnings.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) remains the champion of the ""Next."" It is a speculative powerhouse that offers the only realistic solution for the massive energy requirements of 2030 and beyond. While its $85.00 median price target suggests significant upside, it is a stock for those with a high risk tolerance and a long-term horizon. The ""AI Power Rush"" is far from over, and in 2026, the winners will be those who can provide the most electrons in the shortest amount of time.

Investors should closely monitor monthly NRC filings for Oklo and quarterly backlog conversion rates for Bloom. In a world where ""compute is the new oil,"" these two companies are the new refineries. The transition to decentralized, high-density power is the defining investment theme of the decade, and the 2025 performance of BE and OKLO was merely the opening act.

The Pettit National Ice Center is an official training site for U.S. Speedskating.","The Pettit National Ice Center has made Milwaukee a destination for the Olympic speedskating world. Now, the first indoor speedskating oval built in the U.S. is going solar.

The arena contains enough ice to fill more than five National Hockey League rinks. Like most ice centers, it requires a significant amount of energy to keep its skating surface frozen and dry.

The solar project will cut the 200,000-square-foot facility’s energy use by at least 20 percent and power the building during summer months.

It’s funded by a large donation gifted to the nonprofit by the climate-focused VoLo Foundation.

Paul Golomski is the Pettit Ice Center’s general manager. He believes the project will help the facility use energy more responsibly.

“There’s only five (indoor speedskating ovals) in North America, and there’s only 40 operating in the entire world,” Golomski said. “So I think it’s a really smart thing for us to invest in and to ensure that we’re being responsible stewards of our energy consumption.”

He says over a 20-year period, the system will have the impact of reducing the center’s CO2 emissions by 12,778 tons. That’s equal to 191,000 trees planted, or 29,053,530 miles driven by cars.

Milwaukee-based renewable energy company Arch Solar is leading the project — a 690 kilowatt system consisting of 1,200 bifacial solar panels. This allows each panel to absorb sunlight from its front and back sides, producing more energy.

Andrew Holmstrom is the business development supervisor at Arch Solar. He said the panels will generate enough energy to power a string of Christmas lights from Milwaukee to North Carolina.

“It’s going to be a clean, green rooftop power plant,” Holmstrom said.

Holmstrom previously lived across the highway from the ice center.

“I’ve been able to skate on the ice there, run inside there, and so to be able to be a part of this project and kind of leave our fingerprint on the building, it means so much,” Holmstrom said.

Arch Solar has been on the roof since late November. They hope to have it ready by early April.

The Pettit National Ice Center is an official training site for U.S. Speedskating. It opened in 1992. The facility will host the U.S. Olympic Team Trials Long Track competition Jan. 2-5.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Roofphoto25-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 16:12:49.906007

Wicker chairs a vastly different SASC in a very different Congress than did Stennis,Not Available,,,,,https://www.tallahatchienews.ms/sen-wicker-chairs-vastly-different-sasc-very-different-congress-did-stennis-6956d76b51db6,"Two men, more than any others, shaped that reality: the late Democratic U.S. Sen. John C. Stennis and the current GOP U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker.
Both chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC).
Both left fingerprints all over Mississippi’s defense economy.
As Armed Services chairman, Wicker is not building entirely new federal cities, as Stennis once did.
Under Wicker, Mississippi installations have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in military construction, infrastructure resilience, and readiness upgrades.","Below is an opinion column by Sid Salter:

Columnist Sid Salter says in both eras, Mississippi benefited from a senator who understood defense not just as policy, but as economic reality.

Mississippi has enjoyed an outsized role in national defense for most of the modern era. From World War II airfields to Cold War shipyards to today’s cyber, space, and naval missions, the Magnolia State has long punched above its weight in the Pentagon’s ledger.

Two men, more than any others, shaped that reality: the late Democratic U.S. Sen. John C. Stennis and the current GOP U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker. Both chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC). Both left fingerprints all over Mississippi’s defense economy. But they did so in very different ways, in very different Washingtons, under vastly different political rules in a wildly different Congress.

The question Mississippi taxpayers ought to ask isn’t which man was “better,” but whether the state is faring about as well under Wicker as it did under Stennis—given the times and circumstances in which each man served.

John Stennis was a creature of the old Senate. He rose through seniority, mastered the committee system, and exercised power quietly. When Stennis spoke, people leaned in. When he nodded, budgets moved. He didn’t give fiery speeches. He didn’t chase headlines. He worked behind closed doors and let results speak for themselves.

Those results were substantial. During Stennis’ tenure—especially as Armed Services chairman from 1969 to 1981—Mississippi saw foundational federal investments that still anchor the state’s economy today. The Mississippi Test Facility, later renamed the John C. Stennis Space Center, was among the most significant federal construction projects in state history. Keesler Air Force Base, Columbus Air Force Base, Camp Shelby, the Seabee base in Gulfport, and the Meridian Naval Air Station all grew and stabilized during the Cold War years when defense dollars flowed freely.

That era favored big footprints: more troops, more ships, more bases. Mississippi benefited because Stennis sat at the choke point of authorization and appropriations in a Congress where committee chairmen were kings. If you were a Mississippi taxpayer, you were getting a solid return on your federal tax dollar — especially if you lived near a base or shipyard.

Roger Wicker operates in a different universe entirely.

Today’s Senate is fragmented. Power is shared among leadership, committees, factions, and cable news. No chairman can simply dictate outcomes. Every defense bill requires coalition-building, messaging, and annual survival. In that environment, Wicker’s style is necessarily more public, more strategic, and more overtly national in scope.

As Armed Services chairman, Wicker is not building entirely new federal cities, as Stennis once did. Instead, he is protecting, modernizing, and integrating Mississippi’s existing defense assets to align with 21st-century military priorities. Under Wicker, Mississippi installations have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in military construction, infrastructure resilience, and readiness upgrades.

Stennis Space Center has been reaffirmed not just as a NASA asset, but as a joint federal campus supporting naval, maritime, and research missions. Shipbuilding and naval systems on the Gulf Coast are tied directly to national priorities for submarines, destroyers, and special operations craft.

The money flows differently now. It’s less dramatic, more incremental. But it is also more targeted and, arguably, more durable.

Mississippi’s defense industries have also changed. Under Stennis, the focus was on heavy construction, manpower, and large platforms. Under Wicker, the emphasis is on advanced manufacturing, autonomous systems, cyber operations, and technologies — industries that may employ fewer people directly but generate higher-skill jobs and longer-term relevance.

Adjusted for inflation, politics, and the global threat environment, Mississippi has fared well under both SASC chairmen—though it looks different. Stennis delivered expansion. Wicker delivers sustainment and modernization. Stennis brought Mississippi into the big leagues of defense. Wicker is keeping it there while both the rules and the game itself change.

Wicker has challenged Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the recent alleged drug boat bombings off the coast of Venezuela – something Stennis did to Defense Secretary Melvin Laird after U.S. incursions into Cambodia in 1970.

What hasn’t changed is Mississippi’s dependence on strong representation at the Armed Services table. In both eras, the state benefited from a senator who understood defense not just as policy, but as economic reality.",https://www.tallahatchienews.ms/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_post/public/02-03-2021%20Sid%20Salter_117_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 16:12:39.261560

By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.
For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere.","The Millers are a family of beekeepers in Gackle, North Dakota, a tiny farming town about 70 miles east of Bismarck. It was five decades ago when they began their labors here amid the endless swaths of sweet clover, alfalfa and the variety of other plant life that bees thrive on.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to $67 million. All of it courtesy of these undulating fields of wild grasses, and the buzzing insects who return to them each year.

“It was bee paradise,” said Jason Miller.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it’s the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

In 2021, President Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of 3 billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for US corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

While the US Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce SAF, the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope

In the last year, US production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House

According to his study, about 50% more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we’ve converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb.

And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment—and people like Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a $400 million paid US pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybee populations already face a number of stressors—disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: just one year ago US beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, according to an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to corn.

“What I fear is that we’re not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clearcutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers.”

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialized equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF—including virgin vegetable oils—are typically more expensive than other biofuels. “Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel, given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in gasoline blends used in land transportation, organizations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels,” said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov. 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the US biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources—used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes—could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear, widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right.”

According to the European Commission, geothermal energy is a renewable energy source harnessed from the thermal energy stored in rocks and fluids deep within the Earth’s crust.
Unlike solar and wind that depend on the weather, geothermal power can run at all hours of the day, making it a highly attractive renewable energy source.
In May, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced plans to implement emergency permitting procedures to accelerate assessments of geothermal energy projects across the country, in line with President Trump’s energy agenda.
“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at the time.","Geothermal is one of the few renewable energy sectors that President Donald Trump has not tried to quash in favour of fossil fuels in the United States. There is significant promise for the future of geothermal power in the United States, even though most projects are still in the nascent stage of development. Both public and private funding are expected to bolster the sector in the coming years.

According to the European Commission, geothermal energy is a renewable energy source harnessed from the thermal energy stored in rocks and fluids deep within the Earth’s crust. Drilled wells connect the fluid to the earth’s surface, allowing it to be used for a range of purposes such as to generate electricity or provide direct heat for district heating, water heating or industrial processes.

Countries with easily accessible geothermal reserves have been harvesting power from these sources for centuries. Meanwhile, countries with harder-to-reach reserves can now use enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) to access vast, clean power sources. EGS is based on technology used in fracking operations, which emerged over the last century. Unlike solar and wind that depend on the weather, geothermal power can run at all hours of the day, making it a highly attractive renewable energy source.

In May, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced plans to implement emergency permitting procedures to accelerate assessments of geothermal energy projects across the country, in line with President Trump’s energy agenda. Projects selected for fast-tracking included three in Nevada, operated by Ormat, which received funding during President Trump’s first term in office in 2020. The move is expected to reduce approval times from months or even years to a maximum of just 28 days for energy or mining projects on federal lands that are deemed urgent.

“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at the time. “We’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”

In December, U.S. geothermal energy leader Fervo Energy announced it had raised $462 million in its Series E funding round to accelerate growth and support the ongoing construction of Cape Station and early development of several other projects. Cape Station in Utah is expected to deliver 100 MW of geothermal power to the grid starting in 2026, before expanding to 500 MW by 2028.

“Fervo is setting the pace for the next era of clean, affordable, and reliable power in the U.S.,” said Jeff Johnson, General Partner at B Capital. “With surging demand from AI and electrification, the grid urgently needs scalable, always-on solutions, and we believe enhanced geothermal energy is uniquely positioned to deliver.”

In New Haven, Connecticut, works have commenced on a geothermal energy network that will offer clean heating and cooling to the city’s Union Station and a new public housing development. It is the start of a project aimed at decarbonising all municipal buildings and transportation by the end of 2030.

“At the end of the day, you’re going to have the most efficient heating and cooling system available for our historic train station as well as roughly 1,000 units of housing,” said New Haven’s executive director of climate and sustainability, Steven Winter. ?“Anything we can help do to improve health outcomes and reduce climate change–causing emissions is really valuable.”

Nearby, at Yale University, development has started on a geothermal loop serving several science buildings. An energy bill that passed earlier this year and established a grant and loan programme is expected to spur the development of more thermal energy networks in the state.

However, it was in Framingham, Massachusetts, where the first utility-owned geothermal network in the United States came online in June 2024. In December, the Boston-based non-profit, the Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET), announced that it had been awarded an $8.6 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office. The funding will contribute to the expansion of an existing networked geothermal system. HEET’s existing project provides clean heating and cooling to around 140 residential and commercial customers.

“This award is an opportunity and a responsibility to clearly demonstrate and quantify the growth potential of geothermal network technology,” said HEET’s Executive Director Zeyneb Magavi, “Which we will do, together with our partners and colleagues on the project team and at GTO. This project also represents the continuation of a collaboration that began when HEET first pitched our idea of geothermal networks to gas utilities in 2017.”

There are high hopes for the United States geothermal energy industry, particularly as it is continuing to garner federal support under the Trump administration. The expansion of geothermal power projects across the country are expected to support decarbonisation aims and help reduce reliance on fossil fuels in the coming years.

It’s a largely reactionary election and Democrats should avoid making it about big ideas that they lack the power to carry out.","Happy New Year and good riddance to 2025. What a nasty year it was. I hope 2026 brings a bit of relief, though I suspect it will bring additional frustrations.

The country enters its 250th year at odds with itself. The high ideals that Thomas Jefferson articulated and that representatives of the thirteen original colonies ratified in the Declaration of Independence are being trampled. Those high-minded men would be appalled at the grifter in the White House and depressed to know that so many Americans support him.

Last year, I didn’t make any predictions. Instead, I wrote a post about our broken political system. The closest I made to predictions were warnings. I wrote:

“As 2024 draws to a close, we’re about start a new cycle of Republican incompetence. The GOP controls Congress by an even narrower majority and Trump’s only clear agenda is self-enrichment for his family and friends. Without another election in the offing, Trump is tossing MAGA overboard and lining up with the billionaires as open warfare breaks out between the racist and grifter wings of the GOP. He’s suddenly pro-immigration as long as it’s the immigrants who benefit people like his new BFF, Elon Musk.

In Congress next week, Mike Johnson may have to fight to keep his role as House Speaker. Another ugly brawl could damage him more even if he keeps his seat and further expose the GOP’s weakness as a governing party. If they can’t govern with the White House and both Houses of Congress, they’re essentially an impotent party.

As for Democrats, they need to figure out to talk to Americans who work for wages again. They no longer have a large, enthusiastic base. Voters support them more as the lesser of evils because Democrats have failed to articulate a clear vision of what they stand for and have failed to communicate what they’ve accomplished.”

Trump’s second term was worse than I imagined. The speed with which he and his arsonists acted shocked Democrats and Republicans alike. The grifters moved in quickly, selling pardons and using foreign policy for business deals, enriching those around the president with little regard for the welfare of the country. Trump’s random and unorthodox use of tariffs rattled the world economy. The isolationists alienated all of our western allies, strengthening Russia and leaving Ukraine more vulnerable.

Elon Musk’s brief tenure as Secretary of Slash and Burn broke much of the federal government. The abrupt end of USAID costs the lives of thousands of children. The dismantling of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought back childhood diseases that were almost extinct. DOGE eliminated oversight that prevents fraud and protects Americans while keeping Musk’s government contracts intact. They are plundering the government.

Trump is building paramilitary units under the guise of immigration enforcement. He’s hired a group of thugs to snatch people off the street, out of their homes, and from their jobs to throw them in gulags. The goal is to create fear in communities and scare people into self-deportation. Civil and human rights be damned. Even if you believe we need to deport a lot of people, the methods used by these paramilitary units run contrary to the core values of our nation.

Finally, Trump is attempting to rebrand as much of the country with his name as possible. He’s renamed the Kennedy Center for himself. He’s also taken over municipal golf courses in Washington that he will likely name after himself. As we move toward the July 4th celebration, expect him to make more monuments to himself. He clearly sees the country as his.

That’s my wrap of 2025 at the national level. Now, for my predictions. In 2026, we’ll see a continuation of the worst of Trump’s abuses. He’ll escalate his deportation program and begin trying to strip citizenship away from naturalized citizens. The paramilitary squads will grow and become even more aggressive in their tactics, disappearing citizens and assaulting bystanders and witnesses.

The grift will continue. He’ll sell pardons to fraudsters and corrupt politicians, as long as they’re Republicans or politically pliable. The Trump Organization will see windfall profits as countries cut deals with the administration in exchange for enriching the Trump family and their associates. Republicans in Congress will continue to look the other way.

The economy will remain resilient, but prices will continue to increase, especially energy costs. “Affordability” will remain a catch phrase as people struggle to cover their costs even though unemployment stays relatively low.

Health care costs are going to increasingly dominate the political conversation. Premiums for people reliant on Obamacare are going to cause a lot of economic angst. My premium rose by almost 60%, costing me several thousands of dollars a year. Combined with looming cuts to Medicaid, health care costs are about to become a huge liability for Republicans.

Going into 2026, Republicans will suffer from the same economic problems that plagued Biden and the Democrats. The economy and jobs market will be relatively strong, but prices will leave voters feeling pinched. With control of the White House and Congress, the GOP will be at the receiving end of voters’ wrath this time.

Here in North Carolina, Republicans will suffer from the unpopularity of the Trump administration. Rising costs will leave voters in a foul mood. The legislature’s failure to pass a budget will leave rural communities that are disproportionately dependent on government jobs and money demoralized. They will feel the impact of teachers and state employees whose pay has stagnated as prices rise. Trickle down theory will take on a different meaning as the stores and businesses where they shop see their revenues drop, too.

With a dismal political environment for Republicans, 2026 will prove to be a good year for Democrats in North Carolina. Republican turnout will be down compared to 2022, the last midterm election. Anger at the Trump administration and dissatisfaction with the legislature will drive Democratic turnout higher than normal. Independent voters will break for Democrats.

The Republican primary for US Senate will expose the fighting playing out in the GOP right now. Much of MAGA will line up behind either Michele Morrow or one of the other Republicans running. Trump will come into the state to stump for Michael Whatley. He will prevail but the race will tighter than he wanted.

In the general election, Roy Cooper will maintain a significant lead throughout the year. The race will tighten in the fall but Whatley will never be able to catch the popular former governor. Whatley will be saddled with Trump’s unpopularity and the generally poor political environment. Cooper will win by six.

Senate President Pro-tem Phil Berger is going to lose his primary to Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. His loss will be a lesson about not knowing when to go. After his loss, Berger will resign his seat since trying to lead the Senate as a lame-duck would prove difficult with the jockeying among those who would succeed him. Berger and Thom Tillis, the two men who oversaw the 2010 GOP revolution in North Carolina, will exit the political stage at the same time.

In the legislature in general, Democrats will win enough seats in both chambers to sustain Governor Josh Stein’s veto, but will come up short of controlling either the state house or senate. It will give them more power to influence legislation than they have had in years. Stein will be more powerful heading into the second half of his term.

In the Supreme Court race, Justice Anita Earls will hold her seat, drafting off Cooper’s coattails and a favorable political environment for Democrats. The three Democrats running for Court of Appeals will also win.

Representative Don Davis will surprise people and win his seat despite the GOP gerrymandering. The political environment and Davis’ political savvy will pull him through.

In NC-11, Jamie Ager will give Chuck Edwards a fight. He’ll need a few breaks and a really good political environment to win, but Trump’s failures in western NC could be enough to get him over the top, especially if he can tie the lack of FEMA funds to Edwards’ lack of clout.

Republicans will face a tough election cycle in 2026. Donald Trump will remain unpopular. The GOP Congress will continue to be inept and ineffective. Prices on essential goods and services will continue to be high. GOP infighting will plague the party throughout the year, hampering turnout efforts and energy. Republicans will have little to motivate them to vote.

Democrats, for their part, need to beware of infighting. They need to avoid primaries that nominate candidates who do not fit districts or states. They should be reminded that Tea Party candidates in moderate states kept Republicans from controlling the US Senate until 2014 despite the wave in 2010.

This election is a referendum on the party in power. While Democrats should use the cycle to redefine themselves as more pragmatic, voters are thinking more about what the people in power have either offered them or done to them. It’s a largely reactionary election and Democrats should avoid making it about big ideas that they lack the power to carry out.

Let’s hope 2026 beats 2025.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7jql!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedcd00a3-fcee-4a76-b6b0-fe0e99ddc93a_390x308.jpeg",N,,2026-01-01 14:57:52.882339

Dear New Yorkers,

Today is the beginning of a new era in New York City — one with enormous opportunities ahead. Five years since the worst of COVID, our city has come roaring back in countless ways, reasserting ourselves as a global cultural and economic powerhouse. We have defied the skeptics yet again.

But amidst the prosperity of this city — with a soaring stock market and gleaming new office towers — far too many New Yorkers are struggling. The cost of housing is now increasingly beyond the reach of even middle class families. Young people are finding it more and more difficult to break into the job market. Our homelessness crisis has reached painful, unprecedented heights, fueled in part by a broken mental health system.

Our city’s budget, now at over $116 billion, is projected to face multi-billion dollar deficits in the years ahead, even before factoring in the significant economic uncertainty we are facing. Meanwhile, amidst all these challenges, many New Yorkers have lost faith in local government, and are facing a federal government which is more likely to be hostile than helpful. The pressures we face are real and growing.

The Office of the New York City Comptroller will have a pivotal role to play in meeting the challenges of this moment.

The Comptroller is our city’s chief financial officer, our pension fiduciary, and responsible for providing accountability to every agency of City government. The office is critical to the fiscal and economic health of the city at any time. And at moments of great challenges such as this it plays a truly outsized role.

I will make tackling our housing affordability crisis my top priority, in part by investing some of our pension funds — in a prudent way that gets strong returns for retirees — to finance the creation of affordable housing throughout the five boroughs.

I will work to create innovative financing mechanisms to dramatically expand our city’s green infrastructure, so that we win the race to carbon neutrality.

I will fight for a budget which invests in tenant legal services, so that our city at last lives up to the commitments in our first-in-the-nation right to counsel law for those facing eviction. I will push for more funding for in-patient psychiatric services, to help get New Yorkers who are suffering off the street into the care they need and deserve.

And I will use the tools of audit and oversight to ensure that our City government works better — for regular New Yorkers, for small business owners, and for tax-payers. This will in part require pushing City agencies to embrace the technology of the modern era, so that we have a government freed of the worst limitations of bureaucracy. It will require a City government which is nimble enough to move fast during a period of accelerating change, and to capitalize on the promises of new technology while protecting against its perils.

This is not a short to-do list. But I firmly believe we can achieve these things together, and that New York City can be a more affordable, fairer, safer and prosperous city for all. I look forward to working every day, as your new comptroller, to make that a reality.

The administration justified its decision by citing risks to national security. These risks were allegedly identified by the Department of War, but it is unclear exactly what dangers are involved.

The Minister of the Interior added a few details, stating that offshore wind farms create radar interference and pose a ""real threat to the US.""

It is quite telling that Denmark used the same argument last year to block the construction of new wind farms. There, they feared the impact of wind farms on military radars, which have become particularly important due to the escalating situation between the EU and Russia. However, experts then found that the structures could simply be adjusted and there would be no communication problems. And the US knows this.

This makes the grounds for the suspension appear more than contrived, especially given the lack of new information from officials.

“This silence speaks volumes, especially given the president’s long and well-documented opposition to offshore wind energy,” CNN quotes a joint statement from Virginia Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.

Criticism even from unlikely allies

Unexpectedly, this decision sparked criticism not only from proponents of clean energy, but also from representatives of the oil and gas industries. It turned out that these sectors had also invested significantly in offshore wind development.

“We urge the administration to end this pause and refrain from further actions that could harm jobs and investments,” said Erik Milito, President of the National Ocean Industries Association. “The U.S. needs a comprehensive energy strategy that covers all of the above, rather than a wholesale assault on renewable energy based on personal preference,” emphasized Liz Burdock, President and CEO of the Oceanic Network trade group.

Texas has emerged as a hotbed of green hydrogen activity in the US, supported in part by know-how borrowed from the oil and gas industry. Now another iconic fossil fuel state, Oklahoma, is jockeying for a piece of the action. A case in point is the Oklahoma City startup Tobe Energy, which has earned an investment from the home state fund Hurricane Ventures, along with a $1.8 million seed haul in September. So, what’s all the fuss about?

The Membrane-Free Green Hydrogen Solution

The main attraction is Tobe’s membrane-free electrolysis system for extracting hydrogen gas from water. Membrane-free is an atypical technology in the electrolysis circle, which is largely dependent on specialized membranes, so let’s take a brief look at the big picture.

Plain water could provide the hydrogen users of the world — of which there are many — with a more sustainable alternative to the standard method for procuring hydrogen, which involves squeezing it from natural gas or coal.

To date, investors and policy makers have focused on membrane-dependent electrolysis systems that push hydrogen gas from water with a catalyst and a jolt of electricity, ideally supplied by wind, solar, or other renewables. If that sounds costly, it is. A good deal of the expense comes from the membrane needed to keep the reaction moving (see more electrolysis background here).

Green hydrogen innovators around the world have been working on alternative membrane formulas and other system improvements to reduce the cost of electrolysis. Tobe is among the startups determined to skip to the head of the line by throwing out the membrane altogether, and starting from scratch (check out Tobe’s spec page here).

$1.8 Million For Membrane-Free Electrolysis

The University of Tulsa publicized the Hurricane Ventures commitment on December 26, noting that the two cofounders of Tobe Energy, Colby DeWeese and Caleb Lareau, are alumni of the school. “The funding will accelerate the company’s mission to make clean hydrogen production cheaper, more efficient and widely accessible to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy,” UT enthused.

“The company’s novel, membrane-free system simplifies the production process, cutting costs by up to 75% and reducing waste heat. This scalable technology is designed for large-scale use in industries like energy, manufacturing and transportation,” UT added. The transportation angle is somewhat at odds with the emerging consensus regarding the best-case economic scenarios for green hydrogen uptake. However, the manufacturing and energy use cases support a focus on on-site production for on-site or hyperlocal use, paring transportation and storage costs to the bone.

Hurricane Ventures also features in the $1.8 million round of seed funding spearheaded by Cortado Ventures in September. Cortado is keen on clean tech investing in the Mid-Continent region, which it defines as centered on Oklahoma and rippling into states at its borders including Texas as well as New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.

That may seem somewhat counterintuitive considering that red-state politics dominate the region. However, as amply demonstrated in Texas, vote-getting rhetoric can only do so much against the inevitable march of the decarbonization movement (here’s another example).

“These states are historically the Country’s centers for major legacy industries such as energy, aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture. As more startups innovate within these verticals, founders familiar with them are gaining an edge,” Cortado explains.

Pushing Down The Cost Of Green Hydrogen, With LEDs

CleanTechnica caught up with Tobe Energy briefly last September, so now would be a good time to dig in and see what Cortado and other seed participants see in the startup. Along with several to-be-named angel investors, the list includes the Scissortail and Hurricane branches of 46 VC, Techstars, and former SpaceX engineer Jamie Gull’s Wavefunction VC.

Cortado announced the close of the seed round on September 4, taking note of co-founder DeWeese’s experience in oil, gas, and petrochemical systems management. “Before launching Tobe, DeWeese served as principal process engineer at Hydrogen Technologies, where he led the design and delivery of the first zero-emission hydrogen boiler of its kind,” Cortado noted.

As described by Cortado, capital costs for the system run approximately 75% less than conventional electrolyzers. The news organization Journal Record also posted a long form article on the topic on November 5, offering additional details. As described by JR reporter Chip Minty, the Tobe electrolysis system deploys LEDs (light emitting diodes) as an energy-saver. “LEDs pass electricity through semiconductor chips that generate almost no heat and require at least 75% less energy to operate,” Minty notes.

“All of these other electrolysis companies have this resistant element that’s just like a filament,” DeWeese told JR. “We’re doing it just like an LED, so the secret sauce is a unique configuration, certain voltages, certain frequencies. It’s what causes the water to split.”

The LED angle on electrolysis is new to the CleanTechnica radar, but the idea of membrane-free electrolysis is not. That comes under the heading of photoelectrochemistry. When dunked in water and exposed to light, a PEC (photoelectrochemical cell) can churn out hydrogen gas. The technology, also nicknamed “artificial leaf” is designed to mimic photosynthesis as closely as possible, without relying on external sources of electricity (see more artificial leaf background here).

And, here’s where an interesting coincidence comes into play — or not, as the case may be. In its September 4 announcement, Cortado credits DeWeese’s father with the invention of “the TiVo.” If they mean the digital recording device firm TiVo, that company was founded by Mike Ramsay and Jim Barton in 1997. If you can figure out where a Mr. DeWeese factors in, drop a note in the comment thread.

TiVO4, on the other hand, has been surfacing around the green hydrogen field of late. TiVO4 — titanium vanadium (not vibranium!) oxide — is an emerging semiconductor material that can be applied to photoelectrochemical cells (here’s a recent example). After the holidays I’ll reach out to Tobe to see if any additional clarification is available.

In the meantime, let’s keep an eye on Oklahoma. As with Texas, Oklahoma has two factors going for it: an abundance of legacy expertise from the oil and gas industry, along with a strong and growing renewable energy profile. The state’s solar industry has lagged behind wind power and further obstacles are looming, but the state’s Department of Commerce is determined to make the renewable energy case for attracting new businesses to the state.

Although a long fracking-related earthquakes have dominated the news from Oklahoma, as of December the ODC website noted that Oklahoma is #3 in a 50-state ranking for total renewable energy capacity including solar, hydro, geothermal, and bio-diesel along in addition to wind power. Overall, renewables account for 47% of its electricity generation in the state, and the ODC emphasizes that businesses in search of 100% renewable energy can get that, too (see our Oklahoma archive here).

Partisan politics notwithstanding, it sure looks like Oklahoma is poised to play a significant role in the US energy transition. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tobe-energy-green-hydrogen.png,N,,2026-01-01 14:57:48.408426

December 22, 2025

Colorado River water could enable a pumped storage hydropower project intended to make the region’s electric grid more resilient.

KEY POINTS

One of the longest-duration pumped storage hydropower projects in the country is proposed for Navajo Nation land in the Four Corners region.

The project received a $7.1 million Department of Energy grant this year for feasibility studies.

Pumped storage hydropower is the largest form of energy storage in the U.S.

Standing in a breezy parking lot on Navajo land in the state’s far northwest corner, Tom Taylor looked toward the western horizon and then upwards at the furrowed mass of the Carrizo Mountains less than 10 miles away.

If all goes to plan, the infrastructure that could one day spill from the mountain’s flanks and through its core will become an essential piece of the region’s electric grid, able to store surplus electricity from renewable energy and other power sources for when it is needed later.

Fighting the wind that chilly November morning, Taylor used both hands to pin a detailed map against the hood of his Porsche Macan. A jumble of dashed lines and blue splotches representing proposed power lines, reservoirs, a water-supply pipeline, and access roads were printed atop the real-world geography on display in front of us.

“This will be a battery that lasts a long time,” Taylor said, holding tightly to the map.

The project is the $5 billion Carrizo Four Corners Pumped Storage Hydro Center, which is designed to be one of the largest long-duration energy storage projects in the country. Pumped storage moves water between two reservoirs at different elevations. Water is pumped uphill when excess electricity is available and released to generate electricity when power demand warrants it.

Taylor, a former mayor of Farmington and a state House representative from 2000 to 2014, is employed by Kinetic Power, the three-person, Santa Fe-based outfit behind the Carrizo proposal. The company sees the project as a way to make the region’s electric grid more durable and cost-effective, not only by smoothing the intermittent nature of wind and solar but also as a bulwark against energy emergencies like the winter storm in 2021 that caused blackouts and 246 deaths in Texas. The twinned reservoirs, using water sourced from a Colorado River tributary nearby, would have the capacity to generate 1,500 megawatts over 70 hours – a form of battery that could provide the equivalent output of a large nuclear plant for nearly three days.

“We believe that the key is delivering economic value,” said Thomas Conroy, Kinetic Power’s co-founder, who has four decades of experience developing energy projects.

What seems straightforward when placing lines on a map is much less so in three dimensions. Carrizo Four Corners, which is still in the exploratory stage and is at least five years away from breaking ground, has nearly as many questions as answers at this point. What is the geology within the Carrizo Mountains? Will it support a 3,300-foot-deep shaft, a subterranean powerhouse, and dam abutments? How will drought affect the water supply? What cultural sites and wildlife might be at risk from construction? What are the power market dynamics?

Answering those questions is the goal of a $7.1 million, two-and-a-half-year Department of Energy grant that Kinetic and its six university and research partners secured in August. (The state of New Mexico and the research partners are also contributing $7.1 million.) On the political side, will future Navajo administrations feel as favorably toward Carrizo as current president Buu Nygren?

The technical questions are but one piece of an ambitious project that touches many of the most pressing questions about natural resources in the American West today: energy development, water use, and the relationship between federal law and tribal law.

Connecting Water and Energy

Though the details are still to be worked out, the project can be described in broad strokes.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees federal hydropower licensing, granted Kinetic a preliminary permit in 2021. In February 2025 FERC extended the permit, which allows for site investigations but no construction work, for another four years.

The company envisions two “off-channel” reservoirs that would not dam a flowing river. The lower reservoir will be near Beclabito. The upper, in the high reaches of the Carrizo Mountains. Both are on Navajo land, but on different sides of the Arizona-New Mexico border.

The powerhouse that holds the electricity-generating turbines will be located underground, some 3,300 feet below the upper reservoir. Some of the longest pumped storage tunnels in the country will be required to connect the reservoirs and the powerhouse.

Despite the geotechnical challenges, Conroy is particularly enthused by the site, which he said is the most optimal in Arizona and New Mexico – and possibly the entire country – to locate a pumped storage hydropower project.

The site stands out for four reasons, he said. It is near existing transmission corridors and grid connections due to the region’s legacy of enormous coal-fired power plants. And it will have a comparatively low capital cost for the energy it will produce.

The other two reasons relate to water. Because of the extreme height differential between the upper and lower reservoirs – almost three Empire State Buildings – less water will be required to produce a unit of energy than for reservoirs with a gentler gradient. And because the upper reservoir site is a deep canyon, surface area and thus evaporation will be minimized.

“Water is just top of mind here in the Southwest,” Conroy said. “And our project is as water-efficient as can be made.”

Water to fill the reservoirs would be drawn from the San Juan River, a tributary of the Colorado, via pipeline. The water would come from the Navajo Nation’s San Juan rights, which have been quantified but are not fully used.

How much water? In its FERC permit application, Kinetic estimated that the initial fill, which will take one and a half to two years, would require 38,300 acre-feet. To cover subsequent evaporation losses, the reservoirs would need to be topped up with 2,635 acre-feet per year. Those numbers will be refined in the feasibility studies.

“It’s what, about 1,300 acres of corn?” Taylor said, doing a rough mental calculation of the equivalent water consumption for the annual evaporation loss. “I think this is more valuable than 1,300 acres of corn.”

Saving for Tomorrow

So far the project has threaded the federal government’s fraught energy politics. The Trump administration is hostile to wind and solar, which in their eyes reek of liberal values. Two water-based technologies – hydropower and geothermal – have escaped condemnation and are listed in the administration’s energy dominance documents. The DOE grant that Carrizo secured is a holdover from the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill, which provided up to $10 million for feasibility studies for pumped storage projects that would store renewable energy generated on tribal lands.

Storage is the holy grail of renewable energy. Human civilization has advanced, from the dawn of agriculture to the artificial intelligence revolution today, by being able to carry a surplus from one season and one year to the next. So it is with wind and solar. To maximize their utility and counteract their intermittent nature, engineers have been searching for cost-effective ways to store energy when the sun shines and when the wind blows for the days when neither of those things happen.

“If you want to improve the resiliency of the system, you either build more firm capacity instead of more renewable, or you build longer storage,” said Fengyu Wang, a New Mexico State University assistant professor who is the principal investigator for the DOE grant.

Storage has taken many forms. Some are fantastic mechanical configurations – lifting heavy objects and dropping them, or forcing air into caverns and releasing it. Thermal options use molten salt to trap the sun’s heat. The most familiar are batteries, which leverage chemical energy. But the most common, at least in the U.S., is pumped storage hydropower.

The 43 pumped storage facilities in the U.S. represent the bulk of the country’s utility-scale energy storage. They accounted for 88 percent of the total in 2024, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. That is changing quickly, however, as more battery storage comes online. The share for pumped storage was 96 percent in 2022.

Still, long-duration storage is where pumped storage shines. According to Oak Ridge, the median battery storage is two hours. For pumped storage, it is 12 hours. Longer duration provides more buffer, not only from day to day but also season to season.

In that regard, Carrizo would signify a huge leap. The only comparable pumped storage project under consideration in the U.S. is Cat Creek, in Idaho. Even though its duration is 121 hours, its generating capacity is less than half, at 720 megawatts.

Carrizo will have a different use case than other U.S. pumped storage projects, Conroy said. Many facilities have one customer and one generator. A nuclear plant, for instance, might be paired with a pumped storage system so that the nuclear plant can run continuously.

For Carrizo, there might be a consortium of utilities that have multiple generating sources feeding into this project and moving the water uphill. They would take delivery of that power across a large region with different climatic conditions and different needs for when and how they use the stored power. That means operating the facility will be more complicated than a traditional pumped storage project. One thing is certain, Conroy said: the Navajo will have an equity stake.

Tribal Outlook

Caution on the part of the Navajo would be understandable. The tribe’s lands have long been the center of energy developments with environmentally ruinous but economically helpful outcomes.

Uranium mining to fuel the Manhattan Project and then the nation’s reactors polluted rivers and groundwater, as did the coal mines that fed Four Corners Power Plant and the now-shuttered Navajo Generating Station and San Juan Generating Station. On the other hand, these developments provided employment and income. Navajo Mine, which supplies Four Corners Power Plant, accounts for about 35 percent of the Navajo Nation’s general fund.

Navajo and other tribal lands in the Four Corners region have been the target for a handful of pumped storage proposals in recent years. The Navajo Nation opposed three projects proposed for the Little Colorado River watershed, which were either withdrawn by the developer or denied a permit by FERC. Two other projects – Carrizo and Sweetwater, both using San Juan River water – are still in development. Sweetwater, a smaller project with eight hours duration, is being co-developed with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. A third project, Western Navajo Pumped Storage, which would be located near the former Navajo Generating Station, received a FERC preliminary permit in August.

Carrizo has not run into the same level of opposition as the other proposals. In part that is due to the proposed use of the San Juan River instead of groundwater, said Erika Pirotte, an assistant attorney general in the Navajo Nation’s water rights unit. Many Navajo communities rely on groundwater, and using it for pumped storage was viewed as unreasonable.

The lack of strong opposition is also because of Kinetic’s engagement with the Navajo Nation. The company has held meetings with the Beclabito, Red Valley, and Teec Nos Pos chapters, in addition to meetings with Navajo Nation agencies and Buu Nygren, the Navajo Nation president. Kinetic has a memorandum of understanding with Nygren, who also signed a letter of support for the project’s DOE grant application.

“We have the support of the council,” Conroy said. “We have a very high level of support from the president, and he is just extraordinarily interested in this project and seeing that it moves forward.”

From the Navajo perspective, what is interesting are the “ancillary benefits” that could come from the water supply pipeline, Pirotte said. Once the reservoirs are filled and the pipeline’s full capacity is not needed, the extra space could be repurposed for tribal water supply uses.

“That’s why the feasibility studies are really important for the Nation, because they help us understand to what extent Navajo Nation resources would be used for the project,” Pirotte said.

None of this is immediately around the corner, Conroy cautions. The DOE grant extends for more than two years. The FERC permitting process could be another two to four years. With Congress and the Trump administration talking about faster permitting and better coordination, that timeline is a best guess.

And then there is the question of tribal authority in the permitting process, not just for the Carrizo project but for other such developments. Will FERC abide by its 2024 stance that preliminary permits for hydropower projects on tribal lands require tribal consent? The Trump administration would like to see that policy scrapped. If FERC approves a project must a tribe assent to all the associated infrastructure? Will the Navajo be allowed to conduct reviews and issue permits?

And then there is construction, the biggest component. That will take four to six years, Conroy said.

Even on an ambitious timeline, Carrizo is not operating until the mid-2030s.

“I’m 77,” Taylor said. “I probably won’t see it.”

The future of the Indian energy sector will be driven forward by the unstoppable force of the solar power industry.","The surge of renewable energy has reached every corner of the world. From the United States to Australia, renewable energy production is on the rise. One nation that has seen a substantial increase in not only the use of solar power, but also the complicated manufacturing of the panels is India. The iconic Asian nation has for generations been subject to relying on imports of energy resources from the likes of China, which leads the world in solar power component manufacturing; however, with a June 2026 mandate in place, India’s solar manufacturing sector is on the rise.

India’s solar module manufacturing capacity reached new heights in 2025

India’s population is vast, so big in fact that the nation has unwittingly become one of the largest by population density in the world. And those billion or so people need electricity, not just for everyday life, but to drive economic expansion and propel the nation forward. This year, the Indian government has decided to implement a mandate requiring domestic energy projects that use solar power to source their components from local manufacturers.

Wood Mackenzie noted that in 2025, India was on track to surpass 125 GW of domestic solar component manufacturing, which would be approximately triple the domestic market demand of around 40 GW. This astonishing capacity surge is representative of India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which has catapulted the nation to compete with the bigger, more influential solar power manufacturing nations.

India may be faced with a challenge to align solar supply with domestic and international demand

While the surge in solar manufacturing is commendable, it may lead to a few challenges for the Indian solar market. The sector will need to contemplate the possibility of not being able to efficiently supply the domestic market due to overcapacity strangling the price for solar power, much like what has occurred in China recently, as noted by Wood Mackenzie.

“India’s government’s PLI scheme has been highly effective in spurring factory announcements, but the industry is now seeing warning signs of rapid overcapacity similar to those that preceded China’s recent price collapse. The challenge has shifted from building capacity to achieving cost-competitiveness and diversifying export markets.” – Yana Hryshko, Head of Solar Supply Chain Research at Wood Mackenzie

India’s Goldi Solar just secured a substantial investment in its solar portfolio

The Indian solar firm recently secured a $171 million investment from serious heavyweight backers, including Havells India, to boost solar power component manufacturing even further than the current levels. This significant investment is one of the largest made by a single company in India’s solar sector and exemplifies the surge of the sector in the nation.

The Indian government has outlined plans to increase non-fossil power generation from the current levels of 186 gigawatts to an astonishing 500 gigawatts. By June of this year, any public projects must source locally manufactured solar power components, marking a milestone in India’s renewable energy dream. With new entries into the global solar market becoming the norm, India is leading the solar-powered charge into the future.

India’s billion-dollar bet on its solar industry is producing results

India’s astonishing surge in solar manufacturing has been a sight for sore eyes in a nation that requires substantial amounts of energy just to keep the population at bay, which most of the time is a challenge on its own. With Rajasthan launching the nation’s first solar park integrated with battery storage, the sentiment over the renewable energy sector in India has never been clearer. The future of the Indian energy sector will be driven forward by the unstoppable force of the solar power industry.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Depositphotos_676327874_XL-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 17:57:29.799301

One of the project sponsor’s attorneys and authorized representatives, Matthew D. Norfolk, said he would “likely oppose” all of the green groups seeking to join the hearing.
The ALJ’s decision concerning party status, once rendered, can be appealed to the APA at a future meeting.
The green groups had both overlapping and unique reasons for seeking party status, as stated in their individual petitions.","While the public can watch the hearing, only those with party status can actively participate in it. This includes presenting evidence and testimony from experts, as well as cross-examining those of other parties. The four green groups — Adirondack Council, Adirondack Wild: Friends of the Forest Preserve, Protect the Adirondacks! and the Sierra Club’s Atlantic Chapter, which includes the entirety of New York state — are all opposed to the howitzer range. There are no other groups that filed petitions.

The only listed parties, so far, are those that had original status as parties of right: the Adirondack Park Agency, the project sponsor and the administrative law judge (ALJ) presiding over the hearing. The deadline to file intervenor petitions — where groups without original party status are subsequently granted it, provided they meet the relevant criteria — was Dec. 19.

State procedures that govern the APA’s adjudicatory law hearings require the hearing officer, ALJ David N. Greenwood, to make a decision approving or denying the petitions within five business days of the deadline, or ask for more information. In that case, the ruling would be within five business days of the deadline for that additional information.

On Monday, Greenwood wrote to the four green groups seeking party status, as well as the two other original parties, informing them that he would be asking for more information, stating that the applicable state regulations afford other parties “to be heard” as part of the consideration process for potentially granting prospective intervenors’ party status — and he wanted to allow time for that in advance of his ruling, especially given the current timing around the holidays.

One of the project sponsor’s attorneys and authorized representatives, Matthew D. Norfolk, said he would “likely oppose” all of the green groups seeking to join the hearing.

Greenwood asked the current and prospective parties to submit any comments or opposition to the petitions for party status by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 6. From there, he wrote that he hoped to issue rulings granting or denying the petitions five business days after that, or Tuesday, Jan. 13. It’s possible, though, that further delays could arise.

In granting a petition, Greenwood could limit the scope in which a certain party can participate. The ALJ’s decision concerning party status, once rendered, can be appealed to the APA at a future meeting.

The green groups had both overlapping and unique reasons for seeking party status, as stated in their individual petitions. The four groups all cited memberships that both reside in and visit the Adirondacks, and would be adversely impacted by the firing of a howitzer artillery cannon. They all point to demonstrated and extensive previous engagement with the APA on land use matters in the Adirondacks, including participation in the last adjudicatory hearing for the proposed Adirondack Club and Resort in Tupper Lake, held in 2011.

Adirondack Council

–

The Adirondack Council is represented by the Albany-based law firm Whiteman Osterman & Hanna LLP. One of its three attorneys on the case is Paul Van Cott, of Saranac Lake. He joined the firm in 2019 in an “of counsel” capacity after retiring as an APA attorney, having been with the agency for around 20 years.

In its petition, the Adirondack Council noted that the howitzer range proposal “is unprecedented in the history of the Adirondack Park,” and needs to be treated as such. The Adirondack Council cited 31 past examples of land use matters it has participated in as evidence of its ability to meaningfully and substantively engage in the proceeding.

“The proposed testing of military-grade weapons on the Project Site represents a use that is fundamentally different in character and intensity from activities traditionally permitted in the Adirondack Park, requiring careful expert planning and technical evaluation and analysis of the Applicant’s proposal,” the petition states.

Given how novel the proposal is, the petition further states that if it’s approved, it could set a precedent for similar projects throughout the park, including potential future expansions in weapons testing at the proposed site.

The Adirondack Council highlighted what it views as several deficiencies with the sound analysis that the project sponsor, Michael C. Hopmeier of Unconventional Concepts, Inc., presented as part of his application.

“The Applicant’s analysis relies on a(n approximately) 20-year-old Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) study, with unclear landscape and environmental conditions (temperature, vegetation, wind, ambient noise, humidity, device range) — factors that meaningfully affect sound propagation,” the petition states. “Despite these unknowns, the Applicant modeled source levels using a 130.5 dB measurement from the NDRE study to calculate a modeled source level of 180.8 dB for an M109 155 mm howitzer. However, source-to-receiver distances in the NDRE study differ from the (approximately) 675-foot distance between the proposed barrel assembly and target area here, undermining comparability.”

The Adirondack Council also pointed out that field measurements were taken in two days, one day apart, in late December, and if the testing were to take place in warmer months, as the proposal allows the option of, it could have a different noise dispersion effect.

The group also said the study has gaps in peak sound levels for the howitzer that warrant further independent review, and claimed that it failed to take into consideration the cumulative noise effects from a nearby mine, which, if the two sites were to be in operation simultaneously, the Adirondack Council said could have a greater negative ecological and human impact than what’s been modeled for.

The Adirondack Council’s petition did not name any specific witnesses, stating that it was still reviewing application materials and was in the process of identifying qualified experts for testimony.

–

Adirondack Wild: Friends of the Forest Preserve

–

Adirondack Wild dedicated much of its petition to contending that the proposed howitzer testing range, even though it’s on private land, is inconsistent with its zoning classification as “rural use.” The group noted that it submits monthly verbal public comments to the APA, and regularly submits written comments about new land use and development applications on rural-use land.

“Military-style testing of cannons exhibiting sound forces at or exceeding 100 dbA should not be deemed compatible with the stated legislated purposes, policies and objectives or Rural Use,” the petition states. “The (state) legislature was clear about this. Military-style weapons testing is not listed as either a primary or secondary use, meaning it is presumed incompatible in this land use classification.”

Adirondack Wild also took issue with the project being of commercial use, stating it appears to lack a military or commercial sponsor or purpose. It also raised concerns about nearby Forest Preserve land, which, at its closest point, is about 554 feet from the proposed range.

“The military-style testing will introduce new, potentially damaging noise forces within these public wildlands, thus directly affecting our environmental interests,” the petition states.

The petition did not, at this time, name any specific witnesses or evidence it would seek to introduce at the hearing.

–

Protect the Adirondacks!

–

Protect! detailed its history of participation in land use matters before the APA as a demonstration of its capability to meaningfully participate in the hearing, and stated that it would submit testimony on each of the three issues the adjudicatory hearing seeks to address: the project’s compatibility with the Adirondack Park, compatibility with rural use-zoned land and whether it would produce any undue adverse impacts on the resources of the Park.

Protect! included several witnesses in its petition, with the request that the list may be supplemented or modified as the hearing progresses, should the group be granted party status.

“Protect! intends to provide expert testimony regarding the history and characteristics of the Adirondack Park generally, why the proposed Project conflicts with the purposes and policies of the APA Act and whether the howitzer firing range is compatible with the purpose of insuring overall conservation, protection, preservation, development and use of the unique scenic, wildlife, recreational, open space, ecological and natural resources of the Adirondack Park,” the petition states.

Potential witnesses Protect! said it would call include Philip Terrie, Ph.D., one or more retired U.S. military personnel who Proect! said might focus on “alternatives to the proposed project” and former APA Associate Counsel Barbara Rottier, who Protect! said would testify on why the project is inconsistent with rural use-zoned land characteristics and commercial use issues.

Protect! also said it intends to call Kurt Fristrup, Ph.D., on how the proposed project’s noise could pose adverse ecological effects to nearby Forest Preserve land. The group also intends to present testimony from multiple witnesses in the town of Lewis regarding the “characteristics and community character of the area.”

In its petition, Protect! includes several other witnesses who would cumulatively testify on five of the eight sub-issues raised in the undue adverse environmental impact study.

–

Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter

–

The Sierra Club noted that it has 37,000 members in its Atlantic Chapter and, if granted party status, would be represented by Pace University’s Environmental Litigation Clinic. It pointed to the chapter’s past engagement with the APA’s land classification input, public hearings and public comment periods, specifically in relation to a state proposal to build a maximum security prison in Tupper Lake in the late 1990s, the Adirondack Club and Resort adjudicatory hearing, the land classification processes around Little Tupper Lake in Hamilton County and the Boreas Pond Tract in Essex County.

The petition states the Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter would present written testimony pertaining to whether its compatible with the rural use land classification and whether there would be an undue ecological impact or disruption to native or migrating wildlife and their habitats.

“The Sierra Club has both social and environmental interests which are likely to be affected by the agency decision concerning the project,” the petition states. “Sierra Club members who hike, hunt or birdwatch in the (area) will be deterred from doing so by the disruption of solitude caused by the howitzer blasts, and the disruption of opportunities to observe wildlife caused by the howitzer blast and by the potential decline in wild bird populations and breeding disruption caused by the howitzer blasts.”

Paws need claws: Declawing a cat in California is now illegal unless the surgery is medically necessary.","Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office this week described 2025 as “the year that would not end.” But it has, and in its aftermath comes a slew of new laws passed that year that will affect the lives of almost every Californian.

The governor signed nearly 800 bills last year, including legislation that caps the cost of insulin, streamlines California State University admissions and temporarily allows sexual assault claims that are past the statute of limitations. He also approved legislation banning law enforcement officers from wearing masks to hide their identities during operations — a law that’s already being challenged in court by the Trump administration.

Some of the new state laws were passed years ago and are just now taking effect.

“These new laws reflect who we are: a state that protects workers, respects students, puts people before politics, and isn’t afraid to hold powerful interests accountable,” Newsom said in a Tuesday statement.

Most of the laws listed below take effect on New Year’s Day. As in years past, the list mostly reflects the interests of the Democrats who hold a supermajority in both the state Senate and Assembly and hold every statewide office in California, including the governorship.

Here are a few notable laws going into effect:

Health

Fertility treatments: Large employer health plans will be required to cover infertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization, for everyone, regardless of marital status, gender identity or sexual orientation. “California is a proud reproductive freedom state — and that includes increasing access to fertility services that help those who want to start a family,” Newsom said after signing the bill in 2024. The governor later pushed to delay implementation of state Senate Bill 729 until 2026. IVF costs Californians an average of $24,000 out of pocket, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Cheaper insulin: Large group health plans must cap the out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 for a 30-day supply under SB 40. Roughly 3.5 million adults have diagnosed diabetes in California, according to the American Diabetes Assn. “Many Americans with diabetes have made the difficult decision to ration this lifesaving medication to pay for other necessities, such as groceries or rent,” said Christine Fallabel, the association’s state government affairs director, in a news release. “This legislation will provide much-needed financial relief.” California will also start selling $11 insulin pens through the state’s prescription program, CalRx, on Jan. 1.

Privacy for providers: Healthcare providers and employees affiliated with gender-affirming services can have their residential addresses withheld from certain public record requests. Assembly Bill 82 allows these providers to submit applications for increased privacy to the California secretary of state if they are experiencing harassment or violent threats due to the nature of their work. California already allows those working in reproductive healthcare to apply.

Protection for immigrants: Healthcare officials are prohibited from disclosing a patient’s immigration status or birthplace and from giving immigration authorities access to nonpublic spaces in hospitals and clinics without a search warrant or court order. The protections under SB 81 are among new laws to protect immigrants in California, Newsom said, from the “secret police” of President Trump and Stephen Miller, the White House advisor who has driven the second Trump administration’s surge of immigration enforcement in Democratic-led cities.

Law enforcement and legal rights

Mask ban: Law enforcement officers must visibly display their name or badge number during operations and are also banned from wearing masks that conceal their identities while on duty, with some exceptions. SB 805 and SB 627 were introduced in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration raids in Southern California, which in many cases were conducted by masked agents in unmarked cars. Newsom has said it’s unacceptable for “secret police” to grab people off the streets. The U.S. Department of Justice is suing California over the new laws, arguing both are unconstitutional and could put officers in danger.

Sexual assault reporting: A two-year window is opening to report sexual assault claims — cases that previously would have been barred because of the statute of limitations — against private employers or institutions that engaged in a “cover-up.” The time frame starts Jan. 1 and expires Dec. 31, 2027. AB 250 applies to those who were assaulted after age 18. The state already created an extension for child sexual assault victims in 2020. “AB 250 gives those who’ve been silenced by intimidation, shame, or institutional cover-ups another shot at justice, because survivors deserve to be heard, believed, and supported,” Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia M. Aguiar-Curry (D-Winters) said in October.

Amicable divorce: California couples seeking an amicable dissolution of their marriage will now have an easier, less costly way to go their separate ways. Under SB 1427, which passed in 2024, couples will be allowed to file a joint petition for dissolution of their marriage or legal separation. Until now, filing a joint petition was permitted only in limited circumstances, including when the couple had been married for fewer than five years and where their community property assets were worth less than $25,000. In all other cases, the couple had to navigate a more onerous legal process.

Consumer protections and laws

Buh-bye plastic bags: Plastic bags at grocery store checkout stands are banned under a law that was passed in 2024. Stores can offer recycled paper bags or customers can bring in their own bags. The change under SB 1053 comes almost a decade after California voters passed a statewide ballot measure that banned single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts. At many stores, those were replaced with thicker plastic carryout bags that were considered reusable and could be recycled. But in reality, many customers used them just once and tossed them.

Food delivery: Food delivery services including Uber Eats, DoorDash and Postmates will be required to provide a full refund to customers if their order is not delivered, or if the wrong order is delivered. Under AB 578, food delivery services also must provide customer service support, staffed by actual people, to help resolve requests for refunds.

Rental car estimates: Rental car companies will be required to provide customers with a good-faith estimate of the total charges, including taxes and fees, when providing a price quote for a reservation. Under AB 1374, the companies also must disclose whether the vehicles are gas-powered or electric or use another fuel source.

Volume control: Video streaming services under SB 576 will be prohibited from airing advertisements that are louder than the shows or other video content they are providing. Federal law already bans that practice on broadcast stations and cable channels.

Overdraft fees: State-chartered credit unions are prohibited from charging overdraft fees exceeding $14 or the amount set by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whichever is lower. SB 1075 was passed and signed into law in 2024.

Business, workers and technology

Minimum wage increase: The state minimum wage increases from $16.50 to $16.90 on Jan. 1. Some counties and cities, including Los Angeles, already have higher local minimum wage requirements. Workers paid less than minimum wage can file a wage theft claim with the California labor commissioner’s office. The state’s labor laws apply to workers regardless of immigration status.

New state holiday: Diwali, also known as the “Festival of Lights,” has been added to California’s official list of statewide holidays. This means public schools can close and state employees can elect to take the day off. Diwali typically occurs in late October or early November and is celebrated by members of the Hindu, Sikh and Jain faiths. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness. AB 268 makes California the third state to recognize the holiday, following Pennsylvania and Connecticut.

Deleting social media: Major social media platforms are required to provide users with a button in the account settings that allows them to delete their account — and make that button accessible on any format used to access the platform, including cellphones, computers and tablets. AB 656, passed in 2025, also requires social media platforms to delete the personal information in a user’s account when they cancel.

Protecting kids from AI: Artificial intelligence companies are required to notify users younger than 18 at least every three hours to take a break and that the chatbot is not human. They are also required to implement “reasonable measures” to prevent companion chatbots from generating sexually explicit content. SB 243 was enacted to prevent the production of suicide or self-harm content and put in protections, such as referring users to a suicide hotline or crisis text line.

AI and public safety: Large artificial intelligence companies will be required to publicly disclose their security protocols and reports of critical safety incidents. SB 53 will require companies to disclose their safety and security protocols and risk evaluations. It mandates reporting of critical incidents — such as cyberattacks or unsafe behavior by autonomous AI systems — to the state’s Office of Emergency Services. Violations of the new law can bring civil penalties of up to $1 million against companies.

Less red tape for restaurants: The approval process for independent restaurants that want to retrofit spaces is being streamlined under AB 671. “For too long, opening a restaurant in California has meant endless hurdles and frustrating delays,” said the bill’s author, Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), in October. “We’re making it easier for small restaurateurs to turn their ideas into reality.”

Lyft and Uber drivers can unionize: Hundreds of thousands of ride-hail drivers can unionize and bargain collectively while still being classified as independent contractors. Wicks, who co-authored AB 1340 with Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), previously said this will allow drivers to ”bargain for better pay and protections, and help build a future where the gig economy works for the people behind the wheel.” The law was a compromise between labor groups and Silicon Valley gig economy companies.

More oil: Oil production can ramp up in Central California. SB 237 will allow up to 2,000 new wells annually in Kern County, effective through 2036. The law, which drew ire from environmentalists, is intended to prevent a spike in gas prices amid refinery closures.

Education

Direct admissions: Public high school students who meet the California State University’s minimum eligibility requirements will be automatically admitted and able to enroll at one of 16 CSU campuses. SB 640 is intended to encourage students who are unsure about college to attend. “Being able to get that message that says, ‘Hey, you’re admitted, and you just need to submit some paperwork,’ I think it’s going to be a big boost for a lot of students,” Adrian Huerta, an associate professor and college access scholar at the USC Rossier School of Education, has said.

Gender-neutral bathrooms: All public schools in California will be required to provide at least one all-gender bathroom starting July 1. The legislation expands a decade-old law that requires K-12 schools to allow students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. SB 760 was passed in 2023. “These measures will help protect vulnerable youth, promote acceptance and create more supportive environments in our schools and communities,” Newsom said in a statement when he signed the bill.

Cellphones in classrooms: Public schools are required to adopt a policy by July 1 to prohibit or limit the use of smartphones by students when they are on campus. AB 3216 leaves it up to local K-12 schools whether students should be banned from using cellphones altogether. But the law requires public schools to restrict phone use in order to “support pupil learning and well-being.”

Immigration raids: Federal immigration agents are barred from nonpublic areas of public schools unless they have a judicial warrant or court order. Under AB 49, school districts also are prohibited from providing information about pupils, their families, teachers and school employees to immigration authorities without a warrant. SB 98 also requires school administrators to notify families and students if federal agents conduct immigration operations on a K-12 or college campus.

Antisemitism: A state Office for Civil Rights will be created to combat antisemitism and other forms of discrimination in California schools. AB 715 was among the most hotly contested education-related measures, spawning from dissatisfaction, largely among a coalition of Jewish groups, with the way ethnic studies have been taught in some California classrooms. On Wednesday, a federal judge in San José rejected a lawsuit filed by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee on behalf of a group of educators and students, who challenged the law, clearing AB 715 to take effect.

Animals

Official snake: The giant garter snake is recognized as the official snake of California. Advocates hope this recognition from SB 765 will raise awareness about the threatened species, which is found in the Central Valley and has experienced large-scale habitat destruction due to urban and agricultural development.

Paws need claws: Declawing a cat in California is now illegal unless the surgery is medically necessary. AB 867 bans the procedure, which entails amputating the first bone in each of a feline’s toes or severing the tendons. Assemblymember Alex Lee (D-San José), the bill’s author, previously called the practice “barbaric” and inhumane.

Housing

Faster construction: Various infrastructure projects are now exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act’s lengthy review process. This reversal from AB 130 and SB 131 has outraged environmentalists, who say it removes crucial protections for the state’s most vulnerable wildlife and communities. Proponents of the legislation argue construction must be faster and cheaper to address the state’s housing crisis.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa1a592/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2878x1511+0+745/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2Fdc%2F19c5c410422cb9e78a61e8ad9a12%2Fnew-laws-in-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 12:57:47.113113
,North Carolina American Energy ,2026-01-01 16:56:23+00:00,markets.financialcontent.com,The Functional Frontier: How Celsius Holdings Redefined the Energy Market in 2025,Not Available,,,,,https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/marketminute-2026-1-1-the-functional-frontier-how-celsius-holdings-redefined-the-energy-market-in-2025,"By the close of 2025, Celsius and its newly integrated brands commanded nearly 17% of the U.S. energy drink market, solidifying its position as the undisputed third-largest player in the category.
By the third quarter of 2025, Celsius reported a 55% year-over-year revenue increase, with the stock price recovering over 110% from its 2024 lows to trade in the $46–$48 range.
Throughout 2025, Celsius successfully executed rollouts in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia.
By the end of 2025, international revenue reached an annualized run rate of $100 million, proving that the brand's ""functional"" appeal transcends North American borders.
While still the volume leaders, both lost market share in 2025 as consumers traded ""extreme"" energy for the ""clean"" energy marketed by Celsius and Alani Nu.","As of January 1, 2026, the energy drink landscape has undergone a seismic shift, moving away from the high-octane, extreme-sports branding of the early 2000s toward a ""Better-For-You"" (BFY) functional era. At the center of this transformation is Celsius Holdings (Nasdaq: CELH), which has officially transitioned from a high-growth disruptor into a diversified beverage titan. After a turbulent 2024 marked by inventory corrections and a cooling U.S. consumer market, Celsius spent 2025 orchestrating one of the most successful strategic pivots in the industry, punctuated by the landmark acquisition of Alani Nu.

The implications for the broader market are profound. Celsius, alongside its distribution partner PepsiCo (Nasdaq: PEP), has successfully bridged the gap between fitness enthusiasts and everyday consumers. By the close of 2025, Celsius and its newly integrated brands commanded nearly 17% of the U.S. energy drink market, solidifying its position as the undisputed third-largest player in the category. For investors and competitors alike, the ""Celsius Playbook"" has become the new standard for scaling a lifestyle brand in an increasingly health-conscious world.

From Volatility to Dominance: The 2024-2025 Turnaround

The journey to the top was far from linear. In mid-2024, Celsius faced its first major crisis of confidence since its meteoric rise. Shares of Celsius Holdings (Nasdaq: CELH), which had peaked near $100 in early 2024, plummeted to the mid-$20s by the end of that year. The primary catalyst was a massive ""destocking"" event by PepsiCo, which reduced its inventory of Celsius products by over $100 million to optimize working capital. This created a significant timing mismatch, where the company reported lackluster shipment growth even as retail sales velocity remained high.

However, 2025 served as a year of aggressive redemption. In April 2025, Celsius announced the $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu, a brand that had built a cult-like following among female consumers and the fitness community. This move did more than just add volume; it diversified Celsius’s demographic reach and provided a buffer against the slowing growth of its core product line. By the third quarter of 2025, Celsius reported a 55% year-over-year revenue increase, with the stock price recovering over 110% from its 2024 lows to trade in the $46–$48 range.

The international front also provided a significant tailwind. Throughout 2025, Celsius successfully executed rollouts in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia. In the UK, a partnership with Suntory Beverage & Food (TYO: 2587) placed Celsius on the shelves of major retailers like Morrisons, while in France, the brand achieved 88% grocery penetration through deals with Carrefour and E.Leclerc. By the end of 2025, international revenue reached an annualized run rate of $100 million, proving that the brand's ""functional"" appeal transcends North American borders.

Winners and Losers in the New Energy Order

The rise of functional beverages has created a clear divide in the market. The primary winners are those who have leaned into the ""lifestyle"" segment. Keurig Dr Pepper (Nasdaq: KDP) emerged as a formidable challenger by taking a majority stake in Ghost Energy in late 2024. Throughout 2025, Ghost saw growth rates exceeding 20%, leveraging authentic collaborations with brands like Warheads and Sour Patch Kids to dominate the gaming and Gen Z demographics. Similarly, ZOA Energy, backed by Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP), successfully pivoted toward an ""everyday electrolyte"" focus, seeing double-digit sales growth in late 2025.

Conversely, the year 2025 was a period of reckoning for ""hype-driven"" brands. Prime Energy, the influencer-led brand by Logan Paul and KSI, suffered a dramatic collapse, with sales falling as much as 70% in certain regions. The brand was plagued by litigation, including a $68 million supplier lawsuit and regulatory scrutiny over its caffeine content. The legacy giants, Monster Beverage Corp (Nasdaq: MNST) and Red Bull, also faced headwinds. While still the volume leaders, both lost market share in 2025 as consumers traded ""extreme"" energy for the ""clean"" energy marketed by Celsius and Alani Nu. Monster, in particular, struggled to find significant traction with its alcohol-infused ""Beast Unleashed"" line, which failed to offset the slowing growth of its core energy portfolio.

The Regulatory Squeeze and the Functional Pivot

The wider significance of Celsius’s performance lies in its alignment with broader industry trends and shifting regulatory landscapes. As 2025 drew to a close, the energy drink sector faced unprecedented pressure from global health authorities. In the UK, the government moved to ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children under 16, a move that forced many brands to reformulate or lose significant convenience store access. In the U.S., the introduction of the ""Caffeine Safety Bill"" (H.R. 2511) in late 2025 signaled a new era of transparency, requiring warning labels for products exceeding 150mg of caffeine per serving.

Celsius has navigated these waters more effectively than its peers by positioning itself as a ""fitness partner"" rather than a ""stimulant."" The company’s focus on thermogenic properties and sugar-free formulas has insulated it from some of the harshest criticisms leveled at ""sugar-bomb"" energy drinks. This shift reflects a broader consumer move toward ""proactive health,"" where every calorie and milligram of caffeine is scrutinized for its functional benefit. The success of Celsius has effectively forced the entire industry to reconsider its marketing tactics, moving away from youth-centric ""hype"" and toward adult-oriented ""utility.""

The Road Ahead: Integration and International Scale

Looking toward the remainder of 2026, the primary challenge for Celsius will be the full integration of Alani Nu and the management of its increasingly complex global supply chain. While the acquisition has provided a massive boost to market share, maintaining the distinct ""voice"" of both brands under one corporate umbrella will require delicate brand management. Investors will be watching closely to see if Celsius can maintain its industry-leading gross margins, which stabilized near 51.5% in late 2025, in the face of fluctuating commodity costs and international shipping pressures.

Short-term opportunities lie in the potential for further international expansion into Asian markets, where the functional beverage category is still in its infancy. However, the brand must also prepare for potential strategic pivots if U.S. regulatory pressure on caffeine intensifies. We may see Celsius experiment more heavily with non-caffeinated ""recovery"" drinks or broaden its reach into the functional water category to future-proof its portfolio against further stimulant-related legislation.

A New Era for Beverage Investors

The story of Celsius Holdings over the past two years is a masterclass in market resilience. From the ""Great Reset"" of 2024 to the ""Alani Nu Rebound"" of 2025, the company has proven that consumer demand for functional, better-for-you beverages is not a fad, but a fundamental shift in the American diet. As we enter 2026, Celsius is no longer the underdog; it is a pillar of the beverage sector, commanding a combined market share that rivals the legacy giants of the past.

For investors, the coming months will be defined by two key metrics: international margin expansion and the resolution of the U.S. regulatory environment. While the era of triple-digit growth may be over, the era of sustainable, diversified profitability appears to have just begun. The energy drink market is no longer just about the ""buzz""—it’s about the ""benefit,"" and for now, Celsius is the brand that has best captured that zeitgeist.

How operators can reduce local impacts Data centers can address common community concerns by following best practices, Asare said.
Data center operators need to invest in sustainable design to mitigate environmental issues and avoid placing hyperscale data centers down on undeveloped sites, Nikolopoulos said.
Data centers also can be designed to minimize the disruption to wildlife, which Scandinavian data centers have done in both fjord and forest environments, Nikolopoulos said.
Size and location are key to ensuring data centers do not impose on birds, deer or other native species.","Data center projects have been flooding into Northwest Indiana, often raising concerns from residents who would have to live with them for years to come.

Advocates of data centers say they can be designed to minimize impact, such as by using renewable energy or closed-loop cooling systems that return water to its source.

Academics say communities can take steps to ensure data centers are as sustainable and low-impact as possible, typically by putting requirements in place during the planning and permitting process. When hyperscale data centers come to town, cities and towns can negotiate community benefit agreements that can bring some improvements such as upgrades to the electrical grid, investments in the local workforce and STEM funding in schools, Indiana University Cybersecurity Clinic Executive Director Isak Nti Asare said.

""Local governments have a substantial amount of leverage,"" Asare said. ""They are well aware of what people want and the concerns people have about data centers. Design choices can determine what sort of impact data centers have. Broad things like a cooler climate, lower water stress, strong grid capacity, the protection of sensitive habitat and stormwater can be handled in the design and the deal.""

Experts say there are ways data centers can have a lower impact than many assume, such as by locating on already developed land, using high-efficiency servers, taking advantage of the existing grid, operating at high utilization, reusing waste heat and minimizing water use through closed-loop or air-based cooling, Virginia Tech John W. Hancock Professor of Engineering Dimitrios Nikolopoulos said. They can, for instance, use renewable energy, which some large tech players like Microsoft and Google have pledged to do.

""There’s a wide range in how much data centers rely on renewables. Some big players, like Google and Microsoft, sign long-term power-purchase agreements and aim for 24/7 carbon-free energy, while many other operators still largely depend on conventional grids and renewable energy credits,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Even '100% renewable' claims usually refer to annual accounting, not real-time clean power. I think we should aim higher: match workloads with local renewables in real time where possible, add on-site solar or storage when it makes sense, and design centers to shift some AI workloads to follow the sun and wind.""

Energy demand is soaring

Data centers use a lot of energy, said University of Chicago professor of computer science Andrew A. Chien. Data centers consumed about 280 terawatt-hours of electricity, or an average of roughly 32 gigawatts of power, over the course of a year.

""This number is growing fast and expected to exceed 80 gigawatts by 2028,"" he said.

By 2028, data centers will consume 8% of all electricity generated in the United States, Chien said. They already account for a major fraction of total grid power in dense data center areas like Northern Virginia, where data centers consume 30% of the power today and are expected to exceed 50% by the mid-2030s. Data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity in Ireland and are projected to use more than 30% of power on the Emerald Isle before 2030.

Data centers are inherently power-guzzling and are not going to reduce energy consumption, Chien said.

""This is not going to happen. Their growth is rapid,"" he said. ""They make significant money on every MWh they consume for cloud and AI, so there is no real economic incentive for them to reduce their growth.""

Data centers, however, can reduce their carbon footprint through measures like energy efficiency, longer equipment lifetimes and the use of low-carbon footprint materials, Chien said. The biggest thing that can be done to make them more sustainable is avoid evaporative cooling to keep water consumption to a minimum.

""Beyond that they should be flexible power grid loads — this reduces the amount of pressure they put on the grid,"" he said. ""That pressure causes much more generation plants and transmission to be built, which is bad for sustainability and it's also not what data centers want, as the pressure slows down approval of their connection to the grid.""

Where data centers are built matters

Data centers can also be located to minimize impact, such as in areas already zoned for industrial use, Nikolopoulos said.

Ideally, they would be located in industrial and commercial areas with strong electric grid connections, good access to clean energy and low-flood and climate risk.

""Locations in cooler climates with access to hydro or wind — like Luleå, Sweden, or parts of Norway—show how siting can dramatically reduce both cooling energy use and the carbon footprint,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Ideally, they’re also close to where people and businesses actually use data — cities, campuses, transport hubs — so we’re not hauling everything to far-off mega-hubs. I’m particularly fond of reusing old industrial lots, brownfields or even parking structures for modular data centers that blend into what’s already there.""

Air cooling of the computer servers in data centers is possible in colder climates, cutting down on water usage, Asare said. But water can absorb heat, making data centers more energy-efficient so there's a trade-off, he said.

With thoughtful planning, data centers can be sustainable, Nikolopoulos said. Developers need to consider the entire life cycle of data centers, including construction materials, energy mix, water use, hardware refresh and eventual decommissioning, Nikolopoulos said.

""That means high utilization, reuse, and recycling of hardware, and architectures that deliver more compute per watt and per cubic meter — essentially miniaturizing the data center,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""It also means being a good long-term neighbor: sharing waste heat, supporting public services, and being transparent about environmental performance. To me, a sustainable data center isn’t just efficient; it’s built to play the long game with its community.""

How operators can reduce local impacts

Data centers can address common community concerns by following best practices, Asare said. Some options include using a closed-loop system to avoid wasting water or immersion cooling to prevent the discharge of heated water that could disturb aquatic life.

""From my perspective, the future of AI servers is underwater or in some type of fluid with no waste of water,"" he said.

The use of renewable energy to power data centers rather than relying solely on renewable energy matching would minimize the carbon footprint, Nikolopoulos said.

Data center operators need to invest in sustainable design to mitigate environmental issues and avoid placing hyperscale data centers down on undeveloped sites, Nikolopoulos said. He believes the data centers should shift away from mega-campuses to networks of smaller sites with impacts that are easier to monitor and manage.

""They can mitigate impacts by investing heavily in efficiency, clean power and low-water cooling; by avoiding water-intensive designs in drought-prone regions; and by building on already disturbed land rather than carving up new greenfields,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Many operators are now publishing detailed energy and water metrics and setting targets for power-usage effectiveness and water-usage effectiveness, which is a good start.""

Data centers can take advantage of cold weather to limit cooling needs, use air cooling to minimize water use and capture and recycle heat, such as by using it to heat homes, Asare said.

Lower-impact data centers have been built around the world, including in Scandinavia, Nikolopoulos said. They use high shares of renewable power and seawater or fjord water for cooling.

""Google’s Hamina facility in Finland operates in a converted paper mill, uses seawater cooling from the Bay of Finland, and is now feeding recovered heat into the local district heating network,"" he said. ""In Norway, Lefdal Mine Datacenter runs in a former mine with cold fjord-water cooling and 100% renewable electricity, and Green Mountain’s DC1-Stavanger reuses waste heat to support land-based lobster and trout farming. I see these as early prototypes for a broader shift toward smaller, integrated, community-serving data centers that minimize land, water and carbon footprints rather than giant, stand-alone campuses.""

Environmental concerns must be built in early

Environmental concerns need to be addressed from the start in the design process, such as how data centers are cooled, Nikolopoulos said. Energy, water, noise and heat should be integrated into the design rather than treated as afterthoughts.

""In practice, that points to high-efficiency direct-to-chip liquid or immersion cooling, sometimes paired with free cooling from outside air where the climate allows, and designed from day one to capture and reuse waste heat—for example, feeding it into district heating or industrial processes,"" he said. ""I’d love to see the industry ditch huge, water-guzzling evaporative towers in hot, dry places and move toward smaller, closed-loop systems that pack more computing into less space, with less waste.""

Closed-loop water systems are more expensive but are considered a best practice, Asare said.

""Local governments need to ask about cooling during the permitting process,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be an afterthought. Local governments need to start to think about these things before they give approvals.""

Data centers also can be designed to minimize the disruption to wildlife, which Scandinavian data centers have done in both fjord and forest environments, Nikolopoulos said. Size and location are key to ensuring data centers do not impose on birds, deer or other native species.

""Data centers can avoid harming wildlife by skipping critical habitats and migration paths, using dark-sky-friendly lighting, and ensuring that noise and heat don’t leak into nearby natural areas,"" he said. ""Planting native vegetation and maintaining buffer zones around the site help. Once again, putting smaller centers on land that’s already developed is far gentler than bulldozing untouched greenfields for a giant campus.""

The Saskatchewan Low-Income Tax Credit, which is designed to help the province’s lowest earners, will go up by five per cent for the year as part of a four-year enhancement plan.
The government said these tax credits are “aimed at helping with affordability and are also increasing, including the Low Income Tax Credit, the Disability Tax Credit and supplement, the Caregiver Tax Credit, Personal Care Home Benefit, Active Families Benefit, First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit and the Graduate Retention Program.” “We recognize that rising costs are challenging, and we remain committed to providing affordability relief for residents,” Jim Reiter, Saskatchewan’s finance minister, said in a statement.","As the calendar flips over to 2026, the Government of Saskatchewan says a number of legislative and tax changes are expected to keep more money in the pockets of residents, especially the lowest earners.

The new year will bring some changes in legislation around the Employment Act and The Saskatchewan Affordability Act, according to the provincial government.

Some of the changes to the Employment Act include:

letting employers use a calendar day rather than 24 consecutive hours to schedule work and overtime hours;

forbidding employers from keeping tips from their employees;

increasing the limit for when employers must notify employees, the minister and any unions of a group termination from 10 employees to 25 employees;

restricting when employers can ask for sick notes;

giving the director of employment standards the authority to order reinstatement and compensation for lost wages in cases of when an employer conducts discriminatory action; and

lengthening various leave arrangements.

The duration of long-term sick leave has also been extended from 12 to 27 weeks, which the ministry said aligns with federal insurance benefits and provides additional job protection to employees who are receiving benefits.

Additionally, maternity leave is being extended to employees who experience a loss of pregnancy “up to 20 weeks before the estimated due date.”

Employees experiencing interpersonal violence are now offered 16 weeks of unpaid leave, in addition to the existing 10 day leave (five days paid and five unpaid).

Bereavement leave has also been extended “to allow the leave within six months of a death rather than a week before or after the funeral, permitting leave for the death of a person the employee considers to be ‘like’ family and for the loss of a pregnancy of an employee or an employee’s immediate family.”

Another change means part-time employees “can participate in modified work arrangements where overtime is paid after the working hours established in the work schedule as opposed to the existing eight hours in a day.”

Employers in the retail sector will no longer be required to give workers two consecutive days off each week, which the ministry said brings retail into line with other sectors, “which must provide one day off.”

Additionally, the amendments mean that employers with non-unionized employees can apply to the director of employment standards “for a variance from the meal break and notice of work schedule change provisions, with the written consent of the employees.” Unions can also negotiate variances from the provisions directly with the employer without needing to go to the director for approval.

Other changes include “clarifying that employees can be paid their wages in cash,” and a further clarification saying employers do not have to provide vacation pay on the period where pay-in-lieu of notice is being provided.

Complete details of the changes can be found on the Government of Saskatchewan’s website.

Income tax changes

Some Saskatchewan residents could see some increases in their tax credit amounts due to The Saskatchewan Affordability Act and annual inflation indexing, which adjusts taxation rates in accordance with inflation in order to avoid driving people into higher tax brackets, according to the Government of Saskatchewan.

This increase in tax credits is part of a four-year income tax reduction plan which the government touts as the “highest tax-free income tax threshold in Canada.”

The government also income tax changes in 2026 will “provide Saskatchewan residents $42 million in tax savings in the coming year that would have occurred as a result of inflation.”

“This preserves the real value of the amount all taxpayers can earn without paying tax, particularly benefiting those on fixed incomes,” the government added.

The amount individuals can earn before taxes are applied will go up to $20,381 for 2026 from $19,491 in 2025. The government said this increase is part of the plan to add $500 each year to that amount and other personal credits through to 2028, plus inflation adjustments.

Other personal tax credits, including spousal, dependent child and senior supplementary amounts, will also see the same $500 raise, in addition to indexation for the 2026 tax year, as the Sask. Party promised during the recent provincial election campaign.

The Saskatchewan Low-Income Tax Credit, which is designed to help the province’s lowest earners, will go up by five per cent for the year as part of a four-year enhancement plan.

Federal income tax brackets and the level of income a person can earn before taxes are applied by Ottawa are also indexed to inflation (two per cent for 2026) and the lowest federal tax rate drops to 14 per cent in 2026, the province noted in a statement.

The government said these tax credits are “aimed at helping with affordability and are also increasing, including the Low Income Tax Credit, the Disability Tax Credit and supplement, the Caregiver Tax Credit, Personal Care Home Benefit, Active Families Benefit, First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit and the Graduate Retention Program.”

“We recognize that rising costs are challenging, and we remain committed to providing affordability relief for residents,” Jim Reiter, Saskatchewan’s finance minister, said in a statement.

“Annual indexation, combined with the income tax measures in this year’s budget, help to keep Saskatchewan among the most affordable places to live in Canada.”

Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce response

On Dec. 4, the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce submitted its review of the labour relations provisions of The Saskatchewan Employment Act.

In the report, the Chamber recommended the Act be updated to clarify matters, such as, “how to conduct representation votes for remote or multi-site workforces; what constitutes access to employees for communications in digital workplaces; and how notice requirements apply when workers are geographically dispersed.”

The Chamber made 10 recommendations for the ministry, including: to “maintain an employer’s ability to bring in replacement workers, make the provincial construction collective agreements either opt-in, or opt-out, for unionized businesses in the construction industry and provide clear, plain-language guidance on lawful communication during organizing drives.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/648/files/2025/12/person-filling-out-tax-forms.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:59:35.518079

“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”

Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.

But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in U.S. waters.

The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​“The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.

Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”

And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.

The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.

Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes” — not wind development — were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.

At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power — the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance — appeared to be on the downswing, with many U.S. facilities having recently shuttered.

We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.

I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.

The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the U.S. seems impossible.

The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.

Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.

A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.

“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved. … I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.

Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own — namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.

“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction … and tactics that delay action.”

After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”

According to the D.C.-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.

For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.

It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.

Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm — a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware — were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”

The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.

“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”

At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration — first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.

Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.

He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.

The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”

Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.

Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”

In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone — ​“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.

He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.

Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them — as the Brown University researchers put it — was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.

His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.

There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the east coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.

Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.

I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”

But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted that the campaign prompted a U.S. General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)

Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms.

Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”

The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the U.S. — during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities — and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.

Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.

As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”

In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”

In this ongoing phenomena, 40% of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.

I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction — but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings” — an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf” — which helped secure a reversal from Trump.

Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.

At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.

Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built in America for the next decade — save for the five already under construction.

Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term.

“They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.

It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.

Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives — ones that go beyond whales — for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the U.S. vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)

Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”

The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change — and what to do about it — evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”

“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’ … A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”

These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”

Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​“Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment.” The book came out in early fall — just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life with a decade-long delay of U.S. offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.

Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32% jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.

“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy. … You don’t want 100% believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Madison–Wisconsin who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the U.S. is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.

Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seemed relieved to be doing so.

On our most recent call, in late November, Stevenson told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)

He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” Stevenson told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry — and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.

Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed offshore wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.

Stevenson also told me on the phone that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. Exxon Mobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.

I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.

Yesterday, more than 11 months after being inaugurated, President Trump vetoed his first bills of this term. Both had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. These were not divisive bills. So these vetoes pit the president against his fellow Republicans and raise the question of how far they might go to defy the president. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to walk us through details. Hey there.

DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.

KELLY: What did he veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, the first is a bill that would have helped communities in southeastern Colorado pay for a conduit that would carry clean water. The bill would have done that by giving them more time to repay money without interest to the federal government. Now, that conduit is important because residents there have dealt with unsafe water. Some of the groundwater is tainted with toxic elements like radium. The other bill deals with Florida. It would have expanded the area reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe and required the secretary of the interior to help safeguard communities there from flooding.

KELLY: OK. Let me take these one by one. The Colorado one, first, and this clean water conduit. Why did President Trump veto it?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, his stated reason is that the bill would force federal taxpayers to foot the bill for a local water project that, as initially envisioned, would have been paid for by the local communities. He added in a statement that he's committed to ending, quote, ""the massive cost of taxpayer handouts."" But it's important to get a sense of the scope here. Federal funding has paid for a large chunk of this project, but as our colleagues at Colorado Public Radio have pointed out, this particular bill would cost the federal government less than $500,000, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, which, in terms of federal spending, is absolutely tiny.

KELLY: May I ask about the language you just used? You just told us the president's stated reason for vetoing this. Is there a reason to think there are other motives in play?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Colorado Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has raised this possibility. In a statement, she said, quote, ""I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation."" She clashed with the president this year by pushing for the release of the Epstein files, but Trump has not explicitly linked that to his veto.

But in addition, Trump, earlier this year, threatened what he called harsh measures if a woman named Tina Peters was not released from a Colorado prison. Peters was a county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and she is serving a nine-year sentence for helping someone get access to voting equipment after the 2020 election. So the whole case is tied to conspiracy theories about election fraud. Earlier this month, Trump said he was pardoning Peters, but presidential pardons apply to federal crimes. Peters was convicted at the state level, so she remains in prison. Now, again, Trump has not explicitly linked Peters to this veto, but this morning, he posted on social media that he wants Peters freed, so we know she's on his mind.

KELLY: OK. Go to the other one, the Florida veto. What are the reasons, stated or otherwise, for that veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump was straightforward in saying this veto was in part about politics. He said in a statement that the Miccosukee Tribe, quote, ""has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies."" Now, that seems to refer to the tribe earlier this year joining a lawsuit against an immigration detention center the Trump administration created in Florida, the one the president calls Alligator Alcatraz. The tribe considers the land it's built on sacred.

KELLY: To circle back to something I said at the outset, that both these bills, Florida and Colorado, they passed with the support of the president's GOP colleagues in Congress, right?

KURTZLEBEN: Yes. In fact, they both passed the House and Senate without those person-by-person roll call votes. The bills just had so much support. They were able to pass via voice votes or unanimous consent. So now the question is whether Congress can or wants to override Trump's vetoes.

KELLY: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you, Danielle.

KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

KELLY: And Happy New Year.

KURTZLEBEN: You too.

In late December, two environmental organizations, the California Native Plant Society and the Environmental Council of Sacramento, filed a lawsuit against the County of Sacramento for its recent approval of the Coyote Creek Agrivoltaic Ranch project. That initiative, also known as the CCAR, is slated for the rolling hills and grazing lands of eastern Sacramento County between Prairie City SVRA and the Deer Creek Hills Preserve.

The environmental groups cited “numerous deficiencies” in the project’s Final Environmental Impact Report (final EIR), including failure to sufficiently address the potential impacts to two streams that flow into Deer Creek, a tributary of the Cosumnes River and the last Sierra Nevada watershed river without a major storage dam on it. The plaintiffs also pointed to the loss of 3,493 trees from the project that will be incurred from “industrial-level repurposing” of the land.

DESRI, the ownership behind the proposal, describes the Coyote Creek Agrivoltaic Ranch as a “renewable energy project” that will “deliver significant economic and environmental benefits to Sacramento County and the greater region.” DESRI is an investor and operator of renewable energy projects across the United States.

In a statement, DESRI argued that “independent economic modeling” by Economic and Planning Systems has projected that construction activities and related purchases of local goods and services for the agrivoltaic ranch will inject more than $365 million into the Sacramento economy.

“A major share of these benefits will come from the project’s commitment to employ highly trained union labor,” the company stated. “Construction of the solar and battery energy storage system is expected to create up to 350 good-paying jobs during the buildout period.”

William Risse, Director of Development at DESRI, weighed in directly.

“This project represents a significant investment in Sacramento County’s economy,” Risse asserted. “It will support new job creation and a resilient, skilled workforce while generating cost-effective and reliable power for the community.”

The Sacramento Metro Chamber of Commerce is backing the project, with Robert Heidt, the group’s President and CEO, insisting that initiatives like Coyote Creek “deliver lasting value for Sacramento County by generating millions in local investment and supporting hundreds of good-paying jobs.”

However, the environmental plaintiffs had warned county officials ahead of a Sacramento Board of Supervisors vote on Nov. 18 that the project that its final EIR “is so deeply flawed that it is insufficient to support informed decision-making.”

CNPS Conservation Program Director Nick Jensen stands behind that assessment.

“We’re talking about trees dating back to the time of Ghengis Khan and the Middle Ages—destroyed without appropriate due diligence and in conflict with the county’s own plans,” Jensen said, referencing the multiple ways the project is out of compliance with the Sacramento County General Plan.

Environmental Council Policy Analyst Luz Lim echoed Jensen’s concerns.

“This is not a choice between clean energy or irreplaceable habitat,” Luz contended. “We all want and need appropriately planned clean energy for our county, but thanks to other projects underway, SMUD is already on track to fulfill its 2030 Zero Net Carbon Plan. Instead, and ironically, we’re potentially destroying thousands of oaks, which are one of nature’s most powerful tools to trap and sequester carbon.”

Luz added that a single oak can sequester vast amounts of carbon each year and support as many as 300 different types of wildlife, making these native trees a “nature-based solution” to the impacts of climate change.

Some ecologists also use the term “keystone species” to describe oaks, because of their disproportionately large impact on ecosystems.

Critics say that one example of the final EIR’s deficiencies can be found in how it accounts for a 1:1 replacement of oak saplings for each mature oak removed. In contrast, the Sacramento County General Plan calls for one tree seedling for each inch of trunk diameter removed—a total 79,126.40 inches, according to the Arborist’s report for the project.

In a November Sacramento Bee article, U.C. Berkeley integrative biology professor Todd Dawson, said the mitigation is “severely misaligned with the timescale to reestablish ‘mature’ trees and the woodlands they would compose,” and explained that blue oak acorns are hard to grow successfully, and that young trees often die from heat, drought or being eaten by wildlife.

“The project also represents potential and significant ecological impacts to two perennial streams feeding into Deer Creek and ultimately the Cosumnes River; multiple sensitive or endangered species, such as tricolored blackbird, burrowing owl, and American badger,” the plaintiffs argued, “and 25% of the entire known occurrences of the rare western spiked rosinweed.”

Environmental advocates note that concern over the Coyote Creek project has “generated an outpouring” of local activism, including hundreds of people showing up for the November Board of Supervisors vote. More than 150 people spoke at the meeting, and more than 900 provided written comments, with 95% of them opposed to the project.”

“Destroying high quality intact habitat that is home to some of the highest biodiversity and highest capacity for carbon sequestration in the county is unacceptable and sets a dangerous precedent for future development,” said Carol Witham, an ecologist and representative of the local CNPS Sacramento Valley Chapter. “One of the largest threats to biodiversity is climate change, the approval of projects like this makes efforts to reduce this threat a threat of its own.”",https://sacramento.newsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lawsuit.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 10:58:57.843040

Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom.

The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus.

Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction.

""Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,"" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. ""It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?""

Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent ""excessive state regulation"" of AI.

""We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,"" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida.

""As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,"" the governor asked. ""I think most people would say they don't want it.""

DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last.

Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market.

Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November.

""We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,"" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy.

""We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,"" Silverman said.

The shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM.

The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. ""Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,"" the analyst said.

""It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,"" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.

PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia.

The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a ""massive wealth transfer,"" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.

""I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,"" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.

""And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,"" Gramlich said. ""Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.""

The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.

""By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,"" Silverman said. ""That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.""

Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027.

Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests.

But Silverman said ""co-location"" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.

""Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,"" he said. ""It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108234669-1764617288677-gettyimages-2229069495-DATA_CENTERS.jpeg?v=1766057941&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-01 10:12:55.173060

Data centers draw the ire of residents across the state

As a state law offering tax breaks on data center construction and equipment took effect earlier this year, tech companies are flocking to Michigan in hopes of building out additional facilities to advance artificial intelligence development while communities are increasingly pushing back against these projects.

In the past month, frustration from residents against the lack of transparency into many of these deals – with local officials and landowners bound by non-disclosure agreements – has hit a fever pitch with a few hundred residents gathering at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to push back against these developments.

While regulations specific to data centers are limited to the conditions for receiving the tax break, lawmakers are stepping up to address their constituents’ concerns, with a bipartisan group of House representatives introducing legislation to repeal the tax breaks for these resource-intensive facilities.

Another group of lawmakers in the Senate has put forth regulations to bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use from obtaining a water withdrawal permit, require the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish reports on data centers’ energy and water use and ensure residents don’t bear the cost of upgrading water systems to serve these facilities.

Line 5 lawsuits continue as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expedites review of tunnel project

Following a years-long legal battle over whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case to remove Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline from the Great Lakes should be heard in state or federal courts, the case returned to the Ingham County’s 30th Judicial Circuit Court in Lansing at the start of the year.

The United States Supreme Court has also agreed to hear an appeal of the decision that sent the case back to Michigan in the first place.

Additionally, attorneys for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether the state is immune from legal action for its decision to revoke Enbridge’s easement to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet.

A decision to take up this case could carry even further weight, with a federal judge barring the state from enforcing its notice terminating Enbridge’s easement to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes.

In yet another legal challenge before the Michigan Supreme Court, justices agreed to review whether the Michigan Public Service Commission – which oversees siting matters for pipelines within the state – erred in its decision to issue one of the permits needed for Enbridge to begin construction on its tunnel project.

The state’s highest court will hear two challenges, one filed by FLOW Water Advocates, and another filed by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs, including the Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

Opponents argue the commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac.

Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers’ long awaited environmental impact statement assessing the plan to replace the two segments of pipeline located in the Straits with a new segment placed in a tunnel embedded into the bedrock beneath the lake was issued in May.

An executive order issued by the Trump Administration in January has also permitted the project’s environmental review to move forward under a shortened timeline.

EPA lifts emergency order on Flint water, residents mark milestones on lead line replacement

More than 11 years after the beginning of the Flint Water Crisis, the United States Environmental Protection Agency lifted its emergency order on the city’s drinking water, which was put in place in 2016.

However, community members were quick to note that the decision, which came alongside the end of the city’s lead line replacement program, does not mean that the city’s pipes are lead free.

While Flint and the state of Michigan have met their obligations under a 2017 settlement requiring them to replace all lead lines in the city, several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes. Additionally, not all residents have agreed to have their homes checked or their pipes replaced.

The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Residents who need their lead lines replaced can call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.

The city’s recovery could also be hampered by a loss in funding, as Michigan House Republicans voted to eliminate $8.3 million in funding to support services across the city, as the water crisis continues to impact residents and children.

Palisades nuclear plant returns to operating status

In West Michigan, the first nuclear plant restart in the nation has entered its final phase, with plans to bring two small modular reactors online at the same site.

While the plant has not yet returned to energy production, it has been cleared to bring new fuel on site.

However, a host of anti-nuclear groups continue to raise concerns about the safety of the restart, with a trio of organizations filing a federal lawsuit arguing the plant is legally barred from resuming operations after entering decommissioning status.

Energy emergency draws challenge from Michigan AG

Since its issuance on Jan. 20, the Trump Administration’s energy emergency order has drawn criticism from environmentalists across the nation, alongside a legal challenge from Michigan’s attorney general.

Despite record breaking energy production in 2024, the Trump administration has proclaimed the nation’s energy resources to be insufficient, though Nessel and Democratic attorneys general from 14 other states are arguing the order is unlawful.

In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, and that the administration’s move to fast track permits for several activities tied to energy production undermine the rights of the states.

Alongside fast tracking the environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project, the Trump Administration has used the order as a justification to repeatedly extend operations at a West Michigan Coal plant that was slated to close at the end of May.

According to the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million between the initial extension issued on May 23, and Sept. 30. The latest extension, issued on Nov. 18, will keep the plant operating through Feb. 17, 2026. Nessel has challenged the extension.

Trump commits to supporting project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes

A decades-long project aimed at keeping invasive carp from establishing a foothold in the Great Lakes, secured support from the White House in May, following efforts from the Whitmer administration to ensure the project would receive funding allocated under former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The $1.15 billion dollar project, which secured its first construction contract in December 2024, is a joint effort sponsored by Michigan, Illinois and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The project targets a critical choke point near Joliet, Ill., instituting a series of deterrents to keep invasive carp and other nuisance species out of the Great Lakes.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that the carp could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region – including rivers and inland lakes – alongside the region’s $20 billion fishing and boating industries.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0417-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:59:26.832796

And in New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats “who are by no means radical leftists” ran successful campaigns focused on lowering utility costs, O’Hanlon said.
“We see them as real protagonists in the fight for what we [at the Climate and Community Institute] are calling ‘green economic populism,’” said Rithika Ramamurthy, communications director at the leftwing climate thinktank Climate and Community Institute.
And tenants’ unions are working to green their residences while protecting renters from climate disasters and rising bills, Ramamurthy said.
“The administration was great on connecting jobs and green energy,” she said.","A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the Trump administration derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.

Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.

“People increasingly understand how climate and costs of living are tied together,” she said.

Utility bills and healthcare costs are climbing as extreme weather intensifies. Public transit systems essential to climate goals are reeling from federal funding cuts. Rents are rising as landlords pass along costs of inefficient buildings, higher insurance and disaster repairs, turning climate risk into a monthly surcharge. Meanwhile, wealth inequality is surging under an administration that took record donations from big oil.

“We need to connect climate change to the everyday economic reality we are all facing in this country,” said O’Hanlon.

Progressive politicians have embraced that notion. Zohran Mamdani, New York City’s democratic socialist mayor-elect, has advanced affordability-first climate policies such as free buses to reduce car use, and a plan to make schools more climate-resilient. Seattle’s socialist mayor-elect, Katie Wilson, says she will boost social housing while pursuing green retrofits.

Maine’s US Senate hopeful Graham Platner is pairing calls to rein in polluters and protect waterways with a critique of oligarchic politics. In Nebraska, independent US Senate candidate Dan Osborn backs right-to-repair laws that let farmers and consumers fix equipment – an approach he doesn’t frame as climate policy, but one that climate advocates say could reduce emissions from manufacturing. And in New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats “who are by no means radical leftists” ran successful campaigns focused on lowering utility costs, O’Hanlon said.

Movements nationwide are also working to cut emissions while building economic power. Chicago’s teachers’ union secured a contract requiring solar panels to be added to schools and creating clean-energy career pathways for students. Educators’ unions in Los Angeles and Minneapolis are also seeking to improve conditions for staff and students while decarbonizing.

“We see them as real protagonists in the fight for what we [at the Climate and Community Institute] are calling ‘green economic populism,’” said Rithika Ramamurthy, communications director at the leftwing climate thinktank Climate and Community Institute.

From Maine to Texas, organized labor is also pushing for a unionized workforce to decarbonize energy and buildings. And tenants’ unions are working to green their residences while protecting renters from climate disasters and rising bills, Ramamurthy said. From Connecticut to California, they are fighting for eviction protections, which can prevent post-disaster displacement and empower tenants to demand green upgrades. Some are also directly advocating for climate-friendly retrofits.

Movements are also working to expand public ownership energy, which proponents say can strengthen democratic control and lower rates by eliminating shareholder profits. In New York, a coalition won a 2023 policy directing the state-owned utility to build renewable energy with a unionized workforce, and advocates are pursuing a consumer-owned utility in Maine and a public takeover of the local utility in Baltimore.

To hold polluters accountable for their climate contributions, activists and lawmakers across the country are championing policies that would force them to help pay to curb emissions and boost resilience. Vermont and New York passed such “climate superfund” laws this year, while New York and Maine are expected to vote on such measures soon. And legislators in other states are looking to introduce or reintroduce bills in 2026, even as the Trump administration attempts to kill the laws.

“When insurance becomes unaffordable and states are constantly rebuilding after disasters, people don’t need some technical explanation to know that something is seriously wrong,” said Cassidy DiPaola, spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign. “Climate superfunds connect those costs to accountability by saying that the companies that caused the damage shouldn’t be shielded from paying for it.” Polls show the bills appear popular, she said.

Speaking to people’s financial concerns can help build support for climate policy, said DiPaola. Polls show voters support accountability measures against polluters and that most believe the climate crisis is driving up costs of living.

“The fastest way to depolarize climate is to simply talk about who’s paying and who’s profiting,” she said. “People disagree about a lot of things, but they do understand being ripped off.”

Linking green initiatives with economic concerns isn’t new. It was central to the Green New Deal, popularized by the Sunrise Movement and politicians like the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018. That push informed Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included the biggest climate investments in US history. But critics argue the IRA fell short of building economic power among ordinary people.

Though it boosted green manufacturing and created some 400,000 new jobs, those benefits were not tangible to most Americans, said Ramamurthy. Proposed investments in housing and public transit – which may have been more visible – were scaled back in the final package. Its incentives also largely went to private companies and wealthier households. A 2024 poll found only 24% of registered voters thought the IRA helped them.

“The IRA focused on creating incentives for capital, relying almost entirely on carrots with very few sticks,” said Ramamurthy.

While it advanced renewables, the IRA also contained handouts for polluters, O’Hanlon said. And Biden did not pair its passage with messaging acknowledging economic hardship, she said.

“The administration was great on connecting jobs and green energy,” she said. “But they said the economy was doing well, which felt out of touch.”

Trump capitalized on Americans’ economic anxieties, said O’Hanlon, but has not offered them relief.

“We need a vision that can actually combat the narrative Trump has been putting out,” she said. “We need a vision for addressing the climate crisis alongside making life better for for working people.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63c31ba1ccf48119ca7a861af1e53e9331976f7a/232_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c6c4eb8cb6e7610eddee3d5d03b35c5",N,,2026-01-01 10:59:02.368022

The share price has slipped over the past week after a choppy quarter where investor enthusiasm over buybacks and resilient truck profits kept colliding with worries about EV execution, Cruise uncertainty and a more fragile U.S. consumer. The result is a market narrative that feels split: value investors see a cheap industrial cash machine, while growth investors are still waiting to be convinced that GM can credibly rival Tesla and the fast?moving Chinese EV players.

Market Pulse: Price, Trend and Technical Setting

According to real?time quotes from Yahoo Finance and cross?checked against Google Finance and Reuters, General Motors Co stock last closed at approximately 36.50 US dollars per share in the final trading session before the new year. Intraday data for the current session was not yet available at the time of research, so this last close is the operative reference point. Over the past five trading days, the stock has drifted modestly lower, giving back part of the strong rally it enjoyed earlier in the quarter.

Over this recent five?day stretch, GM shares have traded in a relatively tight band between roughly the mid?36s and just under 38 dollars, with two small down days outweighing a couple of hesitant rebounds. The short?term tape suggests some profit taking after a sharp move up in the prior weeks, rather than an outright collapse in conviction. Volume has cooled from the spike seen around major news on labor costs and Cruise, pointing to a short consolidation rather than panic selling.

Stepping back to a 90?day view, the stock is still comfortably in positive territory versus its early?autumn levels. GM has climbed from the high?20s to the mid?30s, helped by upbeat guidance revisions, aggressive share buybacks and the market’s broader pivot toward cyclical and value names as rate?cut hopes crept back into the macro narrative. The 52?week range crystallizes just how bruising the earlier part of the year was: the stock’s low sat around the high?20s, while its 52?week high reached into the low?40s. Trading in the mid?30s today leaves GM below the top of that range, but well off its trough, encapsulating a story of partial recovery with lingering skepticism.

One-Year Investment Performance

An investor who bought General Motors Co stock exactly one year ago at roughly 34.00 US dollars per share, and held through all the strikes, EV headlines and Cruise turbulence, would now be sitting on a modest gain with the stock around 36.50. That equates to a price return of about 7 to 8 percent, before any dividends. It is hardly the stuff of meme?stock legend, but in a year when auto names were routinely whipsawed by supply chain concerns, regulatory noise and demand jitters, it represents a quietly respectable outcome.

The emotional journey, however, was far from calm. At various points in the past twelve months, GM traded deep in the red versus that entry price, especially during the height of labor disputes and after high?profile setbacks at Cruise. For an investor, staying invested required a strong stomach and a clear thesis that GM’s cash?generating truck and SUV core could shoulder the weight of ambitious EV and software spending. Those who did not flinch are now modestly ahead, and if dividends are factored in, the total return looks slightly better than the bare share price suggests.

Still, the opportunity cost question lingers. Compared with the soaring returns in parts of the tech sector or niche EV winners during their hottest stretches, GM’s one?year payoff feels subdued. That contrast fuels an ongoing debate: is GM a patient investor’s compounding story in disguise, or is it fundamentally capped by its capital intensity and the political and regulatory headwinds facing the traditional auto industry?

Recent Catalysts and News

In the past few days, the GM news flow has been less about headline?grabbing product launches and more about execution details and cleanup operations in its advanced tech portfolio. After pausing most operations at Cruise following a high?profile pedestrian incident and regulatory scrutiny, GM has been busy reshaping the unit’s leadership and strategy. Fresh reporting from Reuters and other outlets pointed to leadership changes at Cruise and an intensified focus on safety culture and phased redeployment, signaling a desire to preserve the long?term autonomous opportunity while staunching reputational and financial damage in the near term.

Earlier in the week, investor attention gravitated toward GM’s capital allocation posture. Management has continued to signal commitment to sizeable share repurchases and a gradually more generous dividend, supported by robust profitability in its North American truck and SUV business. Commentary from financial media such as Bloomberg and CNBC highlighted how GM is trying to reassure shareholders that, despite rising labor costs following the latest union agreements, it can sustain healthy margins and return capital without derailing its multibillion?dollar EV roadmap.

At the product level, the latest stories have underscored a tactical recalibration rather than a wholesale retreat from EVs. Reports referenced GM’s decision to pace some EV launches and adjust production schedules, especially for higher?end models, in response to more cautious demand signals and a fiercely competitive pricing environment. This has been framed as an attempt to avoid overbuilding inventory and discounting too aggressively, even as the company pushes ahead with its Ultium battery platform and broadens its lineup from premium trucks and SUVs into more mass?market segments.

There has also been ongoing coverage of GM’s software and services strategy, from incremental over?the?air feature monetization to the evolution of subscription?based offerings. While none of these updates individually moved the stock dramatically in recent sessions, they collectively feed into the narrative that GM is trying to pivot from a purely hardware?driven business model toward a more recurring?revenue, data?driven ecosystem, even if investors continue to demand proof that these ambitions can materially shift the valuation needle.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Over the past month, several major investment banks have updated their views on General Motors Co, and their verdict skews cautiously constructive. Research notes from firms such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, referenced in summaries on financial portals like Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, generally carry Buy or Overweight ratings, with 12?month price targets clustered in the low to mid?40s. Relative to the current share price around 36.50, that implies double?digit upside if management can execute on its promises.

J.P. Morgan’s analysts, for example, have emphasized GM’s attractive earnings multiple compared with both the broader market and the automotive peer group, arguing that the stock discounts overly dire scenarios around EV profitability and ongoing labor cost inflation. Goldman Sachs has framed GM as a cyclical value play with embedded real options in EVs and autonomous driving, suggesting that even if those long?dated options do not fully pay off, investors are still buying a solid truck?led cash engine at a discount.

Not all commentary is unqualified praise. Some European houses, including Deutsche Bank, have maintained more neutral stances, with Hold or equivalent ratings. Their reservations often center on execution risk in scaling Ultium production, the pace of consumer EV adoption in a higher?rate environment and the uncertain trajectory of Cruise’s regulatory landscape. They also highlight that GM’s earnings remain highly concentrated in North America and especially in full?size pickup and SUV segments, leaving the company vulnerable if that profit pool comes under pressure.

Across these voices, a consensus picture emerges: Wall Street is not in love with GM, but it is increasingly willing to own it at the right price. The stock is largely framed as undervalued relative to its cash flow, with analysts eyeing potential upside from continued buybacks, margin defense in core trucks and incremental progress on EV and software monetization. At the same time, most research flags clear downside risks if EV margins disappoint further or if Cruise becomes a deeper financial drain than currently modeled.

Future Prospects and Strategy

General Motors Co today is a hybrid of old?school Detroit metal and next?generation mobility ambition. At its core, the company still makes its money from selling high?margin pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers in North America, supported by a global but more volatile portfolio of brands. That legacy business throws off the cash needed to fund an aggressive pivot toward electric vehicles based on the Ultium battery platform, along with investments in software, connectivity and autonomous driving via Cruise and other initiatives.

In the coming months, the market will be watching three strategic levers. First is EV execution: can GM ramp production reliably, control warranty and quality issues, and bring battery costs down fast enough to preserve margins while still pricing competitively against Tesla and ambitious Chinese rivals? Second is cost discipline: after the recent union agreements, investors will scrutinize whether GM can offset higher labor expenses through efficiencies, mix management and disciplined capital spending. Third is credibility in high?tech bets: the company needs to show that Cruise can eventually return to controlled, safe growth and that in?vehicle software and services can create recurring revenue rather than being seen as a cost center.

If GM can thread that needle, the current share price could mark a staging ground for a more durable rerating, as the market begins to treat it less like a shrinking combustion?engine incumbent and more like a cash?rich transition story. However, if EV demand softens further, if regulatory scrutiny on autonomous driving intensifies or if a macro slowdown hits U.S. truck demand, the stock could slide back toward the lower end of its 52?week range. For now, GM remains a nuanced proposition: a value?tilted stock with cyclical sensitivity and high?beta optionality in EVs and autonomy, asking investors to balance healthy present?day profits against a future that is still very much under construction.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404989_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 10:59:11.267962

In the waning days of 2025, the Trump administration delivered a dramatic intervention in the energy sector, issuing an emergency order to keep an aging coal-fired power plant in northwestern Colorado operational just one day before its scheduled shutdown. The Craig Station’s Unit 1, a facility long earmarked for retirement amid shifting economic and environmental pressures, was thrust back into the spotlight by a directive from the Department of Energy. This move, aimed at averting what officials described as a potential power emergency, underscores the administration’s unwavering commitment to bolstering coal as a cornerstone of U.S. energy security. Critics, however, decry it as a costly and environmentally regressive ploy that burdens ratepayers and delays the inevitable transition to cleaner alternatives.

The order, detailed in reports from Colorado Public Radio, mandates that the plant remain available beyond its December 31 retirement date. Federal energy officials justified the action by citing grid reliability concerns, particularly in the face of growing demands from data centers and extreme weather events. Yet, this isn’t an isolated incident; it fits into a broader pattern of interventions where the administration has repeatedly stepped in to extend the lifespans of coal plants across the country. For instance, earlier in the year, similar orders kept facilities in Indiana and other states online, as noted in coverage from The New York Times.

Environmental groups and local officials have responded with swift condemnation, arguing that the decision ignores the plant’s history of pollution and the economic realities driving its closure. In Colorado, where the push for renewable energy has gained significant traction, the order has sparked a backlash from state leaders who view it as federal overreach. According to The Colorado Sun, the plant’s operator had already invested in decommissioning plans, and the sudden reversal could impose millions in additional costs on consumers without addressing underlying grid vulnerabilities.

The Administration’s Coal Revival Strategy Takes Shape

This latest directive builds on a series of executive actions throughout 2025 that have systematically dismantled regulatory barriers to coal production and consumption. President Trump’s inauguration in January marked the beginning of a aggressive pivot toward fossil fuels, with policies designed to “unleash American energy” as a counter to what the administration portrays as burdensome environmental rules from previous years. A comprehensive overview in The Hill highlights how these changes include loosening emissions standards, extending toxic waste disposal timelines for coal ash, and allocating substantial federal funds to subsidize the industry.

One pivotal move came in September, when the administration announced a $625 million investment to revive coal operations, including opening 13.1 million acres of public land for mining. This initiative, reported by The Guardian, aims to counteract the rapid decline of coal’s role in U.S. electricity generation, which has plummeted from about 50% in 2000 to just 15% in 2024. Proponents argue that such measures are essential for maintaining energy independence, especially as global competitors like China continue to expand their coal fleets. Posts on X from users like those affiliated with pro-administration accounts emphasize this point, noting that while China added 243 coal plants in 2024, U.S. grid reliability has suffered under prior restrictive policies.

Beyond financial incentives, the administration has leveraged emergency powers under the Federal Power Act to mandate plant operations. The Craig order echoes a June intervention where coal and gas plants were kept open despite grid operators’ assertions that no such emergency existed, as detailed in another New York Times article. These actions have raised questions about the true motivations, with some industry analysts suggesting they serve more as political theater to fulfill campaign promises to coal-dependent communities than as genuine solutions to energy shortages.

Environmental and Economic Ramifications Unfold

The environmental toll of prolonging coal plant operations is a central point of contention. Coal combustion remains a major source of carbon emissions, particulate matter, and toxic pollutants, contributing to respiratory illnesses and climate change. Environmental advocacy groups, such as those quoted in a press release from Earthjustice, warn that the Craig extension will exacerbate air quality issues in rural Colorado, where communities have already borne the brunt of the plant’s emissions for decades. This comes at a time when renewable sources like wind and solar have surpassed coal in electricity production, signaling a market-driven shift that federal interventions may only temporarily delay.

Economically, the costs are equally stark. Ratepayers could face millions in additional expenses to keep outdated facilities running, including maintenance, fuel, and compliance with lingering regulations. Coverage from CNN estimates that similar orders elsewhere have already burdened consumers, with no clear benefits to grid stability. In Colorado, local economies tied to coal mining and power generation stand to gain short-term job preservation, but experts argue this hinders investment in retraining programs and renewable infrastructure that could provide more sustainable employment.

Moreover, the policy intersects with emerging demands from the tech sector. As AI data centers proliferate, requiring vast amounts of reliable power, the administration has positioned coal as a “critical mineral” to fuel this growth. Executive orders from April, as shared in posts on X by influential accounts, directed agencies to support coal production explicitly for these purposes, framing it as vital for national security. This narrative contrasts sharply with global trends toward decarbonization, where even coal-heavy nations are exploring transitions.

Policy Precedents and Legal Challenges Emerge

Tracing back, the Trump administration’s approach draws from earlier efforts to classify energy resources strategically. A November proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency, outlined in The Hill, sought to extend waste-disposal practices for coal plants, effectively granting them more time to operate without stringent upgrades. This regulatory relief is part of a larger rollback of Obama- and Biden-era rules, including carbon emission standards that the administration has moved to repeal without replacements, as highlighted in X posts criticizing the lack of plans for major pollution sources.

Legal battles are already brewing. Colorado officials and environmental litigants are preparing challenges, arguing that the emergency declaration lacks substantiation. Similar disputes over past orders have questioned whether the Department of Energy’s actions violate the Federal Power Act by imposing undue costs without operator requests. Reports from PostIndependent.com indicate that the Craig plant’s grid operator never sought the extension, fueling accusations of political interference.

Industry insiders note that these interventions could set precedents for future administrations, potentially politicizing energy reliability decisions. With coal’s market share eroding due to cheaper natural gas and renewables, such orders might deter private investment in modern infrastructure, perpetuating a cycle of dependency on federal bailouts.

Broader Implications for Energy Security and Innovation

Looking ahead, the administration’s coal-centric policies raise fundamental questions about America’s energy future. By prioritizing fossil fuels, they may undermine incentives for innovation in carbon capture, storage, and other technologies that could make coal more viable in a low-emission world. X posts from pro-coal advocates praise initiatives like the COAL POWER Act, which repeals prior EPA restrictions and invests in retrofitting, but critics counter that these funds could better support grid modernization and renewable integration.

In the context of international relations, this stance positions the U.S. as an outlier amid global efforts to phase out coal. While the administration touts energy dominance—echoed in executive orders guaranteeing protections for coal companies—the environmental community warns of long-term risks, including intensified climate impacts. Bloomberg’s analysis, referenced in X discussions, catalogs over 180 rollbacks in 2025 alone, from soot rules to particulate limits, painting a picture of aggressive deregulation.

For coal-dependent regions like northwestern Colorado, the order offers a temporary reprieve, preserving jobs in mining and operations. Yet, as detailed in WDBO, this comes at the expense of broader economic diversification. Communities are caught between immediate livelihoods and the promise of green jobs, with state initiatives for just transitions now complicated by federal mandates.

Navigating the Path Forward Amid Uncertainty

As 2026 dawns, the Craig plant’s fate symbolizes the tension between legacy industries and evolving energy needs. The administration’s actions, while fulfilling pledges to revitalize coal, invite scrutiny over their efficacy and equity. Will these orders truly enhance grid resilience, or merely postpone coal’s decline at great cost? Industry observers suggest that without complementary investments in transmission and storage, such measures risk isolating the U.S. from global clean energy advancements.

Environmental groups continue to mobilize, leveraging public sentiment evident in X posts decrying the “climate onslaught.” Legal avenues remain open, with potential court rulings that could curtail the use of emergency powers for industrial lifelines. Meanwhile, the tech-driven demand for power presents an opportunity to bridge divides, perhaps by hybridizing coal with renewables in innovative ways.

Ultimately, the Trump administration’s coal policies reflect a high-stakes bet on traditional energy sources amid rapid change. As debates intensify, the outcomes will shape not only Colorado’s horizons but the nation’s trajectory toward sustainable power. For now, the embers of coal burn on, fueled by political will and contested visions of progress.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-5240-1767248051.jpeg,N,,2026-01-01 13:13:20.347208

With those stories in mind, the Advance is looking back on its biggest environmental stories of 2025.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Data centers draw the ire of residents across the state

As a state law offering tax breaks on data center construction and equipment took effect earlier this year, tech companies are flocking to Michigan in hopes of building out additional facilities to advance artificial intelligence development while communities are increasingly pushing back against these projects.

In the past month, frustration from residents against the lack of transparency into many of these deals – with local officials and landowners bound by non-disclosure agreements – has hit a fever pitch with a few hundred residents gathering at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to push back against these developments.

While regulations specific to data centers are limited to the conditions for receiving the tax break, lawmakers are stepping up to address their constituents’ concerns, with a bipartisan group of House representatives introducing legislation to repeal the tax breaks for these resource-intensive facilities.

Another group of lawmakers in the Senate has put forth regulations to bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use from obtaining a water withdrawal permit, require the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish reports on data centers’ energy and water use and ensure residents don’t bear the cost of upgrading water systems to serve these facilities.

Line 5 lawsuits continue as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expedites review of tunnel project

Following a years-long legal battle over whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case to remove Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline from the Great Lakes should be heard in state or federal courts, the case returned to the Ingham County’s 30th Judicial Circuit Court in Lansing at the start of the year.

The United States Supreme Court has also agreed to hear an appeal of the decision that sent the case back to Michigan in the first place.

Additionally, attorneys for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether the state is immune from legal action for its decision to revoke Enbridge’s easement to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet.

A decision to take up this case could carry even further weight, with a federal judge barring the state from enforcing its notice terminating Enbridge’s easement to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes.

In yet another legal challenge before the Michigan Supreme Court, justices agreed to review whether the Michigan Public Service Commission – which oversees siting matters for pipelines within the state – erred in its decision to issue one of the permits needed for Enbridge to begin construction on its tunnel project.

The state’s highest court will hear two challenges, one filed by FLOW Water Advocates, and another filed by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs, including the Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

Opponents argue the commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac.

Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers’ long awaited environmental impact statement assessing the plan to replace the two segments of pipeline located in the Straits with a new segment placed in a tunnel embedded into the bedrock beneath the lake was issued in May.

An executive order issued by the Trump Administration in January has also permitted the project’s environmental review to move forward under a shortened timeline.

EPA lifts emergency order on Flint water, residents mark milestones on lead line replacement

More than 11 years after the beginning of the Flint Water Crisis, the United States Environmental Protection Agency lifted its emergency order on the city’s drinking water, which was put in place in 2016.

However, community members were quick to note that the decision, which came alongside the end of the city’s lead line replacement program, does not mean that the city’s pipes are lead free.

While Flint and the state of Michigan have met their obligations under a 2017 settlement requiring them to replace all lead lines in the city, several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes. Additionally, not all residents have agreed to have their homes checked or their pipes replaced.

The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Residents who need their lead lines replaced can call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.

The city’s recovery could also be hampered by a loss in funding, as Michigan House Republicans voted to eliminate $8.3 million in funding to support services across the city, as the water crisis continues to impact residents and children.

Palisades nuclear plant returns to operating status

In West Michigan, the first nuclear plant restart in the nation has entered its final phase, with plans to bring two small modular reactors online at the same site.

While the plant has not yet returned to energy production, it has been cleared to bring new fuel on site.

However, a host of anti-nuclear groups continue to raise concerns about the safety of the restart, with a trio of organizations filing a federal lawsuit arguing the plant is legally barred from resuming operations after entering decommissioning status.

Energy emergency draws challenge from Michigan AG

Since its issuance on Jan. 20, the Trump Administration’s energy emergency order has drawn criticism from environmentalists across the nation, alongside a legal challenge from Michigan’s attorney general.

Despite record breaking energy production in 2024, the Trump administration has proclaimed the nation’s energy resources to be insufficient, though Nessel and Democratic attorneys general from 14 other states are arguing the order is unlawful.

In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, and that the administration’s move to fast track permits for several activities tied to energy production undermine the rights of the states.

Alongside fast tracking the environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project, the Trump Administration has used the order as a justification to repeatedly extend operations at a West Michigan Coal plant that was slated to close at the end of May.

According to the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million between the initial extension issued on May 23, and Sept. 30. The latest extension, issued on Nov. 18, will keep the plant operating through Feb. 17, 2026. Nessel has challenged the extension.

Trump commits to supporting project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes

A decades-long project aimed at keeping invasive carp from establishing a foothold in the Great Lakes, secured support from the White House in May, following efforts from the Whitmer administration to ensure the project would receive funding allocated under former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The $1.15 billion dollar project, which secured its first construction contract in December 2024, is a joint effort sponsored by Michigan, Illinois and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

As 2026 begins, data and market trends reveal a turning point, from early adoption to mainstream momentum. What do the numbers really say about India's EV drive?

Passenger Vehicle Boom Continues

India's electric passenger vehicle segment saw record growth in 2025, clocking over 1.6 lakh units sold between January and November, a 78 percent year-on-year surge. Leading automakers like Tata Motors, JSW-MG Motor, and Mahindra & Mahindra continued to shape this fast-evolving segment.

Globally, electric mobility maintained its upward curve, China achieved 50 percent EV penetration in auto sales, and worldwide, one in four vehicles sold was electric. Interestingly, emerging markets such as Thailand and Vietnam outpaced several advanced economies, even as Europe faced headwinds due to subsidy cuts and rising costs. The EU is reportedly rethinking its 2035 gasoline vehicle ban, showing how dynamic the global EV landscape now is.

Two-Wheelers Hit a Temporary Slowdown

On the two-wheeler front, the momentum slowed toward the end of 2025. A recent GST overhaul made traditional internal combustion commuter motorcycles cheaper, prompting a short-term slump in EV demand.

According to industry data, sales fell from around 1.43 lakh units in October to nearly 1.17 lakh in November, following a strong run earlier in the year. Still, market leaders such as TVS, Bajaj, Ather Energy, and Hero MotoCorp remain optimistic, especially as EV penetration in two-wheelers crossed the 5 percent mark in 2025, a significant milestone for the sector.

Launch Wave Keeps EV Buzz Alive

Manufacturers were relentless through 2025, introducing a slew of new products to maintain excitement and encourage wider adoption. From design innovations to improved range and performance, the competition intensified across price segments.

Major automakers, Mahindra, Tata Motors, and Hyundai, led from the front, while global EV giants like VinFast and Tesla signalled renewed confidence with their India plans. In 2026, analysts expect electric passenger vehicle penetration to hit double digits, driven by expanding model portfolios and enhanced charging availability.

The Road Ahead: Premium And Local

The two-wheeler space is now headed for a premium turn. Upcoming launches from Royal Enfield, Yamaha, and Ultraviolette promise to bring performance-oriented choices to the segment. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki's long-awaited e-Vitara is expected to enter the market soon, marking its first step into the EV space.

Other brands like Hyundai, Honda, and Volkswagen are set to ramp up their electric portfolios, further intensifying competition among domestic and global players.

Policy Push Powers Local Manufacturing

India's EV growth is being bolstered by strong government programs. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme continues to boost local manufacturing of advanced automotive components, while the PM e-Drive initiative is incentivising electric two and three-wheelers, buses, and public charging networks.

Major investments from Tata Group, Ola Electric, and Suzuki are shaping India's EV battery manufacturing ecosystem, with large-scale lithium-ion gigafactories already under development. This domestic manufacturing focus is poised to cut dependence on imports and push technological innovation further.

Mainstream Moment Ahead

EV ownership in India is no longer a novelty. Lower running costs, zero tailpipe emissions, and peppy urban performance are drawing more buyers into the fold. With battery prices stabilizing and charging infrastructure expanding rapidly across metros and highways, 2026 could be the year electric mobility turns truly mainstream.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2026-01/cui0l79c_ev-rep_625x300_01_January_26.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=800",N,,2026-01-01 07:57:40.713181

The EPA’s National Recycling Strategy identifies access gaps in underserved regions as key obstacles to achieving national recycling goals.","Despite decades of environmental policy and public awareness initiatives, recycling access in the United States remains highly uneven. While many urban centers benefit from established infrastructure for materials recovery and recycling, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that a large share of rural and economically underserved communities lacks practical access to recycling services. This disparity undermines national sustainability goals and limits the economic potential of recovered materials.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the national recycling rate for plastics has stagnated at approximately 8.7, and most mixed plastics—especially resin types #3 through #7—are rarely recovered for reuse or remanufacture. Meanwhile, the National Academies’ Municipal Solid Waste Recycling in the United States report indicates that that could be recycled are instead lost due to insufficient regional infrastructure, prohibitive transport costs, and lack of accessible local processing capacity. These structural deficiencies result in millions of tons of recyclable waste being sent to landfills each year rather than being transformed into economically valuable products.

This access gap is particularly acute in the southeastern and midwestern United States, where counties often lack the population density and economic base necessary to support traditional recycling facilities. Such disparities reflect not a lack of public willingness to recycle but rather the absence of accessible, cost-effective processing options.

Why Traditional Recycling Models Don’t Work Everywhere

Traditional material recovery facilities (MRFs) operate on centralized models that depend on large, consistent volumes of feedstock, proximity to population centers, and substantial capital investment. These conditions tend to be met in large metropolitan areas but rarely in rural or economically distressed regions.

Several structural constraints challenge centralized recycling models:

Low population density diminishes the economies of scale needed to justify fixed facilities.

Long hauling distances raise the cost of transporting waste to distant MRFs, often exceeding the value of the recyclables themselves.

Limited municipal budgets restrict the ability of smaller jurisdictions to co-finance or maintain recycling infrastructure.

Lengthy permitting and construction timelines delay project deployment and raise overall costs.

These dynamics mean that even communities with a strong desire to participate in recycling are often unable to do so, not because they lack interest, but because existing systems are simply economically and logistically impractical for them.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted that expanding centralized facilities alone will not close the recycling access gap, [LINK ADDED] particularly for plastics and other hard-to-recycle materials.

What Decentralized and Mobile Recycling Models Offer

In the United States, a real-world example of decentralized recycling is the Mobile PET Plastic Ocean Waste Recycler pilot in Alaska. Developed with support from USDA NIFA SBIR and EPA SBIR programs, the project resulted in a transportable recycling unit deployed in multiple Alaskan communities. While the project concluded at the pilot stage without confirmed large-scale commercialization, it demonstrated the practical feasibility of mobile, community-level plastic recycling in regions lacking centralized infrastructure.

Mobile systems are generally modular and scalable, incorporating equipment for sorting, cleaning, and processing recyclable materials into usable forms.

For plastics #3 through #7, this might include recycling mixed waste to make construction products such as paving tiles, modular building components, or feedstock for secondary manufacturing.

The operational advantages of mobile recycling include:

Flexibility to serve multiple jurisdictions with a single unit,

Lower capital barriers compared to fixed infrastructure,

Adaptive deployment responding to local demand and seasonal changes,

Direct integration with existing municipal or commercial waste flows.

These characteristics make decentralized recycling especially suited to regions with variable waste volumes and limited access to conventional MRFs.

Environmental and Economic Benefits of Decentralized Recycling

Decentralized recycling models create measurable environmental and economic impacts. Environmentally, localized recycling reduces landfill dependence and associated greenhouse gas emissions from long-distance waste transport. Diverting plastics from landfills helps preserve limited landfill airspace and supports broader sustainability goals outlined in federal strategies like the EPA’s National Recycling Strategy.

Economically, mobile recycling expands local market activity by:

Creating jobs in operations, logistics, and materials handling;

Retaining material value within regional economies instead of exporting raw waste;

Supporting downstream industries that utilize recycled feedstocks;

Reducing long-term waste management costs for municipalities.

The analytical framework used by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), particularly the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II), underscores how infrastructure investments generate direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts at the local and state levels. By enabling localized recycling capacity, decentralized models help catalyze these regional economic multipliers.

For example, a mobile unit capable of processing approximately 1,000 tons of mixed plastics annually contributes to waste diversion, local employment, and supply chain development without the need for extensive fixed facilities.

Practical Actions Communities Can Take

Local action is critical to lead national policy toward a distributed, effective recycling solution. Talk to your local representatives about projects that can set the example for the nation.

Pilot programs for mobile recycling units in areas identified as underserved or economically distressed.

Public–private partnerships to mitigate investment risks and share operational responsibilities.

Regional collaborations where clusters of counties share mobile units and associated infrastructure.

Integration with local industry by using recycled products in public works and construction projects.

Tapping state and federal resources, including EPA grants and programs authorized under the Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act (RIAA), which emphasize accessibility in addition to capacity.

These steps allow communities to test and refine systems based on empirical data and demand, rather than speculative large-scale investments.

Why Decentralized Recycling Models Will Matter More in the Future

Federal policy momentum reflects a growing recognition of the limitations of traditional recycling infrastructure. The EPA’s National Recycling Strategy identifies access gaps in underserved regions as key obstacles to achieving national recycling goals. The Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act similarly highlights the need for flexible, distributed solutions to meet evolving recycling targets.

As recycling goals rise nationally, such as the EPA’s target of a 50 percent recycling rate by 2030—mobile and decentralized models will become increasingly important. These systems are not intended to replace established MRFs but to complement them by closing geographic and economic gaps.

Steps Forward

The United States faces a structural recycling challenge: millions of tons of material that could be recycled are lost annually because existing infrastructure fails to serve large portions of the country. The problem is not one of public behavior but of system design.

Decentralized and mobile recycling models provide a practical, economically grounded solution to this challenge. By bringing processing capacity directly to underserved regions, these systems reduce landfill dependence, support local economies, and foster resilient regional supply chains. As national recycling goals evolve, flexible, scalable infrastructure solutions will play a central role in ensuring equitable recycling access and advancing sustainability

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

New Jersey is investing nearly $11 million to restore coastal salt marshes, including a major project at Scotch Bonnet Island in Cape May County.

Tidal salt marshes mitigate the effects of incoming waves and reduce flooding in the area, while storing climate-changing carbon. Birds, reptiles and fish also rely on these wetlands to survive and thrive.

But tidal salt marshes are drowning as they face rapidly rising sea level at a rate faster than they can handle. As a result, the marsh grasses are growing more slowly and are being replaced by mudflats.

Since the 1950s, the marshes of Scotch Bonnet Island have lost more than 30% of their surface area to deluge. In the last five years, the salt marsh trail has flooded on average almost 70 times each year.

A new $2.7 million state grant will help the Wetlands Institute in Stone Harbor restore tidal wetland vegetation at Scotch Bonnet Island to address the impacts of sea level rise.

“As you increase storm impacts and reduce marshes, it’s a double whammy,” said Lenore Tedesco, executive director of the institute. “Maintaining these nature-based solutions or natural features that are supporting us and helping us is really going to be important.”

Scotch Bonnet Island is one of three sites to receive funding from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection totaling almost $11 million.

The grants are part of the state’s Natural Climate Solutions program, which aims to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has dedicated more than $54 million to the program, which is funded through the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

The most recent round of funding includes $3 million to help Montclair State University plant 910 trees to sequester carbon and filter air and water pollutants. Another $5 million will help Stafford Township in Ocean County restore 23 acres of tidal salt marsh.

“New Jersey communities are harnessing nature-based solutions to restore and protect the integrity of coastal and forest ecosystems which serve as critical carbon sinks that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” DEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said in a statement. “These investments also improve natural buffers such as wetlands and urban forests that protect communities and infrastructure from flooding and increasingly more severe storm impacts as a result of our changing climate.”

The Wetlands Institute, in partnership with the Borough of Avalon, will use the grant to raise the salt marsh trail at Scotch Bonnet Island by about 2 to 3 feet. The institute will also replant the area with hundreds of native marsh vegetation and restore nesting habitat for diamondback terrapins and coastal birds.

The funding comes as the Environmental Protection Agency proposes changes to the definition of “waters of the United States” that would limit the types of waterways protected under the Clean Water Act.

The change would codify a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that removed federal protections for wetlands that are either seasonal or aren’t connected to streams, lakes, rivers and oceans. Specifically, the revisions establish that protected waterways must be “navigable” or have a continuous water connection, making some types of wetlands vulnerable to development.

In New Jersey, property owners can’t fill, dredge or build on a wetland without a permit. Other states like Delaware have more limited wetland laws.

“Whether it’s water supply, whether it’s for irrigating crops, for people’s drinking water, we don’t have enough, and it’s getting more and more critical. At the same time, during storms we have too much water,” Tedesco said. “Whether it’s salt water or fresh water, wetlands really are the cornerstone to the whole system.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-jersey-coastal-salt-marshes-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 09:57:29.419655

“I’m much more concerned about damage that will happen rather than achieving anything new and good,” said Sarah Lynn Cunningham, co-founder and executive director of the Louisville Climate Action Network. “I feel more like we’re in a defensive posture to prevent regression.”

From conservative lawmakers worried about Kentucky’s energy industries to people like Cunningham fighting society-driven climate change, they all agree the biggest issue coming before the legislature in the new year will be what to do about the resource-intensive data centers tech companies are hungry to build as they invest in artificial intelligence.

But they say other proposals on energy and the environment are also likely to come up as the General Assembly begins work in January.

‘A pretty good record’

This year legislators will approve a new, two-year budget for the state government, and environmental advocates hope they’ll spend extra on conservation efforts.

A report from The Nature Conservancy compared Kentucky to 11 “peer states” and found it lags in estimated annual conservation funding. At about $2.4 million, the report said Kentucky fell $9.1 million behind the next-lowest contributor: Indiana, at $11.5 million.

Conservation projects can serve multiple purposes, from shoring up a town against future floods to opening up green spaces for recreation to shielding water resources needed by residents and businesses, said Nick Hart, water policy director for the Kentucky Waterways Alliance.

“There's data out there that shows that every $1 spent for conservation funding and flood resilience returns back to us threefold in economic development,” he said.

Senator Robby Mills, a Henderson Republican who chairs the Senate’s majority caucus, indicated conservative lawmakers are open to discussing how to better support conservation efforts.

“But I think we have a pretty good record on conservationism. And if opportunities availed itself, I wouldn't say that we would shy away from it. We’d look at it,” he said.

‘Aggressive assault’

In 2025, the legislature ended a decades-old tradition in Kentucky of giving state-level protections against pollution to basically all waters in the commonwealth.

Under a new law, Senate Bill 89, the state mostly follows the federal government’s lead on which waters to safeguard. The law’s Republican supporters said this will reduce unnecessary red tape burdening businesses.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced in November that it wants to reduce the types of waterways that qualify for Clean Water Act protection. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates less than 15% of Kentucky wetlands would stay shielded.

“I would like to think that this aggressive assault on the integrity of what remains of our wetlands would sort of spur some folks to revisit the fact that we’ve entirely laid ourselves bare,” said Michael Washburn, executive director of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance.

But Republican lawmakers likely aren’t interested in taking up that issue again, at least so soon after passing SB 89. Mills said he expects legislators and their staff to watch what happens with federal regulations over the next year.

Similarly, Senator Scott Madon, a Pineville Republican who was SB 89’s lead sponsor, said he isn’t interested in revisiting the law in 2026 and thinks Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration could do a better job implementing it.

He pointed to Beshear’s claim that the state required an extra $1.8 million annually for staff to review water permit renewals under the new rules.

“Well, we never did really understand what he needed 1.8 for,” Madon said.

Going nuclear

It’s a safe bet some Republican lawmakers’ interest in nuclear energy will persist.

Mills said he sees continued support of coal and other fossil fuels as a bridge to get Kentucky to a future that’s powered significantly by nuclear energy.

“If there were targeted investments that we could make as a legislature to help our fossil fuel plants continue to burn for another 10 or 15 years, those could be investments that you see,” he said.

Madon said he’s afraid a day is coming when enough coal won't be available. Kentucky must diversify its energy portfolio, like states that are mixing solar, wind, gas and other power sources.

“I'm not saying anything against coal. I just think we need some other avenues to go along with our coal,” he said.

PFAS, tires, invasives

Advocates from environmental groups listed off various legislative proposals they hope will gain momentum this year.

Hart of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance, for example, said the legislature ordered the state government to produce a report with recommendations on how to tackle the vehicle tires that litter streams. They expect it will lead to concrete policy proposals.

Lane Boldman, executive director of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, said she hopes lawmakers will advance legislation to create a working group on PFAS, the so-called “forever chemicals” leaked into environments worldwide, and require manufacturers to disclose details when they add PFAS to products.

She and other environmental advocates also say they’d like to see progress on proposals to fight the spread of invasive plant species and stop utilities from cutting power during extreme weather to customers with overdue bills.

They’re also wary of possible budget cuts to the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet and the Public Service Commission.

Both agencies historically have been understaffed, but their work is needed to meet obligations under U.S. environmental laws and take action when people break the rules on, say, pollution limits, said Audrey Ernstberger, an associate attorney with the Kentucky Resources Council.

“We want to make sure that these agencies continue to have reasonable amounts of funding to do their jobs,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4116845/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F11%2Fa9b31f9749878e9b24804b8f157a%2Fimg-4497.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 09:57:33.451000
