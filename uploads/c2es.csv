The project will cost nearly $100 million for retooling and add more than 900 jobs at the plant in suburban Detroit, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.
“As part of this announcement, we will move one model from Canada to the U.S.,” a Stellantis spokesperson said.
“Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a statement.
Stellantis said it would add 900 jobs in Toledo to make the truck there, and it plans to continue with investments in Toledo that it announced previously.","In Michigan, the Warren Truck Assembly Plant will make a new SUV, available as either a range-extended electric vehicle or a gasoline-powered model, starting in 2028, Stellantis said. The project will cost nearly $100 million for retooling and add more than 900 jobs at the plant in suburban Detroit, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson plant for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, reaffirming a commitment from January. Production of that vehicle is anticipated to launch in 2029. The UAW previously had expressed concern that Durango production would leave the U.S.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the Company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement. “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

Stellantis said it plans to reopen an Illinois assembly plant in in 2027, affirming an earlier commitment to do so. But instead of building a midsize Ram pickup, the plant, which has been offline since 2023, will make the Jeep Compass and Cherokee that were slated to be built outside the U.S.

The Ram pickup now will be assembled in Toledo, Ohio, starting in 2028.

“A year ago, Stellantis was on a fast-track to moving their U.S. operations out of the country,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “Their decision today proves that targeted auto tariffs can, in fact, bring back thousands of good union jobs to the U.S. Wall Street and supposed industry experts said this was impossible. But race to the bottom created by free trade is finally coming to an end.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement celebrating the Michigan investment, ""Over the last few years, Stellantis has expanded in Michigan, and we will continue working with them to make it easier to manufacture in Michigan by investing in workforce development, cutting red tape, incentivizing R&D, and increasing government efficiency.""

The news follows General Motors’ commitment in June to spend $4 billion to increase U.S. manufacturing.

Stellantis’ $13 billion total includes R&D spending and supplier costs. After Filosa became CEO in June, he set a “clear priority” for his team to grow the company in the U.S., where sales and profits had been declining.

“The only way we know to consistently grow in such a competitive market is to launch the right product with the right brands, the right tech and the right powertrain,” Filosa said. “So how we do that? First, we decided to put our customer at the center of everything we do. We actually started listening to him and her and to engage a lot our dealers. That’s how we came out with our growing plan.”

The product launches announced Oct. 14 “will be in addition to a regular cadence of 19 refreshed products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029,” Stellantis said.

The company plans to invest $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to produce the Cherokee and Compass for the U.S., with one nameplate starting in 2027 and the other in 2028. This will create about 3,300 new jobs.

Both nameplates were previously made in Belvidere, with the Compass moving to Mexico in 2016 and the Cherokee being discontinued when the plant was idled in 2023.

Jeep is reviving the Cherokee this fall as a hybrid built in Mexico.

When Belvidere reopens, Filosa said it will be the primary source of Cherokees and Compasses for the U.S. Stellantis no longer plans to make the redesigned Compass in Brampton, Ontario, after halting work to retool the Canadian plant in February.

“As part of this announcement, we will move one model from Canada to the U.S.,” a Stellantis spokesperson said. “We have been in Canada for over 100 years, and we are investing there. We are adding a third shift to the Windsor Assembly Plant to support increased demand of all versions of the Chrysler Pacifica and the new Sixpack-powered Dodge Charger Scat Pack and R/T models. Canada is very important to us. We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government.”

The move upset the Canadian auto union Unifor, which urged the government to help ensure jobs at the Brampton plant are not lost.

“Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a statement. “Stellantis cannot be allowed to renege on its commitments to Canadian workers, and governments cannot stand by while our jobs are shifted to the United States. Saving Brampton Assembly must now be this country’s top priority, sending a strong message to any corporation thinking they can take the same egregious actions.”

Nearly $400 million is going toward assembly of the new midsize pickup in Ohio, joining the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator. Stellantis said it would add 900 jobs in Toledo to make the truck there, and it plans to continue with investments in Toledo that it announced previously.

Stellantis also confirmed a January announcement to make upgrades at several Kokomo, Ind., plants for a new four-cylinder engine to be made starting in 2026. The automaker said it will add more than 100 jobs and invest more than $100 million “to ensure that the U.S. will be the manufacturing home of this strategic powertrain.”

“This is a phenomenal testament to the recent work that has been done to strengthen the company’s relationship with dealers, while strengthening its overall presence in U.S. sales and production,” said Michael Bettenhausen, chairman of the Stellantis National Dealer Council.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/SSTELLANTIS-MAIN_i_6_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:00:13.637579

Types of Geothermal Energy There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.
Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.","As energy use rises and the planet warms, you might have dreamed of an energy source that works 24/7, rain or shine, quietly powering homes, industries and even entire cities without the ups and downs of solar or wind — and with little contribution to climate change.

The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy — heat from the Earth itself — has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted $1.7 billion in public funding — compared with $2 billion for all of 2024, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.

A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10 percent of the electricity demand of the whole nation — and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs.

Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.

Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.

But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion, is not complete. When complete in 2028, the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground.

And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour, a price competitive with other renewable sources.

Types of Geothermal Energy

There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.

Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.

Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy, have operated for over a century, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production.

A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs.

Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just six or eight feet down — and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower.

These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient than air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments.

Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it.

Researchers are also finding new ways to use geothermal resources. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises.

Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.

Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable power in Texas, among other places.

And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as is happening in Iceland.

Geothermal Potential in the U.S. and Worldwide

Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity, mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4 percent of current U.S. energy production, but the amount of available energy is much larger, according to federal and international engineering assessments.

And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.

One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community, it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California.

Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells, which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment.

There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy.

Challenges and Trade-offs

Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.

Drilling is expensive, and conventional systems need specific geological conditions. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes.

Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation. But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9 percent of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere. And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption.

Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.

Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind — and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.

A look across its 142 square miles shows that it is still mired in poverty. Although it has probably leveled off, the city has lost a massive number of residents. It also has many abandoned houses that will remain indefinitely.

A small part of downtown has made a comeback, led by Rocket Companies founder Dan Gilbert, who has invested or brought hundreds of millions of dollars into the area. A portion of it has also been rebuilt by other companies. The most prominent example of this is Ford’s refurbishment of the Michigan Central Station. Ford spent $950 million on the project.

Ironically, very close by, the Renaissance Center—the tallest building in the city—was built largely due to efforts by Henry Ford II. General Motors bought the building and moved its headquarters there in the mid-1990s. The company is set to depart, leaving the huge building without a major tenant. All or parts of it may be demolished, which is a sign of how fragile Detroit’s downtown rebound really is.

Another part of Detroit’s comeback is a complex that houses the Detroit Lions and Detroit Tigers. In the same general development, Ford Field and Comerica Park sit next to one another.

Another section of downtown that has been extensively developed is around its casinos. These are the MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown Casino-Hotel, and MotorCity Casino Hotel. Among them, they bring tens of thousands of people to Detroit each year.

The Rest of the City

The demographics of the entire city are as bad as those of any major U.S. city. The poverty rate is over 31%. Median household income is under $40,000, or half the national average. The median home value is $106,000, which is about one-third the national median.

Detroit has been bleeding population since the 1950s. The 1950 Census showed Detroit’s population as 1,849,668. The figure for 2024 was 645,705, though that was up 1% from 2020. Detroit lost population in each decennial census from 1950 to 2020.

Federal standards, state bans and high-profile litigation are converging to create a challenging environment for businesses and policymakers.","PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” have been on the radar of regulators and industry for years, but the recent pace and scope of action mark a turning point.

Federal agencies are advancing the first national drinking water standards and expanding reporting and cleanup obligations, while the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision to list PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) opens the door to significant new liability.

State legislatures are moving even faster, adopting product bans, disclosure requirements and their own enforceable limits for drinking water. At the same time, courts are driving change through large-scale settlements with chemical manufacturers and water utilities, and insurers are narrowing coverage in response. For companies, utilities and policymakers, the combined effect is a regulatory and legal environment where PFAS risk is no longer theoretical but a pressing operational and financial challenge.

Federal Regulatory Developments

At the federal level, EPA and other agencies have accelerated PFAS controls. In April 2024, EPA adopted the first-ever national drinking water standards for PFAS, setting maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion and requiring controls on mixtures containing PFHxS, PFNA, GenX (HFPO-DA) and PFBS under a new “hazard index” approach. The rule is projected to protect roughly 100 million people. In May 2025, EPA announced it would retain the 4 ppt limits for PFOA and PFOS but reconsider the new limits for PFHxS, PFNA, GenX (HFPO-DA) and the mixed hazard index. EPA also announced the extension of the deadline for public water systems to comply with the PFOA and PFOS limits from 2029 to 2031, with a final rule expected in 2026. These changes reflect a more gradual federal approach even as states continue to set their own drinking water limits.

Beyond drinking water, EPA has been rolling out a range of other PFAS regulations that will impact industry. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the EPA finalized a rule in January 2024 that restricts companies from resuming production or use of more than 300 PFAS chemicals without first undergoing a full federal review. Later that year, in October 2023, the agency also issued a reporting rule requiring any company that has made or imported PFAS since 2011 to disclose detailed information about how those substances were used, how much was produced and how they were managed or disposed of. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), a federal database that tracks chemical emissions, has been expanded to include dozens more PFAS, closing loopholes that had previously allowed companies to omit small quantities. The EPA has also developed new testing methods to detect PFAS in water, soil and air, and has proposed adding nine PFAS to the list of hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs cleanup and waste disposal. Together, these steps reflect a broad federal effort to tighten oversight of PFAS production, reporting and cleanup.

Under CERCLA, the EPA took a major step in April 2024 by designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances. This decision, which became effective that July, means that releases of those chemicals can now trigger what’s known as Superfund liability—the federal government’s authority to require responsible parties to pay for or perform cleanup of contaminated sites. That liability can be strict and retroactive, meaning companies may be held responsible for pollution that occurred years ago. To ease concerns about fairness, the agency issued guidance saying it would focus enforcement on companies that significantly contributed to PFAS pollution rather than on landowners or small entities that were simply affected by it. Industry groups quickly sued, arguing that EPA went beyond its authority, but in September 2025 the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed it would defend the rule. The agency has also said it plans to create a broader framework for how additional PFAS might be listed in the future. Administrator Zeldin has acknowledged concerns about unintentionally penalizing property owners or farmers who inherited contaminated land and has asked Congress to clarify the limits of liability under the law.

Other federal agencies are acting as well. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has moved to eliminate PFAS in food packaging. In early 2024, it announced that all grease-proofing agents containing PFAS, used in paper wrappers, pizza boxes and similar products, will cease due to industry phaseout and FDA’s withdrawal of approvals. In January 2025, the agency withdrew existing food-contact approvals for those PFAS, effectively banning PFAS-based food wrappers and bags. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also taken steps, adapting programs to help farmers cope with PFAS exposure. For example, the Dairy Indemnity Payment Program now compensates producers for cows lost to PFAS contamination, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers cost-share assistance for PFAS testing of farm soil and water. These measures acknowledge the risk of PFAS leaching into crops and livestock.

State Legislative and Regulatory Trends

States remain the proving ground for PFAS controls. In the last two years, dozens of legislatures have enacted or considered bans, disclosure rules and mandates targeting PFAS in products and the environment. Comprehensive bans are emerging on major categories of PFAS use. California’s legislature in 2025 passed a bill phasing out intentional PFAS in consumer products, banning them in food packaging, children’s products, dental floss, cleaning products and ski wax by 2028, with cookware phased out by 2031. Illinois enacted a broad ban on PFAS in cookware, cosmetics, children’s products, personal care items, intimate apparel and food packaging, effective in 2026. Other states have targeted narrower sectors, banning PFAS in menstrual products or firefighting uniforms. Rhode Island has set a ban on PFAS in all firefighting gear beginning in 2027.

Disclosure mandates and reporting rules are also spreading. Illinois requires manufacturers of firefighting gear to report known PFAS uses and label products accordingly, with a full ban by 2027. Minnesota has a similar PFAS reporting law. Maine has enacted a law requiring public notification of PFAS levels in drinking water, and Delaware now requires the state to maintain a public PFAS information website and notify residents if utilities exceed thresholds.

Product restrictions and phaseouts continue to expand. Twenty states now ban PFAS in any paper food packaging, with more set to follow in 2027. States like Maine, Washington and New York have banned PFAS in children’s products, cosmetics and textiles, while cookware bans have been adopted in Minnesota, Colorado and Maine starting in 2025 and 2026. Vermont recently delayed its cookware ban to 2028 in response to industry concerns. Disclosure of PFAS-free certifications is also becoming common, with some states requiring sellers to obtain certificates of compliance for PFAS-free products.

Testing requirements are less uniform, but many states are adopting their own standards in addition to EPA rules. At least 20 states now have their own drinking water limits for one or more PFAS. New York passed legislation tightening its PFOA and PFOS limits to 4 ppt and adding a 10 ppt limit for other PFAS, while Pennsylvania and Vermont are considering even stricter standards. Some states now require utilities to test private wells in known contaminated areas. The result is a patchwork of testing and compliance requirements that continue to evolve.

Litigation and Settlements

PFAS litigation continues at a rapid pace, with settlements between chemical companies and public water utilities now reaching into the billions. In May 2024, Chemours agreed to pay $316.5 million to settle claims by a group of utilities over firefighting foam contamination. Later that year, Johnson Controls agreed to pay $750 million to resolve lawsuits brought by water systems across eight states. The largest settlement thus far came from 3M, which in 2023 agreed to pay up to $10.3 billion to settle claims from thousands of public water suppliers that alleged widespread PFAS contamination. Around the same time, Chemours, Corteva and DuPont jointly agreed to a separate $1.19 billion settlement covering similar claims. Most recently, in summer 2025, New Jersey announced a proposed $875 million settlement with DuPont, Chemours and Corteva to resolve decades of contamination within the state.

New lawsuits continue to emerge from states, municipalities and individual plaintiffs. More than 30 state attorneys general have sued PFAS manufacturers, while private and class action cases are expanding to include claims of health impacts and property damage. Courts are testing a range of legal theories, from nuisance and negligence to product liability and violations under federal and state hazardous waste laws. At the same time, insurers are tightening their policies by adding PFAS exclusions, leaving companies with fewer options for coverage and forcing many to consider self-insurance or alternative risk strategies.

Industry-Specific Impacts

PFAS rules are reshaping operations across multiple sectors. Manufacturers, especially chemical producers and consumer goods companies, face growing costs and liability risks. Many are phasing out PFAS, auditing supply chains and preparing for national retailers to demand PFAS-free certifications. Cookware, textiles, cosmetics and cleaning products are all facing state-level bans that will accelerate reformulation.

In food and beverage, the concern centers on packaging and contamination. FDA’s elimination of PFAS greaseproof paper has already forced restaurant chains, grocers and packaging suppliers to shift to alternatives. State bans are further pushing national food companies to reformulate packaging to comply with a patchwork of state laws. Beyond packaging, farmers and food producers are facing contamination risks in dairy, crops and livestock, prompting recalls and disruptions.

Public water systems must now test for PFAS under federal rules and upgrade treatment to meet MCLs. These upgrades will be costly and are already spurring litigation against PFAS manufacturers. Wastewater utilities are also grappling with biosolids contaminated by PFAS, in some cases halting land application programs entirely.

The aerospace and defense sector is having to address PFAS largely through firefighting foams and legacy contamination. The Department of Defense (DOD) has identified nearly 600 sites with PFAS releases and is working on a phased transition to PFAS-free foams. However, many of those cleanup efforts have been delayed into the 2030s, raising concerns among local communities. Defense contractors and DOD itself are also facing liability as potential responsible parties under CERCLA.

Looking Ahead

The PFAS landscape will remain dynamic through the next several years with an increased emphasis on remediation. EPA is expected to finalize a compliance extension for drinking water standards while reconsidering rules for additional PFAS. The CERCLA litigation could affect the scope of Superfund liability. At the state level, legislative activity is accelerating, with new bans and disclosure laws set to take effect in 2026 and beyond.

For clients, the key risks to monitor include rising compliance costs for testing and treatment, the spread of product bans and the growth of litigation targeting both manufacturers and downstream users. Insurers are moving quickly to exclude PFAS claims, leaving companies more exposed. Supply chains are tightening as major producers exit PFAS markets, and regulators continue to add compounds to their lists of concern.

In short, PFAS regulation has entered a new phase. Federal standards, state bans and high-profile litigation are converging to create a challenging environment for businesses and policymakers. Brownstein is tracking PFAS legislation and regulations on the federal level and across all 50 states. We can assist companies in monitoring this ever-changing landscape as companies review exposure risks, audit supply chains and begin planning now for a regulatory environment in which PFAS risk is unavoidable.

“It’s embedded into the operations, processes and decision making at each facility, project and program,” said Driscoll in remarks made in Washington, D.C., at the Public Utilities Fortnightly’s annual Fortnightly Top Innovators 2025 event.

An example of NYPA innovation is its Integrated Smart Operations Center, he noted. NYPA has deployed across the state more than 150,000 sensors “that are all fed into our office in White Plains and we use this tool as an asset” monitoring NYPA’s digital twin function.

“We’ve created a digital twin that shows what proper operations of all of our fleet look like – both transmission and generation – and then we compare that to real time sensor data,” he said. “We have actually spotted incidences where we’ve avoided having to take a forced outage and we’ve actually started to track how much money we’ve been saving through those sensor deployments and spotting through that digital twin effort” if there are irregularities in the operation of NYPA’s system.

Another example of NYPA innovation is its Advanced Grid Innovation Laboratory for Energy, or AGILe. At the lab, NYPA personnel utilize another digital twin technology to create a replica of the power system.

“We’ve modeled the entire grid all the way down to the distribution level and that means we can simulate extreme weather events, test renewable integration strategies – plug in a wind farm or solar farm in different parts of the state,” he said.

“We can optimize operations in a safe, controlled environment, all before making changes in the real world,” Driscoll said.

“For example, we can study the effects of adding a wind farm off the coast of Long Island or it could help us” in deciding where NYPA may site a nuclear power plant or plants, “depending upon whether we go with an SMR technology or an AP1000.”

In addition, “we can and have also simulated cyberattacks on the New York grid and we can test the latest cyber intrusion technologies to assess their effectiveness on our system.”

Outside the lab, “innovation is driving our approach to safety on the ground, from Niagara Falls to New York City. At our assets across the state we deploy drones and robotics for inspections – and by that we’re not just saving costs, we’re keeping workers safe, risking the machine and not the worker while gathering richer data to manage our assets.”

With respect to advanced nuclear power, he noted that NYPA is exploring next generation reactors “designed for enhanced safety and efficiency with smaller footprints, faster construction times and lower waste.”

The credits were enhanced and extended during the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, and then again during the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Professor Stavick said.

Lawmakers wanted to try and stimulate the economy and take some of the burden off of people who may have lost work, Stavick said.

The enhanced credits have always been temporary, but now, they're a main point of contention between Republicans and Democrats as the country enters the third week of a government shutdown.

Republicans want to cut back on how much the federal government is spending on these credits, Stavick said.

""The extra costs that had been subsidized by the federal government is now coming out of the pockets of households,"" he said.

Typically, families between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line use these credits. There is actually no income cap to use the credits, Stavick said, but most people who make more than that use their employer's insurance, or aren't using ACA health care, he added.

For example, a family of four with a household income of $65,000 a year sits at about 200% of the federal poverty line.

With the enhanced credits, they currently pay about $100 a month for their family. Without the credit, they'd pay about $350 a month for their family.

""The credits will be structured differently [if they expire],"" Stavick said. ""It will revert back to the pre-American Rescue Plan era.""

If someone makes near 100% of the federal poverty line, or about $20,000 a year--right now, they pay nothing for healthcare.

If the credits expire, they'd pay about 2% of their monthly income, or about $30 a month.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the existing enhanced credit system would cost about $350 billion more over the next 10 years than the status quo credit system.",https://media.wbir.com/assets/WBIR/images/2872015e-266f-45c8-85df-e1df9da0045d/20251014T213553/2872015e-266f-45c8-85df-e1df9da0045d_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:59:57.325574

(Reuters) -Global sales of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 26% in September from a year ago to a record 2.1 million units, driven by strong demand in China and a late U.S. tax-credit rush, market research firm Rho Motion said on Wednesday.

China accounted for about two-thirds of global sales with about 1.3 million units, while North America also hit a record as U.S. buyers moved to secure incentives before they expired, said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

China is the world’s biggest car market and accounts for more than half of global EV sales, which in Rho Motion’s data include battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

September, typically China’s busiest month for car buying, saw sales rise as shoppers looked to make the most of trade-in subsidies before some regions started phasing them out.

U.S. demand reflected a surge as buyers rushed to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit, although demand is expected to decline sharply in the fourth quarter “as both consumers and businesses lose access to the federal incentives that have underpinned EV purchases”, Rho Motion said.

Europe also hit a new high, helped by incentives in Germany and strong demand in Britain, while Tesla’s rollout of a lower-cost Model Y in Europe is expected to further intensify competition in coming months.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global sales of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose 26% to a record 2.1 million units in September, Rho Motion data showed.

Chinese sales rose to about 1.3 million vehicles. European sales jumped 36% to 427,541 units, while North American sales climbed 66% to about 215,000. Sales in the rest of the world jumped 48% to 153,594 vehicles.

KEY QUOTE

“With the federal incentive gone, U.S. demand is expected to drop sharply in the final quarter of the year,” Lester said.

Some automakers such as General Motors and Hyundai are trying to soften the blow by offering discounts or tapping dealer inventories, but overall production is being scaled back, he added.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Our climate is changing faster than ever. Sea levels are rising, oceans are heating up, and droughts are becoming more extreme—threatening crops, wildlife, and freshwater supplies. From polar bears in the Arctic to sea turtles off Africa’s coasts, life everywhere is feeling the impact. These changes threaten not only nature but also the communities and livelihoods that depend on it.

What’s at stake?

The Amazon’s vast forests and rivers keep soils healthy, crops growing, and wildlife thriving. But as climate change dries forests and disrupts rainfall, this delicate balance is unraveling—putting communities, biodiversity, and the future of the forest itself at risk. Urgent and immediate action is now needed to ensure its conservation.

The Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere else in the world, melting the ice that regulates our climate. What happens here threatens not only Arctic ecosystems, but will shape weather, seas, and communities around the world. This region must be protected to preserve its fragile ecosystems and limit dangerous global impacts.

Climate change is fueling a record number of increasingly extreme weather events and disasters. From powerful storms to devastating floods and intense heatwaves, these events are putting people’s lives and livelihoods at growing risk. By preparing now, we can protect both communities and the environments they depend on.

“During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada,” they said.

Esmeralda 7 is set to be the largest solar project in the U.S. by capacity. The project’s National Environmental Policy Act status is listed as canceled on the Bureau of Land Management’s website. In a Tuesday email, the spokesperson said the BLM had not canceled the project.

“During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada,” they said. “Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

According to a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project from July of last year, the individual projects are: Lone Mountain Solar, Nivloc Solar, Smoky Valley Solar, Red Ridge 1 Solar, Red Ridge 2 Solar, Esmeralda Energy Center and Gold Dust Solar, which “would be geographically contiguous and encompass approximately 62,300 acres of BLM-administered lands approximately 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada.”

Developers of the seven projects include Invenergy, Avantus, and NextEra. A spokesperson for NextEra told The Guardian, “We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management.” All of the projects have pending right-of-way applications before the Bureau of Land Management, the draft PEIS said.

As the project’s previous NEPA review process has been canceled, it’s unclear how long it will now take each project to secure approvals. The original draft PEIS said that the timelines for construction “would vary by project with estimates of 18 to 36 months,” and that “the timing of project approvals and the availability of the construction contractors and workforce would also differ by project. It is assumed that full buildout of all projects could be completed within 5 years from the Record of Decision for the PEIS/[Resource Management Plan Amendment].”

The Environmental Defense Fund criticized Interior’s decision to cancel the project’s review, calling it “yet another example of how the Trump administration is taking a two-tiered approach to energy permitting: polluting, expensive fossil fuels get ‘concierge, white glove service,’ while cheap renewables and storage get freezes, delays and cancellations.”

Assessing each project individually fits with an overall trend in the Trump administration’s treatment of renewable energy projects sited on federal land. Individual offshore wind projects have received stop work orders from the administration, or seen federal approvals revoked.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/7A4VgF5wKht2vFZtN1JNbqGX9PtCBsSYiD0yKDxXkFA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzI1OTgyNjY5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-14 20:01:58.276588

Attendees from across Texas are at the summit to receive new data on groundwater levels and learn about techniques that cities, businesses, and homeowners can use to help recycle and conserve water.

“What are you doing as a lawmaker to protect our water resources, especially in the Texas Panhandle?”

“Yeah, so we pull from an aquifer that is depleting. Everybody knows it, the other states that are pulling from it know it,” said Charles Perry, state senator, Texas District 28. “We have to learn how to use that water to the max.”

The state of Texas, on average, currently uses around 17 million acre-feet of water as the population continues to grow and as more industry comes to the Lone Star State, the amount of water we use will only increase.

“So, Texas is growing very rapidly, and we got these new demands for water,” said Dr. Robert Mace, executive director for Meadows Center for Water & Environment. “Data centers are a big one in this area. We’re pumping the Ogallala Aquifer about six times the rate as it's refilling back up and so we are in a depleting resource out here on the High Plains.”

“There is a pathway to bringing more water to this region, and if you get that water to Lubbock and or to Amarillo, and those guys are using options, and that will quit depleting the aquifer by the municipal use,” said Perry. “If we can mitigate municipal use growing at that level and then stabilize it by not using it, then farmers will have more water going forward.”

Greenbaum Rowe Smith & Davis LLP has bolstered two key practice areas with the addition of John P. Gray, a former official with two prominent state agencies.

Gray, who held significant roles with both the Department of Environmental Protection and NJ Transit, joins the law firm as a partner in its environmental and energy and renewable resources groups. He does so with nearly 24 years of experience, which he’ll use to assist Greenbaum’s clients in navigating the complexities of environmental and agency approvals for development projects, having honed his skills in regulatory compliance and strategic planning prior to entering private practice.

“After two decades of delivering critical environmental and construction guidance in public service roles, I’m eager to take on new challenges by working with Greenbaum’s amazing team to help our clients tackle their legal challenges and successfully meet their business goals,” Gray said. “In a constantly changing landscape of complex regulations, I look forward to delivering solutions that assist clients with meeting their evolving needs.”

Gray’s work with DEP included leading efforts in permitting complex projects such as electric generation, major remediation and large-scale infrastructure, Greenbaum said, noting that he also served as a legislative liaison on regulatory matters and constituent and policy formulation issues. With NJ Transit, he managed legal services, oversaw compliance with federal and state funding requirements and responded to audits and inquiries from agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice.

Glass Lewis, proxy advisor, ends benchmark recommendations under pressure

Glass Lewis, a major proxy adviser, will stop offering its ""benchmark voting"" recommendations in 2027. Instead they will provide a new set of options to clients. Glass Lewis sent a paper stating that there is a growing divide between the U.S. investors and Europeans in regards to issues such as fiduciary duties and sustainability. A spokesperson for the company said that the change in policy was also indirectly the result of criticisms the firm received from Republican politicians in the United States. The spokesperson stated that ""the whole geopolitical climate is connected to this."" Glass Lewis, and its rival Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), have come under pressure by politicians who are aligned with corporate management, as topics such as executive pay and climate politics have gained more attention at annual corporate meetings. In Texas, for example, two firms are under investigation by the Republican Attorney General of the state over whether or not they have violated consumer protection laws, including rules about disclosing important facts. The two companies deny any wrongdoing and have won separate preliminary injunctions that block a new state statute that would have forced them to inform clients of their advice regarding environmental, social, and governance issues, which does not only serve the financial interests of shareholders. Glass Lewis announced in its paper published on Tuesday that it will use AI to ""move away from a one size fits all approach to a highly customizable, client-centric Framework."" Glass Lewis will allow clients to create their own voting frameworks and will provide research that supports various voting perspectives, including those focused management views, governance, or sustainability priorities. A spokesperson for ISS said that it will continue to adhere to its benchmark policy, but also noted that it has introduced new products and services for investors. These include research which does not contain voting recommendations. Aaron Bertinetti is the CEO of Investor Engagement in North America at Computershare. This business includes shareholder outreach as well as investor relations. He expects that both functions will be more important, especially when proxy advisor recommendations are smaller. In the past, companies were able to easily identify investors that they should be trying to influence. Bertinetti stated that ""now the influence has become dispersed, and is much more difficult to track.""

Doctors without Borders closes Haiti's emergency clinic as a 'last-resort'

Doctors without Borders announced on Tuesday that it will close an emergency clinic located in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital city. The closure is due to the violent clashes which have been ongoing in the area and are a threat to the safety of both staff and patients. MSF has been suspending operations at the Turgeau health clinic, which is located near an high school and several government ministries, ever since March. MSF reported that its vehicles, which were clearly marked, were targeted by gunfire 15 times during the evacuation. Why it's important Haiti has been in a conflict for years with armed groups that have taken control of much of its capital. This has limited the supply of goods, services, and the safe movement of three million residents of the metropolitan area. Many aid groups have left or suspended operations in Haiti due to the violence, limiting their options at a time when the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse. KEY QUOTE MSF's Chief of Mission in Haiti Jean-Marc Biquet stated in a press release that the area around the Port-au-Prince center has been a scene of regular violence for several weeks. The clinic's building was also hit by bullets several times. ""MSF regrets the difficult decision that was made as a final resort. The closure will have a major impact on the access to healthcare of a population that is already suffering from violence, insecurity and precarious living situations. CONTEXT MSF stated that it was waiting for the signing of the memorandum-of-understanding which would establish a humanitarian corridor between Carrefour and the capital before it resumed medical activities between Port-au-Prince's suburb and the downtown. The Turgeau clinic's staff has reported several attacks. One incident occurred in November last year when an ambulance stopped and its staff was threatened. Patients were also killed. Another involved a patient being forcibly taken out of an ambulance, then shot, just a few feet away from the Turgeau Clinic. By the Numbers According to the World Health Organization and the United Nations, only 13% of 254 Haitian hospitals assessed in June were fully operational. Just 5% of 93 systems assessed in the Port-au-Prince metropolis were fully functional.

US stocks finish mixed; gold surges amid positive IMF forecast and trade tensions

Wall Street ended Tuesday with mixed results and gold reached a new record high, as investors took into account the positive economic outlook from the International Monetary Fund Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Chair, against a resurgence of U.S.-China Trade Tensions The stock market lost momentum in the late session following U.S. president Donald Trump He posted on social media about his decision. Trade ties can be cut off The Dow recovered from an early sell-off and managed to make modest gains. Crude prices dropped, and the benchmark U.S. Treasury Yields eased. The S&P and Nasdaq ended the session in the negative. Powell stated in a Tuesday speech that the U.S. overall economy ""may have a firmer trajectory than anticipated."" He also warned that there is no ""risk-free policy path as we navigate between the tensions between our employment goals and inflation targets."" This echoes an IMF report that raised its global outlook for growth as the shocks from tariffs and financial conditions were less severe than expected. The IMF, however, warned that a trade war between two of the largest economies in the world could have a significant impact on output. Peter Cardillo is the chief market economist of Spartan Capital Securities, based in New York. Tuesday, the U.S. began charging China tit-fortat port charges. The bilateral trade tensions that have roiled the world markets in this year erupted late last week when China tightened its controls on rare earth exports. Trump responded by threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese imports up to triple digits. Bank Earnings Kick Off Earnings Season Upbeat quarterly results by high-profile financial companies including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs as well as Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup kicked off the third-quarter earning season. Cardillo said that if the banks are any guide, this will likely be a good earning season. Cardillo added, ""That is another factor that supports the recent highs in the market.""

A trade group wants to prohibit the export of scrap aluminium cans to China

A trade group representing aluminum industry demanded on Tuesday a ban on U.S. imports of used beverage containers to China in order to support American productions of cars, fighter planes, tanks, and satellites. The Aluminum Association stated that the United States exports more than 2,000,000 tons of aluminum scrap each year while consuming between 5 and 6 million tons. The group demanded an immediate ban on the export of used beverage containers outside North America for national security reasons, stating that much of U.S. waste flows to China, where it is processed before being shipped back to North America as finished products. The group stated that the U.S. Aluminum industry faces an annual supply gap of approximately 4 million metric tonnes of raw aluminum. They also said it would take many years to become self-sufficient, as well as billions of dollars in addition to accessing a large amount of affordable energy. Nearly half of the scrap aluminum exported by the United States is recycled. The association stated that this is especially concerning because the demand for aluminum in important areas such as cars, planes, and packaging has been growing. In June, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on aluminum metal imported to the United States. Canada imports two-thirds the total amount of primary aluminum used in the United States each year. The Commerce Department announced in August that it would be increasing steel and aluminum tariffs for more than 400 products, including auto parts worth $240 billion annually. These parts include electrical steel and automotive exhaust systems needed for electric vehicles, as well as bus components. The U.S. tariffs do not only apply to steel and aluminium, but also to many 'derivatives' made from these metals. (Reporting and editing by Chris Reese, Chizu Nomiyama)

U.S. president Donald Trump responded by threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese products into triple digits. The third quarter earnings season kicked off with positive quarterly results from high profile financial firms such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup also reported good results. Cardillo said that if the banks are any guide, this will likely be a good earning season. This is another factor that supports the recent highs in the market.

Russian official: Work to restore connection to Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant begins this week

On Tuesday, a Russian official announced that the restoration of external power to Zaporizhzhia's nuclear power plant in Russia will begin this week. The station has been operating on diesel generators since it was shut down for three weeks. In the first few weeks of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia Plant. Both sides have accused each other of military actions that led to the collapse of the external line on July 23, 2022. Mikhail Ulyanov is Russia's permanent representative at international organizations in Vienna. He told Russian state news agency RIA that ""active preparations are currently underway."" We expect that the repair work will begin on both transmission lines by the end of the week. Ulyanov stated that in order to carry out the repairs, it is ""essential to agree on local ceasefires in the areas where the work will be carried out"". The Vienna-based U.N. Nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly called for both sides to refrain form actions that compromise nuclear safety. The plant is Europe's biggest with six reactors. It produces no electricity right now, but it needs to produce power in order to keep the fuel cool inside and avoid any possible meltdown. Rafael Grossi, Director General of the IAEA, said that the diesel generators provide the needed power and has worked with both sides to restore the external links. Ukraine's Foreign Minister accused Russia of intentionally severing an external power line at the station to connect it to Moscow's grid. This month, a top Russian diplomat denied that Russia has any intention to restart the plant. (Reporting and Editing by Lisa Shumaker).

Gold as a safe-haven reaches record highs above $4,100/oz due to Fed rate cuts and trade worries

The gold price surpassed the $4,100 mark on Tuesday. This was boosted by the expectation of a rate reduction this month by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and by investors fleeing to safety following a resurgence in trade tensions with Beijing. As of 1:50 pm, spot gold was up 0.9% at $4,145.85 an ounce. ET (1750 GMT) after reaching a record-high of $4,179.48 in earlier session. U.S. Gold Futures for December Delivery gained 0.7% and settled at $4,163.40. Metal prices have risen by 57% in the past year. On Monday, they broke the $4,100 barrier. The rally was driven by a number of factors including geopolitical uncertainty, the expectation of U.S. rate cuts, central bank purchases and strong ETF inflows. Bank of America analysts and Societe Generale see gold at $5,000/oz by 2026. The uptick in U.S. - China trade tensions, ongoing government shutdown and expectations of more Fed easing all support gold, said Peter Grant. Grant said that U.S. president Donald Trump's threat to impose 100% duties on Chinese products, the roll-out of tit for tat port charges by both of the world's largest economies, and a macro-trend of de-dollarization, could push gold up to $5,000/oz in mid-next-year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on Monday that Trump will meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month in South Korea. Gold that does not yield tends to perform well in low interest rate environments. The markets are expecting a 25 basis-point cut in the Fed's rate this month. This will be followed by another reduction of 25 basis points in December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated during his speech to the National Association for Business Economics' annual meeting that ""based on the data we have, it seems fair to say the outlook for unemployment and inflation has not changed much since the September meeting four week ago."" Spot silver, buoyed up by the same factors that drive gold and tightness on the spot market, reached a record high at $53.60/oz, before retracing 0.9%, to $51.86.

“This system is secure, efficient and user-friendly — exactly the kind of innovation that helps both our stakeholders and our staff work smarter.” For fiscal year 2024-25, the state collected $13.3 million in waste tire fees.
Earlier this year, LDEQ began offering $20,000 grants to local governments to help with tire recycling and tackling the widespread problem of illegal tire dumping.","Louisiana has launched an online portal for businesses that generate waste tires and collect fees for the state to recycle them.

Auto dealers, tire shops and others who sell cars or tires can now submit their monthly reports and fee payments through a secure digital portal on the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality website, according to a news release the agency released Tuesday.

Whenever someone buys new tires or a new vehicle with tires, a charge is added in the form of a waste tire cleanup and recycling fee. The fee ranges from $2.25 per tire for standard sized wheels on passenger vehicles and pickup trucks, $5 for medium truck tires and $10 for off-road tires. All tire dealers and new car dealers in Louisiana are required by law to collect the fees from their customers at the point of sale and then forward them to the state Treasury at the end of every month.

Using the portal carries its own convenience fee of $2.50 per payment, and credit card transactions carry an additional 2.5% fee.

LDEQ officials said the portal saw strong participation in September, its first full month in use. Of 2,060 notices successfully sent to waste tire generators, 483 users submitted their reports through the portal, the agency said.

“The response from users in the first month has been extremely positive,” LDEQ Undersecretary Theresa Delafosse said in the release. “This system is secure, efficient and user-friendly — exactly the kind of innovation that helps both our stakeholders and our staff work smarter.”

For fiscal year 2024-25, the state collected $13.3 million in waste tire fees. The state uses the money to recycle used tires, an effort that poses technological and environmental challenges because of the complex designs of modern tires with layers of rubber, plastic, fabric and metal. Shredding tires releases chemicals and microplastics that are harmful to the environment and pose health risks to humans, according to LDEQ. Additionally, the presence of steel belts in tires complicates the recycling process, requiring specialized equipment to separate the layers.

Earlier this year, LDEQ began offering $20,000 grants to local governments to help with tire recycling and tackling the widespread problem of illegal tire dumping. In September, the pilot program awarded the grants to six local governments: the parishes of Iberville, Lafourche, Ouachita and Terrebonne and the cities of Gretna and West Monroe.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8557.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:03:37.185429

Iowa Environmental Council, Environmental Law & Policy Center and Food & Water Watch, the groups that penned the letter to EPA, also obtained records, via a public information request, on communications between DNR and EPA.
The environmental groups allege any additional information, including explanation from DNR, occurred in an “undocumented oral conversation” which was referenced in an obtained email.
Michael Schmidt, general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council said the decision “lacks transparency” and was “based on outdated” information.
The environmental groups argued the nitrate standard used does not apply solely to chronic effects.","Environmental groups penned a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency urging the federal agency to maintain its previously rescinded ruling that seven segments of Iowa rivers were impaired due to nitrate concentrations.

The environmental groups said EPA’s decision to delist these segments was “inconsistent” with the law, failed to hold polluters accountable and would lead to increased regulatory costs for water treatment in Iowa.

The decision from EPA followed a summer with near-record high nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers near Des Moines and the first-ever lawn watering ban from Central Iowa Water Works on account of the high nitrate concentrations, coupled with summer water demand.

Dani Replogle, staff attorney for the environmental group Food & Water Watch, called the EPA decision “baseless” and said it “does not inspire confidence in the federal agency meant to safeguard clean water and protect our health.”

“The data is clearer than ever that Iowa waterways are overwhelmed with persistent, toxic nitrate contamination,” Replogle said in a statement. “Iowans need more clean water protections — not less.”

Background

EPA ruled in January that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources needed to add seven river segments to its 2024 list of impaired water segments. This decision, which EPA said was due to the high levels of nitrate and “nitrate plus nitrite,” another form of combined nitrogen similar to nitrate, in the segments, was rescinded by EPA in July.

EPA said in their letter changing the decision that it is seeking additional information from DNR to determine “whether ‘good cause’ exists to not include the seven referenced waters.”

The original decision was opposed by DNR, with DNR’s executive director Kayla Lyon arguing the agency was holding Iowa’s department to “a very high standard.” DNR argued the designation would yield higher costs and greater regulatory oversight associated with the designation.

The impaired segments, on the Cedar, Des Moines, Raccoon, Iowa and South Skunk rivers, serve as drinking water sources for several municipalities including Des Moines, Iowa City and Cedar Rapids.

EPA holds that concentrations of nitrate and nitrite above 10 milligrams per liter in drinking water can lead to shortness of breath, blue-baby syndrome or even death in infants under the age of 6 months. Other research indicates long-term exposure to nitrate in drinking water is linked to certain types of cancer.

According to the EPA’s letter from July, announcing the recission of the impaired water segments, DNR did not list the segments in its impaired list because it applied standards for nitrate that “solely protect against chronic effects” while EPA applied standards that apply to both chronic and acute effects of nitrate.

Per EPA’s letter, this information was made clear in May 2025 when DNR submitted additional information to EPA explaining why the segments do not need an impairment listing.

Iowa Environmental Council, Environmental Law & Policy Center and Food & Water Watch, the groups that penned the letter to EPA, also obtained records, via a public information request, on communications between DNR and EPA. Per the records request, the documents submitted were DNR’s 2001 water quality standards document and EPA’s subsequent approval of the standards.

The groups allege these documents, being more than 20 years old, were already submitted to EPA. The environmental groups allege any additional information, including explanation from DNR, occurred in an “undocumented oral conversation” which was referenced in an obtained email.

The environmental groups, in their letter, argue these actions were “outside the process contemplated” in the Clean Water Act, which allows for a change to impaired water lists when EPA requests additional documents, and for public comment.

Michael Schmidt, general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council said the decision “lacks transparency” and was “based on outdated” information.

“EPA’s action undermines the public process defined in federal regulations and limits public transparency,” Schmidt said in a statement.

An EPA spokesperson said in a statement that DNR’s impaired waters list for 2024 made use of data from 2020-2022.

“IDNR is in the process of compiling and assessing water quality data from 2022-2024 and is expected to public notice its draft 2026 list early next year, which will include an assessment of these same seven water segments,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Concurrently, EPA will be working with IDNR to understand and resolve the issues forming the basis for EPA’s reconsideration of its 2024 decision.”

The spokesperson said it is working with DNR in the “spirit of cooperative federalism” and using “the latest information” to ensure water quality standards are “followed and upheld.”

“EPA has been tracking the levels of nitrate and is ensuring that all of the information and data collected by the cities, universities, and other groups is provided to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) for evaluation,” the spokesperson said.

Acute vs chronic

DNR argued its application of nitrate parameters pertained to chronic effects, which is why the department chose not to list the seven segments. The environmental groups argued the nitrate standard used does not apply solely to chronic effects.

The letter from environmental groups argued a symptom like blue-baby syndrome is an acute, rather than chronic, health outcome and is prevented by the EPA via the maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs, adopted under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The letter alleges the cited 2001 water quality standards from DNR incorporated these MCLs “as the water quality standard.”

A spokesperson for DNR declined to comment on the environmental groups’ letter and their position against the department’s reasoning.

In public comments to EPA’s original action, DNR director Lyon said the federal agency’s decision was incorrect because nitrate is not a “toxic pollutant.” The letter countered this argument by saying EPA’s toxic pollutant list outdated.

The letter said “overlooking the acute consequences” of high nitrate is inconsistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Environmental groups also cited Iowa Code for water quality standards and argued the “narrative” standards for surface water prohibit “toxic pollutants in toxic amounts.”

The referenced state standards note that substances toxic to humans, or “detrimental to treatment process” must have limited concentrations in surface water.

Water treatment facilities are responsible for keeping contaminants, like nitrate, within legal limits for drinking water. In Des Moines, where the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers were both elevated above 10 mg/L for nearly 70 days this summer, water treatment facilities were forced to run costly nitrate removal systems for more than 110 days this summer.

Environmental groups via the letter, said removing the segments from the impaired list “fails to address the causes” of pollution and “unfairly burdens” water treatment facilities.

Leadership from Des Moines Water Works echoed this sentiment following EPA’s delisting decision. They said in a news release that the decision did not align with financial and operational realities the utility faced in providing clean drinking water to the city.

Once a water segment is listed as impaired, EPA and DNR develop water quality improvement plans, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load or TMDLs, that require reductions to the known pollutant.

“Drinking water issues across the state, from western Iowa to the waters removed from the list by EPA, demonstrate the necessity for further action to address pollution in drinking water sources,” the letter said.

Iowa Environmental Council Water Program Director Colleen Fowle said EPA’s decision holds that the waterways in question meet safe drinking water standards, which she said is an “unjustified and dangerous” claim.

“Removing the impairment at the same time Central Iowa had to implement unprecedented water use restrictions made no sense,” Fowle said in the statement. “EPA’s action fails to put the onus on the polluters to adopt practices that will actually fix the problem.”

The environmental groups called for EPA to restore the impaired waters designation and consider their stated concerns as the agency reevaluates Iowa’s impaired waters list.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Raccoon-River-10.2-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 19:02:12.767704

To some of those present at Tuesday’s rally, those moves represented a backslide on Trump’s promises to support coal workers.
Trump is a vocal ally of the coal industry and has taken steps to boost production of the fuel in his first months in office.
“President Trump loves to use coal miners as political props.
But what he really digs is coal industry profits.","Coal miners, their family members and union representatives rallied outside of the U.S. Department of Labor’s headquarters in Washington on Tuesday morning, urging the Trump administration to enforce a rule that was meant to protect miners from serious health complications but has been on hold for months.

The rally, which included members of the National Black Lung Association and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), sought to highlight how lax industry standards for exposure to dangerous substances have impacted workers, and demand the government move forward with stricter protections.

A new Biden-era rule, which went into effect in June 2024, was meant to limit miners’ exposure to silica dust, which is released during the mining process. Those tiny silica particles can cause dangerous and irreversible damage to miners’ health, including black lung, silicosis, lung cancer and other diseases.

“If we don’t [enforce the rule], this is just going to be an earlier death sentence for our miners,” said Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association. “28 years old, 30, 35 years old and passing away—that shouldn’t be.”

The rule requires mining companies to lower exposure limits for silica to half the previously permitted amount. It also requires mine operators to monitor workers’ exposures to silica dust, compel them to provide periodic health examinations at no cost to miners and update standards for respiratory protection.

For Robinson and many of the attendees, the fight is personal. Robinson’s husband was diagnosed with black lung at 47 years old and is now “totally disabled,” Robinson said. Some attendees at the rally carried portable oxygen machines, while others held up pictures of loved ones who had died from the disease.

Black lung has been on the rise in the past 20 years, despite previously having been on the decline since the 1970s. In central Appalachia, the disease now affects one in five miners with 25 years of mining experience, according to the UMWA.

Coal mines were originally required to comply with the new rule by April 14, 2025. However, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) pushed back that deadline by four months just days before it was set to be implemented, citing the administration’s restructuring of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as the reason for the pause.

“Given the unforeseen NIOSH restructuring, and other technical reasons, MSHA offers this four-month temporary pause to provide time for operators to secure necessary equipment and otherwise come into compliance,” MSHA said at the time.

Legal challenges filed by industry groups, including the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association (NSSGA) and the National Mining Association (NMA), prompted the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to issue a temporary stay halting enforcement of the rule.

In a statement, NMA spokesperson Ashley Burke said that the association is “absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,” but that the rule “needs to allow for the use of administrative controls and personal protective equipment for compliance with the standard to supplement and enhance engineering controls.”

“The MSHA rule must align with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s silica rule on methods of compliance,” Burke said, adding that OSHA “has adopted a strict but workable approach to achieve these same silica levels; we are asking for consistency across government.”

Critics have said that those measures—such as rotating shifts and the use of respirators—are insufficient, arguing the practices would only increase the number of workers exposed to the dust and don’t sufficiently protect miners. The rule instead requires mining companies to implement engineering controls, such as ventilation and water sprays, as the primary method to meet lower exposure limits.

MSHA chose not to defend the rule in court, instead asking the Eighth Circuit in August to keep the case on hold as it discusses a potential settlement with the industry groups.

The agency also successfully urged the court to reject attempts by the American Thoracic Society, UMWA and United Steelworkers to intervene in the case in defense of the rule.

The administration has now requested a third delay from the court due to the federal government shutdown.

To some of those present at Tuesday’s rally, those moves represented a backslide on Trump’s promises to support coal workers.

Trump is a vocal ally of the coal industry and has taken steps to boost production of the fuel in his first months in office. The president’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandated that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining, and his administration has consistently sought to prop up the industry in executive and regulatory actions.

“President Trump said we’re going to dig, baby dig,” said Robinson. “OK, we can do that, but let’s take care of the health and safety of our miners.”

“I would ask him—put a pillow over your face, and that’s how these coal miners breathe. They smother every day,” Robinson said.

In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that “President Trump cares deeply about unleashing America’s energy potential, as well as standing up for those who fuel our country, such as hardworking coal miners.”

“Blue collar Americans played a key role in sending President Trump back to the White House because they know he has their back, and with the help of great leaders across the administration … he is working tirelessly to deliver policies that improve the livelihoods of working families across the nation,” Kelly said.

But Jason Walsh, a former Obama administration official and executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental organizations, said that Trump’s pro-coal rhetoric represented empty promises to the workers underpinning the industry.

“President Trump loves to use coal miners as political props. But when the cameras are turned off, he couldn’t care less whether they’re sick or healthy,” Walsh said.

“This is a guy who digs coal, loves coal, calls it beautiful. But what he really digs is coal industry profits. He really digs PAC checks from coal company CEOs. He couldn’t care less about miners or the communities they live in.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Coal-Miner-Rally-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 19:02:09.515575

In Louisiana, utilities regulators in August greenlit upward of $3 billion in grid improvements proposed by utilities provider Entergy solely to serve Meta’s largest data center, which requires more than twice the electricity powering New Orleans.

Yet with regulators sidelined from Meta and Entergy’s electricity use contract, consumer advocacy groups and some officials have raised concerns that Louisiana residents will be paying higher electricity bills down the line, as key details about the contract’s terms have been withheld from the public.

As more data centers pop up, demanding massive amounts of electricity and water, lawmakers and regulators are debating how to balance anticipated economic benefits with concerns about how the world’s most powerful corporations may undermine the economic and environmental health of their communities.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

U.S. demand for EVs had already started to drop early last year, but it’s now expected to really crater under President Donald Trump’s policies targeting the market.
The biggest blow is the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, which officially expired on Sept. 30.

In recent years, carmakers have made major investments, betting on electric cars becoming more mainstream, as well as to meet government regulations, but recent shifts in policy and politics have now made those bets costly.

General Motors is the latest company to show how this change is hitting its bottom line. The company said today, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that it would take a $1.6 billion hit on its quarterly earnings ending Sept. 30. The charge stems mostly from a drop in the value of its plants and equipment tied to its EV operations along with $400 million in fees and settlements related to canceling supplier contracts associated with EV investments.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the company said.

U.S. demand for EVs had already started to drop early last year, but it’s now expected to really crater under President Donald Trump’s policies targeting the market. The biggest blow is the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, which officially expired on Sept. 30. That incentive was scrapped under the administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

But the loss of subsidies isn’t the industry’s only hurdle. Earlier this year, Trump rolled back federal emissions standards and stripped states of the ability to set their own stricter rules. That move wiped out California and other states’ requirements that automakers sell more zero-emission vehicles.

The EV industry also faces cultural and consumer challenges. Elon Musk’s growing unpopularity has turned off some buyers, potentially dragging down demand not only for Teslas but for EVs in general.

GM said a “reassessment of our E.V. capacity and manufacturing footprint” is ongoing and could lead to even more costs in the future.

GM isn’t the only company bracing for an EV slowdown. Car companies like Nissan, Honda, and Ford are shifting their strategies, delaying launches and quietly shifting money back into internal combustion vehicles.

Just weeks ago, Ford CEO Jim Farley said at the Ford Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit that EV sales in the U.S. could be slashed in half in the foreseeable future.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” Farley told the audience, according to Bloomberg. EVs currently account for nearly 10% of the broader domestic market.

For his part, Farley thinks the industry should move toward “partial electrification” with more hybrid options. In his view, fully electric models make the most sense as commuter vehicles with short drives, accounting for only about 5% to 7% of the market.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.

Speaking at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center, Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02), the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and Partners for Environmental Justice to address concerns from local experts, community leaders and residents.

Whitehouse is in his fourth term in the Senate. He has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.

Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina. Rhode Island is subject to rain bursts — sudden amounts of precipitation in a short period of time — that can flood rivers and overwhelm sewage treatment facilities. The Ocean State also has rising sea levels, coastal storms, and erosion.

“Those are familiar topics to you here in North Carolina – upland river flooding from rain bursts and coastal erosion and storms tearing away at your coastal communities,” Whitehouse said.

Flooding, storm water, and storm control are familiar issues to Ross’s constituents in the second congressional district, she said, but they are less common in other parts of the state.

She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.

“It is a new [issue] to the North Carolina mountains and to many other areas in this country that are feeling the effects of climate change that have been spreading and worsening over time,” Ross said.

This raises costs for homeowners insurance, according to Whitehouse. He talked about insurance companies deeming properties too risky due to concerns with climate change, which then leads to increased rates for families.

A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.

“This is actually everywhere, and it opens a new era of a climate conversation that will give us the political power to solve the problem before it gets devastatingly worse,” he said.

Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation. He said the state now has the third highest rate of property insurance policy cancellations in the country.

In some coastal counties, more than one in 10 homeowners lost their coverage in 2023, he said.

“The message is clear: You can’t solve the insurance crisis without also addressing the climate crisis,” Crawford said. “Rising risk means rising cost, and unless we take action to make our communities more resilient and reduce the pollution driving these disasters, North Carolinians will continue to pay that price.”

State Commissioner of Insurance Mike Causey didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue.

Community members at the roundtable shared stories of losing a business in Chapel Hill due to flooding and neighborhoods being destroyed from Tropical Storm Chantal in July.

Others expressed concerns over policy, especially with cuts to resources like the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Flood Insurance Program.

Whitehouse said the NFIP “isn’t sound or fair now” and needs restructuring. Improvements should include better mapping, allowing people to know when they’re really at risk, and options for people to be able to get assistance to relocate before they have to rebuild their homes, he said.

“The whole program is failing right now, and so a very significant redo is required, but transparency and consumer options are two of the key pieces to make it right,” he told NC Newsline.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/nc_newsline_articles_683/3fc95e5b5825e65b016e974c63cc875b,N,,2025-10-14 20:03:18.659962

Learning From China’s Nuclear Licensing Unlike the United States, China employs a state-led national strategy to allocate resources and plan future infrastructure projects.
While Chinese nuclear finance is diversifying, the debt ratio of Chinese nuclear projects is around 70% to 80%, at interest rates as low as 1.4%--far lower rates than companies in other nations can secure.
For nuclear construction workers, the U.S. should retrain and mobilize skilled labor from adjacent heavy industries if possible.
Context China’s recent success in constructing nuclear reactors follows years of work to build a full nuclear industrial ecosystem.","While the United States generates the most nuclear energy globally, China is far ahead when it comes to the construction of new nuclear reactors. There is currently 35GW of generation, or 30 nuclear plants, being constructed in China—more than the rest of the world combined. But China is not just winning in terms of scale; it is leading in advanced technology deployment as well. China’s Linglong-1, or ACP-100, is the world’s first commercial small modular reactor (SMR) that has passed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) general safety review and is expected to be connected to the grid by the end of 2025.

In contrast, the United States has delivered little new nuclear capacity in the last three decades, and its most recent projects, Vogtle Units 3 and 4, faced massive delays and cost overruns.

There is consensus about how China has been able to build new nuclear faster than the rest of the world—industrial supply chain capacity combined with top-down strategic policy has dramatically expedited the growth of the Chinese nuclear industry. For nuclear supporters in the United States, there is also a consensus that the U.S. must learn from Chinese success. But, what lessons can be drawn? And, where will the U.S. need to pursue alternative strategies to accelerate nuclear deployment safely and effectively?

Some elements of China’s success—its top-down policy-making, direct public financing of new reactors, and low construction labor costs—are not likely to be repeatable, or even attractive, for the American nuclear industry. However, the United States can learn from China’s predictable licensing pathways, healthy support for financing, and focus on modular construction practices. Ultimately, China and the United States have dramatically different political economies, and what works in one place might not work in the other, but China’s success offers invaluable insights for the American nuclear industry to scale.

Learning From China’s Nuclear Licensing

Unlike the United States, China employs a state-led national strategy to allocate resources and plan future infrastructure projects. Whereas the U.S. nuclear sector is made up of private developers seeking license approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), every nuclear plant built in China is included in the “national strategy” ahead of its licensing and permitting process. When a nuclear project is proposed in China, a state-owned enterprise (SOE) establishes a subsidiary with the sole task of constructing the project and then operating the reactor. To date, China has never cancelled or denied a nuclear project after the State Council approved it as part of the national strategy.

Such a top-down approach to nuclear licensing is obviously impossible in the United States. There is no American national strategy that dictates the next 5 or 10 years of infrastructure construction. However, certain practices of Chinese nuclear licensing and regulation can be and should be adapted and applied in the U.S.

Technology-inclusive rulemaking

While first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactor builds are notoriously difficult to license anywhere in the world. China’s licensing regulations are generalized enough to accommodate technological development. The safety review regulation for reactor licensing is only 13 pages, and the regulatory framework for nuclear facility design totals 62 pages. The Chinese National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) reviews the application on a case-by-case basis, which does not force projects to jump through hoops that only apply to other technologies. Advanced reactor applicants have a slightly different application form from more traditional reactors, and do not need to demonstrate how their reactors are safe in contexts that are only applicable to older, larger reactors. Ultimately, the Chinese NNSA understands that advanced reactors are typically far safer, and should not be forced to demonstrate unnecessary safety steps during licensing.

On the other hand, the United States’ Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) licensing pathways, mainly 10 CFR Parts 52 and 50, both over 100 pages, were designed for traditional nuclear reactors originally built over half a century ago. This forces advanced reactor applicants to seek exemptions under these rules, requiring extra effort from both the applicant and the NRC staff and causing unnecessary delays.

Improving licensing of advanced reactors is already a priority in the U.S. context. The NRC is finalizing its Part 53 rulemaking to be risk-informed, technology-neutral, and performance-based. Part 53 will be the best of a “case-by-case” approach due to flexible performance objectives, while licensing decisions can be referenced in the future to speed things up. It is imperative to make Part 53 as predictable and flexible as the Chinese regulatory framework, such as allowing for alternative quality assurance programs, accepting flexible risk evaluation methodology other than Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), to be more compatible with Parts 50 and 52. The NRC must make Part 53 a clear, modern, and usable pathway to enable the efficient and timely licensing in the United States.

Predictability and Timeliness

While licensing might appear to be more streamlined and smoother in China than in the U.S., the Chinese nuclear licensing process is actually more complicated and bureaucratic. National strategy-making does offer more predictability that a project will ultimately be approved, but investors and developers must still wait years for final approval. For example, it took 18 years for the Gen IV reactor, Shidaowan, to go from proposal to operation (See Figure 1). Still, the licensing process was predictable enough that the project crew was prepared to start construction—known in the industry as reaching “first concrete day” or FCD—immediately after local State Council approval and the issuance of the construction permit from the national government.

19 out of the 30 (63%) Chinese nuclear plants that are currently under construction broke ground (i.e., reached FCD) within a couple of weeks of the issuance of a national construction permit or approval from the State Council, whichever arrives later. This indicates a much more streamlined—albeit not the fastest—licensing approach that does not leave developers in a licensing purgatory when a national regulatory agency approves a project, but a local agency does not, or vice versa.

Meanwhile, in the United States, approval from a state Public Utility Commission (PUC) can take months or even years after receiving a construction permit from the NRC. PUCs need to sign off on the final authorization to start a project, but they often don’t begin review until the project receives NRC approval, creating a licensing lag before FCD. Also, after the final approval, projects in the United States struggle to hire and mobilize thousands of workers. For example, Kairos received its construction permit for Hermes in December 2023 but could not break ground until July 2024. Similarly, Vogtle received its construction permit from the NRC in February 2012, but FCD for both reactors was not until 2013.

While some of the predictability of China’s nuclear licensing depends on continued top-down planning that is unique to the Chinese case, other aspects, like communication between national regulators and the State Councils, and between investors, developers, local communities, and other stakeholders, can be modified into American nuclear licensing to help promote efficiency and predictability.

To promote better predictability in the U.S. context, the NRC and PUCs should work together to issue construction permits and project authorizations in tandem. The NRC can also accelerate efficiency by fully implementing the performance-based Part 53 rule, streamlining environmental review, and removing uncontested mandatory hearings. Even if the NRC can take these steps, the U.S. nuclear licensing regime will likely be less predictable than China’s, but it can definitely be more efficient and faster. States have also started to streamline permitting by creating offices to consolidate processes and accelerate local approvals.

Lessons from Lower Rate Financing

In China, large SOEs are responsible for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which they do through a joint venture with local utilities, other electricity companies, or universities, depending on the specific project. In this way, SOEs can leverage more capital to build more projects with financial risks shared by other stakeholders. Crucially, these projects benefit from state-bank financing with low interest rates. While Chinese nuclear finance is diversifying, the debt ratio of Chinese nuclear projects is around 70% to 80%, at interest rates as low as 1.4%--far lower rates than companies in other nations can secure. China National Nuclear Corporation’s (CNNC) average cost of debt is 3-4%, and the floating rate could go down with a further decrease of the national loan prime rate set by the People’s Bank of China.

In the United States, financing cost is a huge barrier for nuclear projects. Financing cost for a nuclear plant refers to the total expense of debt and equity financing, and the interest rate is highly correlated with the cost of debt. Because nuclear projects require massive upfront investment and long construction timelines, borrowing costs can account for up to two-thirds of a project's total cost when the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is as high as 9%. Lowering the cost of capital is therefore critical to attract new investors and to assuage developers’ and utilities’ concerns about financial and construction risk.

While the U.S. cannot offer the state ownership structures, milestone-based financing incentives that incrementally reduce interest rates when project milestones are achieved on time can encourage timely project completion and help nuclear developers to establish an orderbook. The Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office (LPO) can provide loan guarantees and create a precedent for the private sector to follow. Coupled with investment tax credit (ITC), a milestone-based program could reduce financial risk while respecting market structures and private-sector decision-making. What’s more, state-level policy can step in by switching to Clean Energy Stands to make nuclear eligible for low-interest financing programs.

Taking Cues from Chinese Construction Approaches

Core Designs and Modular Construction

To reach nuclear at scale, China chose to build multiple types of reactor technologies, while developing a “core design” for each reactor type to better build the Nth-of-a-kind via “learning-by-doing”. For example, China has built and improved the Hualong One (HPR-1000) design over 10 domestic reactor builds, plus multiple overseas, while simultaneously building two CAP-1400 reactors with plans to build more in the future. For SMRs, China recognizes the value of modular construction and has already fabricated an integrated module for the Linglong-1 project, an important step toward making future SMR production resemble an automated assembly line.

A standardized “core design” can avoid inconsistent fuel and parts supply and reduce redundant workforce training, and streamline licensing reviews, which improves industry safety standards and reduces costs. China’s nuclear planner witnessed how nuclear power pioneers, such as the United States and Russia, used inconsistent reactor designs for nuclear power, which ultimately increased construction and operation costs, and made each project FOAK.

But, instead of choosing a single “core design” and trying to build as many of that reactor type as possible, the Chinese nuclear industry has developed a “core design” for multiple reactor technologies that can fit the needs of different locations and needs. According to a report by Orient Securities, “The same model should be built in batches of about 6 to 10 units to maximize industry benefits.” To enhance this strategy, China is gradually building up a nuclear supply chain with a focus on making the main components of its reactors domestically. Over the past two decades, China has prioritized domestic manufacturing of key reactor components, increasing local content from about 50% in the early 2000s to over 90%.

For the United States, it is unrealistic for the government to focus on one or even just a couple of advanced nuclear technologies. However, with the correct incentives, the market will naturally filter the most successful standardized designs. The US already has a “core design” for the AP-1000, and can adopt a more modular approach focused on iterative improvement. Modular assembly can reduce construction costs and improve efficiency without relying on overworked labor. To support this strategy, the United States should strengthen the domestic supply chain through subsidies or targeted policy levers. At the same time, restrictions on imported fuels or critical components could slow industry growth and increase uncertainty for actual nuclear deployment.

Intensive Labor and Workforce

The workforce is the backbone of China’s nuclear deployment speed. Typical construction workers are usually in their early 20s with a limited educational background who work long hours. Multiple shifts—including night shifts—are the norm during construction, especially immediately following FCD. Labor in China is relatively cheap, reducing costs for nuclear developers, and laborers often work under minimal labor regulations. For example, during the construction of Tianwan Station in 2023, workers had to move materials at night to maintain continuous progress. 900 workers stayed on-site through the Chinese New Year, the country’s most important national holiday, to complete the dome lift on schedule.

Nuclear plant construction in China and the United States is equally labor-intensive. At peak construction, Vogtle 3 and 4 had more than 9,000 workers on site, similar to large Chinese projects, but at a significantly higher cost. A nuclear construction worker in the United States earns roughly $80,000 per year, while a similar worker in China only earns around ¥80,000 (~$12,000).

However, the US workers are more protected through unions. The U.S. nuclear industry employs roughly 19% unionized labor—one of the highest unionized rates among all energy sources in the U.S. Overseen by the NRC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the U.S. nuclear workforce has collective bargaining rights, regulated working hours, and enforceable workplace standards, and does not work the same extended shifts as its Chinese counterparts.

American nuclear developers should not seek to replicate the low-cost, high-risk labor practices found in China. For nuclear construction workers, the U.S. should retrain and mobilize skilled labor from adjacent heavy industries if possible. In the meantime, the U.S. should focus on expanding operational nuclear workforce pipelines through apprenticeships and university programs that bring in high-skill, efficient workers who can help expedite construction and further improve American reactor builds. Cultivating a new generation of licensed operators, reactor engineers, and maintenance specialists will be critical to sustaining long-term plant performance and reliability.

International Partnerships

Over the past decade, China has been exporting its nuclear technology as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China has already constructed six reactors in Pakistan and plans to build around 30 overseas reactors by 2030. China’s nuclear exports accelerate its construction learning curve for developers by allowing for more projects in the short term. It also strengthens China’s global nuclear presence, builds diplomatic and commercial relationships, and creates opportunities for learning and standardizing reactor designs across multiple countries.

Building cooperative relationships with Western allies, such as the UK and France, can help American nuclear developers in ways other than exporting reactors. The US can strengthen multilateral nuclear partnerships and diversify the nuclear supply chain, such as by collaborating with the U.K. or France to access their established nuclear fuel recycling capabilities. In the long run, the U.S. should aim to export more reactors, which can similarly expand U.S. construction experience and drive down the future cost for US domestic nuclear deployment. In this way, the U.S. will be a more appealing partner for other countries, both for purchasing reactor designs and for expanding broader nuclear cooperation.

Adapting to the U.S. Context

China’s recent success in constructing nuclear reactors follows years of work to build a full nuclear industrial ecosystem. Planners accepted that early projects would be difficult and costly, but committed to pushing through, and now, China benefits from faster builds and lower costs.

The U.S. can’t replicate this overnight, but it must invest in developing its own nuclear ecosystem at every layer. Trump’s May executive orders calling for NRC reform, streamlined environmental reviews, more efficient licensing, and the deployment of 300GW of new nuclear energy by 2050 are a good start, but the US needs thorough support from coordinated policy, capital, and institutional resources. Specifically, the US needs to:

Create a predictable and efficient regulatory framework

Generate national-level demand for new nuclear plants by committing to purchase electricity through long-term market contracts, providing developers with firm orders and revenue certainty

Incentivize timely project completion through milestone-based financing mechanisms

Seek “core designs” and improve through iterative production, and promote modular construction practices

Develop a skilled, resilient workforce through training programs and university pipelines

The Mexico City government, through the Ministry of Environment (SEDEMA), is implementing a comprehensive climate action plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 35%. The plan allocates 10% of reductions to initiatives in partnership with the private sector and 25% to government-led actions, including sustainable mobility, waste management, water reuse, and green energy generation.

Brugada noted that over MX$1 billion (US$54.05 million) have been invested in the Altepetl program, which protects conservation land and benefits producers of corn, nopal, vegetables, honey, and flowers. The program has restored 4.5 million m2 of green land encroached by urban development, with a goal of reclaiming an additional 100,000m2 per week.

The government has also declared Mexico City free of genetically modified corn and recognized the biocultural heritage of the agricultural terraces in Xochimilco, Tlahuac, Milpa Alta, and Tlapacoya, in coordination with SEDEMA and local communities.

This year, ecotechnologies will be installed in homes, including rainwater harvesting systems, solar water heaters, and urban gardens, developed jointly by SEDEMA and the Ministry of Housing.

Urban revegetation and reforestation programs continue, with a goal of planting trees, shrubs, and plants across the city. Forty percent of the 1,400ha across 26 designated environmental areas have been rehabilitated. Illegal logging was stopped in the San Miguel Topilejo forest in Tlalpan, and 20,000 trees have been treated for pests. Additionally, 1,500 diseased palm trees are being replaced under the Integral Palm Care Program.

In waste management, the government highlighted the establishment of the Governing Body of the Integrated Waste Management Agency (AGIR) and the launch of the Zero Waste strategy, targeting the transformation of 50% of the city’s solid waste. Initiatives include the creation of the first Circular Economy Park at Bordo Poniente, modernization of the composting plant, and construction of two new facilities next year.

Brugada called on citizens and Congress to join the campaign, Transform the City: Every Piece Waste in Its Place, which will mandate waste separation starting Jan. 1, 2026. She emphasized SEDEMA’s and the city government’s commitment to a cleaner, greener, and sustainable city.

Under the approved provisional load process, SPP will consider a transmission customer’s planned generation when studying a request to add load.
SPP contends the provisional load process will encourage generation resources to be built, according to the grid operator’s application.
Also, the process may attract other load interconnection customers to the SPP region, the grid operator said.
SPP runs the power grid and wholesale electricity markets across parts of 14 states from Texas to North Dakota.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday approved a Southwest Power Pool proposal — called the “provisional load process” — that will let the grid operator study potential data centers and other load additions even when there isn’t available power to serve the new facilities.

SPP’s proposed process “will facilitate transmission customers’ efforts to appropriately and more expeditiously plan to serve their future loads,” FERC said.

Recently, SPP has been unable to study many transmission customers’ requests for load additions because they lacked power supplies to cover their 10-year load forecast, including the load addition — a requirement under the grid operator’s rules for load interconnection studies to move ahead, the grid operator said in its June 4 proposal at FERC.

Under the approved provisional load process, SPP will consider a transmission customer’s planned generation when studying a request to add load. The process will give transmission customers time to procure firm transmission service for planned generation needed to serve new load, according to the grid operator.

SPP contends the provisional load process will encourage generation resources to be built, according to the grid operator’s application. Also, the process may attract other load interconnection customers to the SPP region, the grid operator said.

SPP runs the power grid and wholesale electricity markets across parts of 14 states from Texas to North Dakota.

Under the provisional load process, the costs of network upgrades needed to interconnect new load will be assigned to the transmission customer until planned generation has been included in the transmission customer’s transmission service agreement, according to FERC. After that, any remaining network upgrade costs will be rolled into zonal or regional rates.

The cost allocation plan protects transmission customers from paying for network upgrades for generating resources that change from the original plan or that don’t get built, according to SPP.

Separately, SPP is advancing a 90-day interconnection study process for “high impact large load” that will be paired with new generation or for interconnecting large loads with current or planned generation. The policy, approved by SPP’s board last month, will require FERC approval.

Like other grid operators, SPP has seen a jump in requested load additions, including large loads like data centers and manufacturing plants, according to the grid operator.

Since 2020, SPP has received 26.4 GW of load interconnection requests larger than 100 MW, including 9 GW disclosed as data centers, the grid operator said in its proposal at FERC.

Other automakers have also scaled back EV goals after years of investment in domestic supply chains. It’s left some battery manufacturers in the U.S. with extra capacity that’s now helping to power up the market for grid storage.

Manufacturers are faced with a problem: they have a nice new battery supply chain all charged up, with not enough electric cars to power.

“If you stood up these factories, you want to keep them producing,” said Jay Whitacre, a professor of energy engineering and policy at Carnegie Mellon university.

He said battery producers and suppliers that were focused on cars can fairly easily switch to making batteries that hold electricity for the grid.

“They can use the same production line, typically, to make these cells,” Whitacre said.

Stationary batteries are needed to store renewable energy from wind and solar that’s generated intermittently. But they’re also increasingly in demand for data centers.

“They want these plants to be reliable, and so regardless of where the power is coming from, whether it's coming from renewables or coming from burning coal, they're all installing energy storage systems to provide backup power,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Telemetry market research.

He pointed to EV battery maker LG which already converted one of its major U.S. production facilities to grid storage.

“And I wouldn't be surprised to see some other plants that have excess capacity follow a similar path,” said Abuelsamid.

Even the annual Battery Show held in Detroit last week had a different flavor according to Mickael Havelle at the battery materials supplier Arkema. Where in the past, car batteries were the belle of the ball.

“This year we saw, like energy storage used for data centers and AI, for sure, that was an emphasis,” Havelle said.

Arkema sells specialized coatings and binders for lithium-ion batteries, whether they’re in cars or stationary.

“So, for us, we are kind of agnostic,” Havelle said.

The financial exposure treatment significantly raised the share of subjects supporting the Abundance approach.","On October 9, 2025, FSI Senior Fellow Saumitra Jha presented his team’s research on how exposure to financial markets — meaning individuals’ exposure to tailored opportunities to directly engage with investment platforms and decision-making — can increase support for action on climate change. This CDDRL research seminar expanded on Jha’s earlier research on the effects of financial exposure and literacy as tools for reducing political polarization, including studies conducted in Israel, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.

During the seminar, Jha highlighted the study's relevance in an era of democratic backsliding, rising populism on both the right and the left, and increasing economic uncertainty. Jha emphasized that basic financial literacy — the ability to understand and practically apply financial concepts such as saving, investing, and diversifying risks— is essential for citizens navigating this environment. Jha’s team designed interventions that empower citizens, both in rich and poor countries, to build financial knowledge and, by focusing on common investments and the common good, ultimately mitigate political polarization and conflict.

The study focused on the partisan issue of climate change in the United States. Participants were oversampled from states either disproportionately affected by climate change or central to the green-energy transition — Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Arizona, Ohio, South Carolina, and Kentucky. Each participant in the treatment group initially received an investment portfolio that tracked stocks from either green energy companies (firms at the forefront of the transition, engaged in renewable energy like solar and wind) or brown energy companies (firms earlier in the transition, engaged in the extraction of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas). Subjects had $50–$100 of real money or a virtual portfolio of funds to invest.

For five weeks, participants used a Robinhood-style investment platform (a simple online interface for buying and selling stocks) to trade their stocks. Midway through the study, they were able to trade across both green and brown stocks. At this point, they received additional financial disclosures (basic company performance data) and had access to climate-impact disclosures (data on companies' greenhouse gas emissions and how they affect or are affected by climate change). However, this is currently a central policy debate; very few participants actually chose to review climate disclosures, which Jha identified as a research question for a companion paper. The research team then evaluated results in four categories: (1) beliefs about human agency and tradeoffs with the green energy transition, (2) policy preferences, (3) political attitudes, and (4) personal behaviors.

The data demonstrated that this financial exposure treatment — i.e., hands-on stock trading experience — had a significant, meaningful, and lasting influence on participants’ beliefs. Relative to control, treated participants were 9% more likely to agree or strongly agree that human activity is a significant contributor to climate change. They further became more supportive of both government and corporate action to mitigate climate change, and came to view the green-energy transition as potentially economically beneficial.

Further, the intervention was empowering, raising the financial literacy of participants and increasing their ongoing consumption of financial news outlets, rather than social media or Fox News. These effects were observable even eight months after the study.

Further, these changes were not preaching to the choir — instead, the effects were observed across the political spectrum, particularly among those who were ex ante climate change skeptics. However, while treated participants were more likely to donate to climate causes and to consider climate when investing and working, they did not report an overall increased willingness to change their daily lives. For example, while reporting an increased willingness to reuse recyclable bags, most did not report an increased willingness to change ingrained daily habits, such as eating less meat or changing commute patterns.

Jha also previewed new results from a companion paper based on a long-term survey conducted 8 months after treatment. To examine how the treatment changes how participants preferred climate action to be implemented, the research team gauged support for two approaches: the “Abundance approach”, popularized by Ezra Klein, and the “Conservation and Regulation approach.” The Abundance approach emphasizes expanding investments in clean energy infrastructure, sustainable housing, and economic growth as solutions to climate change. By contrast, the Conservation and Regulation approach focuses on reducing energy use through government regulation, strong local autonomy, and personal restraint.

That endangers not just sustainability but also agriculture itself, which will suffer from climate impacts,” Mr. Tatto warned.
The environmental caucus believes that the anti-environmental agenda harms Brazil’s international image.
It leaves us in a contradictory position as COP host,” Mr. Tatto said.
According to ministry sources, efforts have focused on defending the environmental licensing framework from setbacks, leaving “little room” for advancing new positive initiatives.","The leadership of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate declined to comment. Behind the scenes, however, lawmakers say the polarized political climate has made it difficult to advance a constructive legislative agenda.

According to Nilto Tatto (Workers’ Party, PT, São Paulo), coordinator of the Joint Parliamentary Front for the Environment, there is a disconnect between the urgency of the climate crisis and Congress’s actions.

“While the government works to show results in reducing deforestation and seeks international financial support, Congress moves in the opposite direction, prioritizing regulatory rollbacks such as relaxed licensing and land regularization,” Mr. Tatto said.

For Suely Araújo, policy coordinator at the Observatório do Clima, the vote on the licensing vetoes—scheduled for Thursday (16)—is particularly worrisome.

“The farm caucus is expected to fight for the vetoes’ overturn. Another red flag is the Foreign Affairs Committee’s rejection of the Escazú Agreement,” she noted. Signed in New York in 2018, the Escazú Agreement is the first environmental treaty in Latin America and the Caribbean to guarantee access to information, justice, and protection for environmental defenders. Although Brazil signed it, congressional ratification is still pending.

The bill’s rapporteur, Congressman Evair Vieira de Melo (Progressives Party, PP, Espírito Santo), recommended rejecting the treaty, citing “practical implications and potential risks to national sovereignty and Brazil’s economic interests.”

“It’s extremely rare for Congress to reject an international agreement,” Mr. Araújo explained. “It reflects pressure from the ruralist bloc, criticism of environmental regulation, and fears about transparency—for instance, concerns that rural property data could become publicly available.”

Environmentalists are prioritizing the preservation of the presidential vetoes this week, though the likelihood of their being overturned is high. “If Congress overturns them, the only recourse will be to challenge the law before the Supreme Court through a direct action of unconstitutionality,” said Mr. Araújo.

Mr. Tatto attributes the lack of progress to the influence of the ruralist bloc—aligned with conservatives and the political center—and to polarization ahead of the municipal elections. “Today’s Congress is out of sync with the climate crisis,” he argued.

He noted that 2024 saw some positive developments, including the regulation of carbon markets, biofuels, and energy transition, often with support from agribusiness lawmakers.

“This year, however, there’s no long-term perspective—only short-term political interests. That endangers not just sustainability but also agriculture itself, which will suffer from climate impacts,” Mr. Tatto warned.

The environmental caucus believes that the anti-environmental agenda harms Brazil’s international image. “Congress undermines Brazil’s climate diplomacy. International observers interpret our votes as the country’s position, regardless of the government’s efforts in multilateral negotiations. It leaves us in a contradictory position as COP host,” Mr. Tatto said.

In March, Environment Minister Marina Silva met with 30 lawmakers to align a legislative strategy for COP30, but little progress has been made. According to ministry sources, efforts have focused on defending the environmental licensing framework from setbacks, leaving “little room” for advancing new positive initiatives.

Mr. Tatto said he plans to ask Chamber President Hugo Motta (Republicans of Paraíba) to bring at least a few pro-environment bills to the floor before the summit.

The 2025 Legislative Agenda, published by the Observatório do Clima and backed by 22 environmental organizations, identifies a “destruction package” of bills that could severely harm ecosystems, traditional peoples’ rights, and Brazil’s climate targets. These include measures that weaken licensing and land laws, alter the Forest Code and the Atlantic Forest Law, and even allow privatization of coastal zones.

On the positive side, environmentalists hope to advance proposals such as the Law of the Sea (creating a national marine conservation policy), the Circular Economy Bill (setting plastic reduction and recycling targets while compensating waste pickers), and the National Policy for Biodiversity Economy (PNDEB).

Other key proposals include a constitutional amendment recognizing climate security as a fundamental right, tougher penalties for environmental crimes, and the Agenda 2030 Bill, which aligns national policy with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/5D2wh42NsJ8hT5DfHWm0njVTlbw=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_37554604729d4b2f9f3eb9ad8a691345/internal_photos/bs/2025/l/y/ZiNlXSTkeHgwPKntcZzQ/resexituxi45.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 21:59:49.387129

The 22 states that have put CPA pathways laws in place to date this year are: Ohio, Virginia, Utah, Indiana, New Mexico, Iowa, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, Hawaii, Alaska, Illinois, Connecticut, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Delaware and California.","In the wake of a recent 11th hour agreement averting a Michigan budget crisis, proponents of the state’s certified public accountant licensure reform bill want to see similar just-in-time action pushing the CPA legislation to passage by year-end.

“This year, that’s the hope,” Bob Doyle, CEO of the Michigan Association of Certified Public Accountants, said in an interview, noting that he anticipates that the resolution of the budget should help free up lawmakers to move forward with other legislation such as the CPA reform bill.

If that timing is realized, Michigan could help bring closer to the halfway mark the number of states that have put CPA pathways bills on the books this yearwhich set up new rules that don’t require candidates to complete 150 hours of college credits, effectively a fifth year of college, to become certified. New York, where the legislation is still awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature, and Massachusetts, are also viewed as contenders to do so in 2025, CFO Dive previously reported.

Michigan’s legislation (HB 4893) was first introduced last month by state Rep. Mark Tisdel, who chairs the House Finance Committee.

MICPA is hoping to get the bill heard by the Finance Committee as early as next week. But there’s a wrinkle: Doyle said the original bill needs to be amended to align with the industry’s Uniform Accountancy Act that many states are using as a legislative guideline as well as to fix details related to the years of experience needed by candidates.

A spokesperson for Tisdel’s office said the revisions are “part of the legislative process” and that the plan is to introduce the substitute language, shared with CFO Dive by both the spokesperon and Doyle, at the next committee meeting.

Working with the sponsor’s office, Doyle said the revised legislation would keep the state’s existing pathway that requires 150 college credit hours (a baccalaureate degree plus 30 credits or baccalaureate plus a master’s), along with one year of qualified work experience and passage of the CPA exam, while adding a new route to a CPA license which includes a baccalaureate degree plus two years of qualified work experience and passing the exam. A baccalaureate is equivalent to a bachelor’s.

The draft will not include an effective date, but Doyle said the idea is for the bill to be effective when signed into law by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. While Doyle said it’s not a “big deal” if the legislation does not get passed this year, he added that he would prefer to be aligned with other states, noting that there’s great interest in the change.

“I want to get it moving, I don’t want to wait,” Doyle said.

Supporters of alternative pathways hope to ease an accounting talent shortage by removing what they say is a costly barrier that typically equates to a total of five years in college or graduate school. Some critics have raised concerns about a messy transition period to the new requirements as well as worries about a potential lowering of standards while proponents note that many older CPAs were licensed before the current 150 hour requirement was in place.

Domestic lithium compounds avoid the 25% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports while qualifying for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.","Lithium Refining Revolution: How Texas Fits into Lithium Universe's Strategic Expansion

The global race to secure lithium supply chains is intensifying as battery manufacturers and automakers compete for reliable sources of this critical mineral. At the center of this competition is a critical challenge facing North America: the ""lithium conversion gap."" Lithium Universe's bold move to establish a second refinery in Texas represents a strategic response to this challenge, creating a dual-location processing platform spanning the United States and Canada.

What is the Lithium Conversion Gap and Why Does It Matter?

North America faces a significant disconnect between its battery manufacturing ambitions and its lithium refining capabilities. While billions of dollars are being invested in battery gigafactories across the continent, the region lacks sufficient domestic capacity to convert raw lithium materials into the high-purity compounds these facilities require.

This ""lithium conversion gap"" has created a precarious situation where battery manufacturers must rely heavily on overseas refineries, particularly in Asia. The dependency introduces multiple vulnerabilities:

Supply chain risks: Reliance on long international shipping routes exposes manufacturers to logistical disruptions

Geopolitical concerns: Critical minerals energy security becomes subject to international relations

Economic leakage: Value-added processing occurs offshore rather than creating domestic jobs

Sustainability impacts: Extended transportation increases carbon footprint of battery production

Without addressing this bottleneck, North America's transition to electric vehicles faces significant headwinds, potentially slowing adoption rates and limiting economic benefits. The gap between regional demand and processing capabilities continues to widen as more battery manufacturing capacity comes online.

Industry analysts project North American lithium demand could increase five-fold by 2030, while current domestic refining capacity meets less than 10% of anticipated needs. This disparity has prompted governments to implement policies specifically targeting this vulnerability in the battery supply chain.

Why is Lithium Universe Expanding to Texas?

Lithium Universe's announcement of a second lithium carbonate refinery in Brownsville, Texas represents a strategic expansion of the company's North American footprint. This development complements rather than competes with the company's flagship Bécancour project in Québec.

According to Iggy Tan, Executive Chairman of Lithium Universe Ltd, ""Brownsville represents an extraordinary opportunity to extend our lithium refinery strategy beyond Québec. With the Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Energy programs, and clear national ambitions for critical mineral independence, the timing is ideal to establish a foothold in Texas.""

The dual-location strategy creates a binational processing platform that addresses different regional markets while maximizing policy advantages in both countries:

Strategic Geographic Positioning

Québec facility: Serves as a Trans-Atlantic hub powered by Hydro-Québec's renewable energy, primarily supplying Canadian and European markets

Texas facility: Functions as the U.S. hub, integrated with Gulf Coast logistics and positioned closer to American gigafactories

This geographic diversification offers several compelling advantages:

Risk mitigation: Reduces vulnerability to regional disruptions by operating in two distinct jurisdictions

Market access: Places processing capacity closer to end-users, reducing logistics costs and complexity

Policy optimization: Leverages incentives available in both U.S. and Canadian regulatory environments

Feedstock flexibility: Enables sourcing of raw materials from diverse global suppliers

Customer diversification: Facilitates relationships with battery manufacturers in multiple markets

Importantly, the company emphasizes that Bécancour remains its first priority, with the definitive feasibility study completed and offtake discussions underway. The Texas initiative represents a parallel growth pathway rather than a diversion of focus.

What Makes Brownsville an Ideal Location?

The Port of Brownsville Business Park offers a unique combination of logistical, infrastructural, and economic advantages that make it particularly well-suited for lithium refining operations:

Strategic Logistics Benefits

The site's multimodal connectivity creates exceptional efficiency for both incoming raw materials and outgoing refined products:

Deep-water port access: Enables direct maritime transport of spodumene concentrate from global sources including U.S., Brazilian and African mines

Highway connectivity: Adjacent to major transportation corridors for efficient distribution to U.S. battery manufacturers

Rail infrastructure: Direct connections to national rail networks further diversify logistics options

Proximity to technology corridor: Located approximately 230km south of Tesla's lithium hydroxide refinery at Corpus Christi and near SpaceX's Boca Chica Starbase facility

Infrastructure Readiness

The industrial-zoned location offers significant advantages for rapid implementation:

Pre-existing utilities: Established power, water, and gas infrastructure reduces capital requirements

Industrial ecosystem: Surrounding industrial operations create shared resources and services

Flat terrain: Simplifies construction and reduces site preparation costs

Brownfield benefits: Building within an established industrial zone streamlines permitting processes

Economic Advantages

The Texas location offers distinct cost benefits compared to alternative sites:

Competitive labor market: Access to skilled chemical processing workforce at competitive rates

Lower land costs: More affordable property values compared to other industrial centers

Tax environment: Texas offers favorable tax treatment for manufacturing operations

Business climate: Pro-industry regulatory approach reduces compliance complexity

Expansion potential: Sufficient land for multiple processing trains and complementary operations

The site is reportedly large enough to accommodate both lithium refining and photovoltaic recycling operations, creating potential for a multi-commodity clean energy hub. This co-location strategy creates operational synergies while maximizing the economic value of the property.

How Will the Texas Refinery Be Designed?

Lithium Universe plans to implement a ""copy-and-paste"" approach for its Texas facility, replicating its proven Bécancour refinery design with strategic modifications for the Gulf Coast environment:

Technical Specifications

The refinery's core parameters demonstrate significant production capacity:

Production capacity: Each refinery train designed to produce approximately 18,270 tonnes per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium refinery

Scalable configuration: Facility designed for dual-train operation, potentially exceeding 36,000 tpa at full capacity

Process technology: Utilizing the established Jiangsu continuous-process flow methodology

Gulf Coast adaptations: Removing cold-weather modifications while adding hurricane-specific structural safeguards

Integrated operations: Site large enough to accommodate both lithium refining and photovoltaic recycling operations

The continuous-flow process technology represents a mature, proven approach to lithium refining, contrasting with some experimental technologies being explored elsewhere in the sector. This established methodology reduces technical risk while maintaining high product quality.

Economic Outlook

Based on the Bécancour definitive feasibility study (DFS), the economic parameters for the Texas facility appear promising:

Net present value: US$718 million (Bécancour reference)

Internal rate of return: 21% (Bécancour reference)

Payback period: Under four years (Bécancour reference)

Potential enhancement: Lower construction and operating costs in Texas may improve these metrics further

The copy-and-paste approach offers significant economic advantages beyond the direct financial metrics:

Reduced engineering time: Using existing designs minimizes front-end engineering costs

Lower technical risk: Implementing proven systems rather than unproven technologies

Accelerated timeline: Faster path from approval to production

Supply chain efficiency: Established relationships with equipment suppliers

Operational familiarity: Consistent processes enable shared expertise across facilities

This pragmatic approach prioritizes execution speed and reliability over experimental technologies that might offer theoretical advantages but with higher implementation risks.

How Does This Fit into U.S. Critical Minerals Strategy?

The Brownsville refinery aligns seamlessly with several key U.S. policy initiatives aimed at securing domestic supply chains for critical minerals:

Policy Alignment

The project intersects with multiple federal priorities:

Inflation Reduction Act: Domestically refined lithium compounds qualify for significant tax credits under the IRA's domestic manufacturing provisions

Critical Minerals Security: Supports U.S. goals of reducing dependency on foreign processing, particularly from geopolitical competitors

Tariff Advantages: Avoids the 25% tariffs imposed on Chinese lithium compounds, creating a significant price advantage for domestic production

Department of Energy Support: Potential eligibility for loan programs specifically targeting critical minerals infrastructure development

This policy environment creates substantial financial incentives for domestic lithium refining, effectively reducing capital costs and improving project economics compared to historical conditions.

Supply Chain Integration

The facility creates strategic connections across the battery value chain:

Upstream integration: Direct access to spodumene concentrate from domestic and international sources

Midstream processing: Converting raw materials into battery-grade compounds domestically

Downstream proximity: Reducing logistics costs and complexity for U.S. battery manufacturers

Circular economy potential: Co-location with recycling operations creates opportunities for materials recovery

By addressing the critical midstream processing bottleneck, the facility helps complete a domestic supply chain that has been fragmented and heavily dependent on overseas processing. This integration reduces transportation costs, carbon emissions, and supply chain risks while capturing more economic value within the North American economy.

Strategic Independence Benefits

Beyond direct economic advantages, the facility contributes to broader national objectives:

Energy transition enablement: Supporting domestic electric vehicle manufacturing capacity

National security enhancement: Reducing dependency on potentially unreliable international sources

Innovation ecosystem development: Creating clusters of battery-related expertise and capabilities

Export potential: Establishing capacity that could serve international markets in addition to domestic needs

These strategic benefits align with broader governmental objectives of ensuring critical mineral security while transitioning to lower-carbon energy systems.

What's the Timeline and Next Steps?

While Lithium Universe emphasizes that Bécancour remains its first priority, with the definitive feasibility study completed and offtake discussions underway, the company is advancing the Texas initiative along a parallel track:

Development Pathway

The Texas project is progressing through several concurrent workstreams:

Site evaluation: Currently assessing specific land parcels within the Port of Brownsville Business Park

Regulatory pathway: Engaging with relevant authorities to establish permitting requirements

Engineering adaptation: Modifying the Bécancour design for Gulf Coast conditions

Funding strategy: Exploring U.S. government support mechanisms and potential partners

This multi-track approach allows for efficient progression while maintaining flexibility to adjust based on findings from each workstream.

Key Milestones

While specific dates have not been disclosed, the logical sequence of milestones would include:

Site selection finalization: Completing land acquisition within the industrial park

Permitting applications: Submitting environmental, construction, and operational permits

Engineering completion: Finalizing Gulf Coast-specific design adaptations

Funding arrangements: Securing government support and private financing

Construction commencement: Breaking ground once permits and financing are secured

Commissioning and startup: Systematic activation of processing systems

Commercial production: Achieving design capacity and quality specifications

Chemical processing facilities typically require 18-24 months for construction once permits are secured, suggesting a multi-year development timeline from announcement to production.

Parallel Process Considerations

The company's dual-project strategy creates both challenges and opportunities:

Resource allocation: Balancing management attention and capital between projects

Knowledge transfer: Applying lessons from Bécancour to optimize Texas implementation

Staged development: Potential to sequence construction for capital efficiency

Supplier relationships: Leveraging economies of scale across two similar facilities

The parallel development approach potentially creates synergies between the projects while diversifying execution risk across multiple jurisdictions.

How Does This Compare to Other North American Lithium Projects?

The Brownsville refinery represents a distinct approach compared to other North American lithium initiatives:

Competitive Positioning

Several factors differentiate Lithium Universe's approach from competitors:

Focus on midstream processing: Unlike many competitors focused on mining or battery manufacturing, Lithium Universe targets the critical refining bottleneck

Proven technology transfer: Leveraging established processing methods rather than experimental approaches

Dual-location strategy: Creating geographic diversification that most single-site competitors lack

Integrated recycling potential: Building synergies between primary refining and materials recovery

This specialized focus on the conversion gap contrasts with vertically integrated approaches that attempt to control the entire supply chain but may lack specific expertise in the complex chemistry of lithium refining.

Market Differentiation

The facility's design philosophy creates additional competitive advantages:

Rapid deployment potential: Copy-and-paste design approach enables faster implementation than custom facilities

Scalable capacity: Modular train design allows phased expansion to match market growth

Multi-commodity potential: Facility designed to accommodate both lithium processing and recycling operations

Trans-Atlantic platform: Combined with Bécancour, creates a unique dual-continent processing capability

This combination of speed, flexibility, and geographic diversification creates a more resilient business model compared to single-site operations with less adaptable designs.

Competitive Landscape

The North American lithium processing sector remains underdeveloped relative to demand, with limited existing capacity:

Current operations: Albemarle's Silver Peak (Nevada) and Livent's operations remain the primary active lithium producers in the U.S.

Announced projects: Tesla's Corpus Christi facility and Albemarle's Kings Mountain expansion represent major competing initiatives

Market gap: Even with all announced projects, significant supply shortfalls are projected through 2030

The limited competitive landscape suggests sufficient market demand for multiple successful projects, especially those able to achieve production before 2027 when supply constraints are expected to be most acute.

What Are the Environmental Considerations?

The Brownsville facility incorporates several sustainability elements designed to minimize environmental impacts while maximizing resource efficiency:

Environmental Design Elements

Modern refining operations incorporate numerous sustainability features:

Potential for renewable energy integration: Texas offers significant solar and wind resources that could power operations

Water management innovations: Process designs that minimize freshwater consumption through recycling and treatment systems

Circular economy synergies: Co-location with recycling operations reduces transportation impacts while enabling materials recovery

Modern emissions controls: Implementation of latest technologies to minimize air quality impacts

These design elements reflect contemporary expectations for industrial facilities, particularly those in the clean energy supply chain.

Gulf Coast Adaptations

The Texas location presents specific environmental considerations:

Hurricane resilience: Structural reinforcements and drainage systems to manage extreme weather events

Heat management: Systems designed for high ambient temperatures and humidity

Flood mitigation: Site elevation and drainage to manage coastal flood risks

Habitat protection: Compliance with regulations protecting sensitive coastal ecosystems

These adaptations ensure environmental protection while maintaining operational reliability in the Gulf Coast environment.

Permitting Pathway

Chemical processing facilities require comprehensive environmental permits:

Air quality permits: Emissions monitoring and control systems to meet Clean Air Act requirements

Water discharge permits: Treatment systems to ensure any water releases meet quality standards

Waste management planning: Systems for handling and disposing of processing residues

Environmental impact assessment: Comprehensive evaluation of potential environmental effects

The established industrial zone location potentially streamlines this process compared to greenfield sites in less developed areas.

""Environmental performance of any chemical processing facility depends on both design specifications and operational practices,"" according to ListCorp's analysis of Lithium Universe's Texas plans. ""Actual outcomes will depend on regulatory compliance, operational management, and ongoing monitoring and mitigation efforts.""

FAQ: Lithium Universe's Texas Expansion

How does this project affect Lithium Universe's Québec priorities?

Bécancour remains the company's primary focus, with the Texas initiative representing a parallel growth pathway rather than a diversion of resources. The company emphasizes that its Québec project continues to advance with offtake discussions underway.

What advantages does Texas offer compared to Québec?

While Québec offers exceptional renewable energy resources through Hydro-Québec, Texas provides advantages in terms of logistics, permitting timelines, labor costs, and proximity to growing U.S. battery manufacturing centers. The two locations complement each other strategically.

How does the facility address the ""lithium conversion gap""?

By adding significant domestic refining capacity, the project helps bridge the disconnect between North American battery manufacturing ambitions and limited regional processing capabilities. This addresses a critical supply chain vulnerability in the transition to electric vehicles.

What makes the copy-and-paste approach advantageous?

Replicating the proven Bécancour design reduces engineering time, lowers technical risk, and accelerates implementation. The approach allows for immediate adoption of tested purification systems and established supplier networks.

How does the project align with U.S. policy objectives?

The facility supports multiple U.S. priorities including critical minerals security, domestic manufacturing growth, and clean energy transition. It potentially qualifies for incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act and Department of Energy loan programs.

What are the specific regulatory advantages for domestic lithium refining?

Domestic lithium compounds avoid the 25% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports while qualifying for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. These policy measures effectively improve project economics compared to imported alternatives.

How will the facility source its raw materials?

The deep-water port location enables direct maritime transport of spodumene concentrate from various global sources, including U.S., Brazilian, and African mines. This flexibility reduces dependency on any single supplier region.

What happens if lithium prices decline from current levels?

The copy-and-paste approach minimizes capital costs while the strategic location optimizes operating expenses, creating a cost structure that remains competitive even in different price environments. Lithium industry tax breaks and policy incentives further buffer against market volatility.

Future Outlook for North American Lithium Refining

The lithium refining landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with several factors likely to influence future developments:

Technology evolution: Ongoing innovation in refining processes may create opportunities for efficiency improvements

Recycling integration: Growing volumes of end-of-life batteries will create additional feedstock sources

Market consolidation: Strategic partnerships and acquisitions may reshape industry structure

Policy developments: Executive order on critical minerals and other government initiatives will continue influencing investment decisions and project economics

These dynamics suggest a dynamic but favorable environment for well-positioned projects like the Brownsville refinery, particularly those able to execute efficiently and adapt to evolving market conditions.

For industry participants and investors, the growth of domestic lithium refining represents an important step toward more resilient and sustainable battery supply chains, reducing logistical complexity while creating economic opportunities in regions embracing the energy transition. According to Kalkinemedia's industry analysis, the lithium universe texas refinery plan illustrates how companies are strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on emerging lithium brine market insights and other supply chain opportunities.

For congressional progeny, that distance can be political or personal.
More than two decades later, she is known as a political maverick, with a voting record to match.
But she says that growing up it was her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, who was the presumed political heir.","Adelita Grijalva grew up seeing strangers approach her father, the late Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, who spent more than 50 years in elected office, including two decades as a congressman from Arizona.

“Anywhere we’d go, we’d go to a restaurant, the people would be standing there, staring.”

She and her sisters became a part of his entourage.

“We were, like, staffing him all the time: ‘Yeah, that guy wants to take a picture’ [or] ‘That lady wants to talk to you,’” she said. And he’d talk. “That’s just the way he was.”

Grijalva says her father modeled how to stay humble in office, a lesson she plans to put into practice once she’s sworn in to represent Arizona’s 7th District. But when that will happen still remains in question.

More than a month after winning a special election to replace her father, Grijalva has not yet been seated, the byproduct of rising Hill tensions amid a partial government shutdown. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has suggested she will be sworn in only when the government reopens.

Once she joins the 119th Congress, she will be among a growing list of lawmakers who followed their parents to Capitol Hill, bringing the total to at least a dozen. They include Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who was appointed by her father Frank H. Murkowski when he was elected governor. And House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, the daughter of powerful Baltimore Democrat Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., who served in the House from 1939 to 1947.

Candidates have congressional connections

Already more than a half-dozen congressional progeny are seeking office in the 2026 midterms, including Stefany Shaheen, daughter of New Hampshire Democrat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen; Jim Kingston, son of former Georgia Republican Rep. Jack Kingston; and Jake Levine, son of former California Democrat Rep. Mel Levine.

Pelosi has declined to confirm that her own daughter, Christine Pelosi, may run to succeed her. Asked whether she has advice for her or for Grijalva, she replied, “Well, my daughter … that isn’t anything that is a reality yet.”

Pelosi added, “In terms of Adelita, the advice I give all women who come here: be yourself, the authentic you, and know your power. ”

Political observers note the clear benefits of being a politician’s child while running for office.

“A huge barrier to entry for a lot of folks is access to certain networks and just simply name recognition,” said Casey Burgat, director of the legislative affairs program at the George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management.

At the same time, Burgat says, there’s the risk of being pigeonholed as a copy of your parent or associated with their flaws, pointing to New Jersey Democrat Rep. Rob Menendez, the son of former Sen. Bob Menendez. His father was well connected on Capitol Hill and chaired the Foreign Relations Committee before his political career came to an ignominious end. The senior Menendez was convicted in a sweeping corruption case in 2024 and is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.

“It’s tough to walk the fine line of ‘I’m going to be as effective as my father proved to be,’ and then all of a sudden you need to distance yourself,” Burgat said.

For congressional progeny, that distance can be political or personal. Grijalva says people have accused her in the past of parroting her father: “My dad always said, ‘You have to be the best prepared. You have to do your homework all the time. You have to know everything that’s going on, because people are going to discount you all the time.’”

Casting their own political identity

Stepping out of a parent’s political shadow can take some time. When Murkowski was first appointed to the Senate, her record closely resembled that of her father – a staunch conservative who almost always voted with Republicans.

More than two decades later, she is known as a political maverick, with a voting record to match. In 2024, she broke with the GOP on more than half of all party-line votes. Once limited to issues like abortion and judicial nominations, Murkowski’s split with Republicans has been felt on a broader range of issues in recent years, including homeland security and foreign policy.

Pelosi, who rose to become the first woman to be elected as speaker, is such a titanic figure in the House that her own father’s congressional tenure is almost a footnote to hers. But she says that growing up it was her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, who was the presumed political heir.

“I always was a volunteer in politics later in life, and then one thing led to another, but I never had any ambition to run for office,” she said. “[My brother] was the one that people thought would be in politics. … That was where the expectation was, never with me, and nor was it anything I wanted.”

Her father lived long enough to see her sworn in after winning a 1987 special election to replace Rep. Sala Burton, who died in office.

Levine, speaking from the campaign trail in California, says it took him time to embrace who his father was.

“There was a time in my life when … [I] would shy away from letting people know that my dad had served because I wanted to stand on my own two feet,” he said. “But after a while, I kind of realized that actually this was quite special.”

Levine says his father never pressed him to run for office and was so modest about his own congressional career that it was only recently that he learned of one of his biggest policy accomplishments. The younger Levine, then a White House energy and climate official, had accompanied President Joe Biden on one of his last trips to name Chuckwalla National Monument, near Joshua Tree National Park.

They were talking about the trip when his father casually dropped that he had written legislation that eventually became the 1994 law establishing Joshua Tree as a national park.

“I just felt so proud of that, but also I sort of joke with my dad that he, of course, never shared that with me,” Levine said.

For her part, Grijalva has followed closely in her father’s political footsteps: Both served on the local Tucson school board, and both were elected as Pima County supervisors.

But she admitted that the timeline didn’t always suit the elder Grijalva: “My dad wanted me to run for office when I was 18. I’m like, ‘I’m going to college.’”

Now Grijalva is eager to embrace her father’s legacy and has her eye on his committee assignments: Natural Resources and Education and the Workforce. And she is already talking about making some of his policy proposals her own, including a sweeping bill to classify some environmental regulations as civil rights concerns under the law.

With solar panels on 126 school building rooftops, New York City schools are central to the city and state’s green energy goals and generate the majority of solar energy installed on municipal buildings.

These solar arrays produce nearly 20 megawatts — enough to power about 24,000 city households — and make up roughly 80% of the overall solar power capacity from city buildings. They are also critical to achieving a local mandate of 150 megawatts of solar citywide by 2035.

Experts say school solar projects not only cut energy costs and reduce emissions, but also ease students’ climate anxiety and strengthen community resilience during emergencies. More than half of FEMA’s approximately 67,500 designated shelters nationwide are located in schools, making it more urgent to equip them with solar storage systems that can provide backup power during outages.

Solar has even entered the mayoral race: Zohran Mamdani has highlighted it in his green schools platform, one of the first education policies the mayoral frontrunner put forth.

But solar projects now face uncertainty under the “one big beautiful bill” signed by President Donald Trump in July. Under the law, federal tax credits that have incentivized and funded school solar initiatives are set to expire by the end of 2027, leaving districts scrambling to initiate and complete projects before the phaseout. Tax credits generally pay for 30% of installation costs.

It’s one of several blows to school systems that want to be more green, including cuts to federal grants for electric school buses.

Advocates are urging schools to start new solar projects before the end of this calendar year and finish by June 2026 — a window that would allow them to circumvent many of the new restrictions in the law that, they warn, could make it harder for schools to qualify for credits.

“ What I don’t want to have happen is for schools to unwittingly move forward, be counting on that credit, and then be surprised if one of these new rules trips them up,” said Sara Ross, cofounder of UndauntedK12, a nonprofit that supports K-12 public schools’ transition to clean energy.

New York City schools are pressing ahead on solar work, with an additional 90 solar projects in progress and another 200 schools under review for future installations, officials said.

“New York City Public Schools remains committed to sustainability and climate education for our students,” Education Department spokesperson Jenna Lyle said in a statement.

Department officials did not comment directly on the federal legislation, saying they are “monitoring this situation.”

To pay for the 126 school solar installations, Education Department officials said the city invested $30 million in capital funds and an additional $100 million through long-term power purchase agreements, an arrangement where private developers pay for installation of a solar system and schools agree to pay the developer for the electricity they use, typically over a long period of time.

Schools’ role in transitioning to clean energy

Although they account for just 1% of total carbon emissions in the United States, school buildings produce an estimated range of 41 million to 72 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to researchers at Brown University. They also consume a significant amount of energy.

In 2019, New York’s roughly 1,400 school facilities accounted for more than a third of all energy consumption across city-owned buildings.

The city’s Education Department already spends about $275 million per year on energy, a figure experts say is likely to grow as utility costs rise and aging school facilities face mounting stress from extreme weather tied to climate change.

But schools’ size — they make up 36% of all city-owned square footage — also make them ideal stewards of clean energy.

“Schools have a lot of land, they have a lot of assets,” said Ross. “When sunlight is hitting those every day, why wouldn’t we be harvesting that sunlight to reduce our costs?”

New York schools installed their first rooftop solar arrays nearly 20 years ago, Education Department officials said. But the program’s expansion didn’t gain momentum until 2021, with installations ramping up in the last five years.

The city is currently developing solar and battery storage systems at five schools in partnership with several city agencies. Among them are P.S. 48 and M.S. 424 in the Bronx, both of which double as emergency shelters.

Education department officials said they could not provide an estimate of how much money completed projects have saved to date, but added that in the long term, the city will have saved more than it has spent on solar installation. Ross said those savings can help schools afford other needs.

“ School budgets are tight, and fundamentally, solar is the cheapest energy around, so when schools install solar, they can reduce their operating costs,” Ross said. “That frees up more dollars to go back into their core mission — whether that’s improving other parts of their facility, having more dollars for student programming, and increasing teacher salaries.”

Karin Goldmark, founder of GreenLink Education, an organization that helps schools take climate action, noted that rising temperatures will contribute to higher energy costs.

“It’s worth it to do solar, particularly if you have 1,400 buildings and you’re paying energy bills for all of them,” she said.

Goldmark said that in the summer, when school buildings sit largely empty, they can sell excess solar power back to utilities, thereby providing clean energy that offsets the need for gas-fired plants.

“That’s an important contribution to the energy transition the country needs to make, and it generates revenue for schools in the process,” she said.

Funding school solar projects

Installing solar panels can deliver major long-term savings, but the upfront costs are steep and often out of reach for school districts, especially those that want to install large-scale solar projects like in New York City.

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed under former President Joe Biden, changed that by opening up clean energy tax credits to schools in 2022. Although schools are tax-exempt and cannot claim credits directly, an “elective pay” provision allowed them to convert those credits into cash reimbursements. That effectively created new funding for solar and other clean energy projects — with virtually no cap, Ross said.

“We have spent the last three years shouting this from every rooftop, going to conferences of superintendents and business officers and school board members and facilities leaders and really spreading the word about this massive opportunity to have the federal government defray the cost of these very energy and cost-efficient machines,” she said.

Now, UndauntedK12 and other clean energy advocates are working to educate schools on how to make the most of the tax credits before they disappear.

In addition to the narrow timeline for initiating and completing school solar projects, a process experts note can take years, “the one big beautiful bill” imposes a new set of restrictions schools must follow in order to qualify for tax credits.

One requirement, for example, mandates that a share of solar panels be sourced and assembled domestically.

Solar developer Jared Lang said that the rule is driving up costs, since domestic solar developers have long relied on imported materials after Chinese manufacturers flooded the American market years ago.

“All the new tax credit requirements forcing us to use domestically assembled panels are basically costing us about 50% more,” said Lang, who also owns Housing Sustainability Advisors, which supports affordable housing owners in moving to solar.

“It’s really going to affect how much solar we can build,” Lang said.

Ross said that while the expiration of tax credits will make the transition to solar more challenging, schools funded projects before the Inflation Reduction Act created new clean energy incentives.

She pointed to power purchase agreements as a longstanding, affordable method for schools to launch solar projects.

“There’s a path forward, even for districts that don’t have money,” Ross said.",https://www.chalkbeat.org/resizer/v2/NBPKFOUG2FFXBGIECUJPTFYKCQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=dd1774698d8a6a0e6ec13cd7206d0cbaa7fe8d22260cd43f34942c88088c272f&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-14 17:05:10.687914

Cancellation of Government Subsidies

The market for electric vehicles in the United States has come under pressure after the US government under President Donald Trump allowed federal tax credits for EVs worth 7,500 US dollars to expire. ""Given the recent policy changes by the US government, including the cancellation of certain tax benefits for the purchase of electric vehicles and the relaxation of emissions regulations, we expect a decline in the acceptance of electric vehicles,"" GM stated in the announcement.

Following the cancellation of government subsidies, GM will realign its electric vehicle strategy. GM has invested billions of US dollars in the electric car market. According to US news channel CNBC the company planned to invest up to 30 billion US dollars in electric vehicles by this year, including dozens of new models and battery production capacities. This is now being put to the test. The re-evaluation of its EV capacities and production sites is still ongoing, the automaker stated. This suggests, according to CNBC, that further costs could be announced in future quarters.

Ford with Billion-Dollar Write-off in 2024

GM's write-offs for electric vehicles come a little more than a year after competitor Ford shelved its plans for a three-row electric SUV and also wrote off a billion-dollar amount. Ford wrote off 400 million US dollars on product-specific assets and materials directly and additionally calculated further write-offs and costs of up to 1.5 billion US dollars in the following quarters.

General Motors, which offers the most EV models in the USA, has recently achieved significant growth in EV sales, but last year the EV market in the USA already grew slower than the non-electric market. This trend is likely to intensify after Trump's policy shift. In the short term, industry observers expect a sharp decline in electric car sales before a recovery eventually occurs.

With your partnership, it can continue to deliver cleaner energy, healthier air and stronger communities for the next 15 years — and beyond.","Fifteen years ago, MCE (known then as Marin County Energy) was little more than an idea.

A group of community leaders and advocates believed that residents deserved cleaner choices and a stronger voice in where their electricity came from. At the time, fossil fuels dominated California’s energy supply, and the only option for customers was the Pacific Gas and Electric Co.’s 13% renewable mix. Many said a small local public agency couldn’t possibly compete with the utilities, let alone lead a clean energy movement.

Fast forward to 2025, and the results speak for themselves. As a member of its Board of Directors close to 12 years, I’ve seen it firsthand. MCE — California’s first Community Choice Aggregation program — now serves nearly 600,000 customer accounts and 1.8 million residents and businesses across 38 communities in Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano counties. What started as a choice for a few thousand customers has grown into a model that has inspired 25 community-choice programs across the state, collectively serving one-third of Californians.

Since launching in 2010, MCE has surpassed California’s clean electricity targets years ahead of schedule. Today, all MCE service options are 100% fossil-free and our flagship Deep Green program provides customers with 100% renewable energy to serve their needs each year. My town of Fairfax has the highest percentage of Deep Green signups among MCE members, with 13.2%.

The results have been tangible: Together, we’ve eliminated over 500,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions — the equivalent of removing more than 116,000 cars from the road. Cleaner energy means cleaner air, healthier communities, vibrant local economies and meaningful progress in tackling climate change.

Even during turbulent times for California’s energy market, MCE has kept rates stable and competitive. Through sound financial management, it has earned A-range investment-grade credit ratings from Fitch Ratings and S&P Global. Those ratings, along with innovative financing tools like green bonds and prepay transactions, have saved customers millions of dollars while ensuring it can invest in the resources of tomorrow.

Since 2010, customers have saved over $70 million compared to PG&E. At the same time, MCE has built a healthy reserve fund, maintaining over 200 days of cash on hand. This figure is on par with utility industry best practices and is a significant driver of MCE’s investment-grade credit rating, which in turn allows it to negotiate more favorable renewable power contracts while maintaining stable rates.

What makes MCE different is that it is a not-for-profit public agency. Priorities are set by a board of local elected officials, not shareholders. That means when it succeeds, our communities succeed. Over the past 15 years, MCE has reinvested more than $400 million locally — funding renewable energy projects, providing bill relief for income-qualified customers, offering EV rebates and supporting workforce training that helps residents access well-paying clean energy jobs.

From solar arrays on former brownfields to battery storage at food banks and shelters, MCE projects deliver more than electrons — they deliver equity, resilience and opportunity. More than 7,000 green jobs in California have been supported through MCE’s work, and programs like its NextGen Trades Academy are helping underserved youth gain hands-on training in electrification and energy efficiency careers.

MCE has also made it easier for families and small businesses to participate in the clean energy economy. In 2025 alone, nearly 1,000 MCE customers received EV rebates at the point of sale, with over half used for pre-owned vehicles — proving that clean transportation can be affordable and accessible.

The years haven’t always been easy. There were skeptics in the early years, and today it still faces challenges, from rising energy costs to climate impacts. But through it all, MCE has shown that when communities come together, it can take on big challenges and deliver real results.

As MCE celebrates 15 years of service, I am deeply grateful to the customers, workers and community partners who have made this possible. Together, MCE has built more than an electricity provider. It has built a model for how local communities can lead California’s transition to clean energy while keeping costs competitive and reinvesting in the places we call home.

The story of MCE is still being written. With your partnership, it can continue to deliver cleaner energy, healthier air and stronger communities for the next 15 years — and beyond.

In a data centre boom in Mexico's Querétaro state, big tech companies are given leeway to bypass environmental requirements.

Querétaro state lets data centres skip environmental impact reports

Data centres also exempt from CO2 tax

Experts warn of effects on drought-stricken state

QUERÉTARO, Mexico - A data centre boom is gathering momentum in central Mexico, where the local government of Querétaro has made it easier for foreign big tech companies to bypass environmental reporting requirements and taxes, an investigation by Context has found.

A dozen data centres operate in the semi-desert state of Querétaro, with most of the massive warehouse-like structures built in the past three years.

Data centres can house thousands of servers used by big tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon for their storage services and the massive amount of data used in generative artificial intelligence tools such as Copilot and Gemini.

Most data centres in Querétaro, owned by companies such as U.S.-based Aligned Data Centers and Equinix, operate in industrial parks, locations that exempt them from providing environmental impact reports.

As such, Querétaro residents say when a data centre arrives, they are not informed about the potential effects on the water-stressed environment.

""This opacity prevents us, as citizens, from the possibility of having evidence of this industry's specific impact,"" said Paola Ricaurte, a professor at the Tecnológico de Monterrey University.

Communities are responding by demanding greater regulation and transparency about the water and energy that data centres consume.

Data centres use a lot of energy to run their servers and a large amount of water to cool them. In 2023, for example, all of Google's data centres consumed 6.1 billion gallons of water, according to the company.

""Without concrete evidence, we cannot defend our rights to health and information or have transparency on the decisions the government takes to benefit the industry,"" said Ricaurte, who is researching data centres' environmental footprint in Querétaro.

Marco Del Prete, Secretary of Sustainable Development, said data centres are not classified as an industry but as a service provider, which is why they are exempt from providing environmental impact reports.

""The data centre is a service company that doesn't process supplies or generate direct emissions. It doesn't need to obtain an environmental impact report,"" said Del Prete in an interview with Context.

A 2022 document issued by the Ministry of Sustainable Development showed that a data centre operated by Microsoft in Querétaro did not need an environmental impact report as its ""activities are not considered fixed sources of emissions.""

""There is obligation""

Lawyer Lorenia Trueba, a member of Voceras de la Madre Tierra, a local environmental group, said all data centres should issue environmental impact reports due to their high water and energy use.

""The state's environmental code mentions that any activity which can cause environmental impact - when there is any risk or possibility of an impact - there is an obligation to issue an environmental impact report,"" Trueba told Context.

Trueba also said Querétaro is bound by Supreme Court decisions and international treaties such as the Escazú Agreement, which establish communities' right to access environmental information.

""They can't say that the technology used in data centres doesn't have an environmental impact,"" Trueba said.

""Where is all the information that should be put on the table so that people, academics, scientists, authorities and companies can sit down and discuss it?""

No local or federal law in Mexico regulates the environmental requirements for data centres.

Gov. Mauricio Kuri is leading the drive to attract big tech to Querétaro, which already has drawn $12 billion of investment for new data centres from Microsoft, Google and Amazon.

President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in September that U.S. tech firm CloudHQ will invest $4.8 billion in a project to build six AI data centres in Querétaro.

Globally, data centre construction is being promoted from Santiago, Chile and Zeewolde in the Netherlands to Ekurhuleni in South Africa, where governments are offering financial incentives, according to the UK-based consultancy Computer Says Maybe.

In the United States and Brazil, local and federal agencies are cutting regulation, speeding up permitting processes and making land available for planned data centres.

Water shortages

AI is poised to increase the amount of water that data centres use, as its power-intensive processors have greater cooling requirements than do conventional servers.

Querétaro has been struggling with water shortages and strict rationing after four years in which at least one of its municipalities has been under drought conditions, according to a federal monitor.

In the past year, residents living near data centres told Context their taps run dry and they suffer frequent power cuts.

Without environmental disclosures by data centres, experts said it is impossible to determine how much water they are using or where precisely they are getting it.

""We're in a sea of uncertainty... there's no data on data centres,"" said Teresa García Gasca, former dean at the Autonomous University of Querétaro.

""A lack of transparency is always very serious and creates mistrust,"" she said.

Data centres built outside the confines of industrial parks, meanwhile, do provide information on their impact.

Ricaurte said some companies should not be allowed to bypass environmental requirements and override citizen concerns.

""We as citizens have the right to know exactly how they are operating and what's the possible impact they may have on health, on the environment, on the land,"" she said.

Tax exemption

Mexico is also making itself attractive to tech companies by exempting them from certain gas emission taxes.

Since 2021, Querétaro has levied a tax on companies as direct and indirect sources of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases in a bid to reduce greenhouse gases emissions.

But data centre companies are exempt because they are not considered fixed sources of direct emissions, according to Del Prete.

""The emissions that a data centre generates are indirect emissions that don't come directly from the operations of the data centre,"" he said.

Critics say the tax exemption for data centres also puts local communities at a disadvantage.

""Even if they are not the industry that generates the most polluting emissions, they do have an important impact due to the energy they require, which is already creating issues for the population,"" said García Gasca.

Look, here’s one bottom line: if we actually had to build enormous networks of AI data centers, the obvious, cheap, and clean way to do it would be with lots of solar energy.
This study empirically legitimizes doubts about the commitment of the industry to transition to low-carbon energy production.
In some cases, members now sell more electric than gas equipment, though across the industry gas is still the leader, Cunningham says.","Caveat—this post was written entirely with my own intelligence, so who knows. Maybe it’s wrong.

But the despairing question I get asked most often is: “What’s the use? However much clean energy we produce, AI data centers will simply soak it all up.” It’s too early in the course of this technology to know anything for sure, but there are a few important answers to that.

.

The first comes from Amory Lovins, the long-time energy guru who wrote a paper some months ago pointing out that energy demand from AI was highly speculative, an idea he based on… history.

“In 1999, the US coal industry claimed that information technology would need half the nation’s electricity by 2020, so a strong economy required far more coal-fired power stations. Such claims were spectacularly wrong but widely believed, even by top officials. Hundreds of unneeded power plants were built, hurting investors. Despite that costly lesson, similar dynamics are now unfolding again.”

As Debra Kahn pointed out in Politico a few weeks ago,

So far, data centers have only increased total U.S. power demand by a tiny amount (they make up roughly 4.4 percent of electricity use, which rose 2 percent overall last year).

And it’s possible that even if AI expands as its proponents expect, it will grow steadily more efficient, meaning it would need much less energy than predicted. Lovins again:

For example, NVIDIA’s head of data center product marketing said in September 2024 that in the past decade, “we’ve seen the efficiency of doing inferences in certain language models has increased effectively by 100,000 times. Do we expect that to continue? I think so: There’s lots of room for optimization.” Another NVIDIA comment reckons to have made AI inference (across more models) 45,000× more efficient since 2016, and expects orders-ofmagnitude further gains. Indeed, in 2020, NVIDIA’s Ampere chips needed 150 joules of energy per inference; in 2022, their Hopper successors needed just 15; and in 2024, their Blackwell successors needed 24 but also quintupled performance, thus using 31× less energy than Ampere per unit of performance. (Such comparisons depend on complex and wideranging assumptions, creating big discrepancies, so another expert interprets the data as up to 25× less energy and 30× better performance, multiplying to 750×.)

But that doesn’t mean that the AI industry, and its utility and government partners, won’t try to build ever more generating capacity to supply whatever power needs they project may be coming. In some places they already are: Internet Alley in Virginia has more than 150 large centers, using a quarter of its power. This is becoming an intense political issue in the Old Dominion State. As Dave Weigel reported yesterday, the issue has begun to roil Virginia politics—the GOP candidate for governor sticks with her predecessor, Glenn Youngkin, in somehow blaming solar energy for rising electricity prices (“the sun goes down”), while the Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, is trying to figure out a response

Neither nominee has gone as far in curbing growth as many suburban DC legislators and activists want. They see some of the world’s wealthiest companies getting plugged into the grid without locals reaping the benefits. Some Virginia elections have turned into battles over which candidate will be toughest on data centers; others elections have already been lost over them.

“My advice to Abigail has been: Look at where the citizens of Virginia are on the data centers,” said state Sen. Danica Roem, a Democrat who represents part of Prince William County in DC’s growing suburbs. “There are a lot of people willing to be single-issue, split-ticket voters based on this.”

Indeed, it’s shaping up to be the mother of all political issues as the midterms loom—pretty much everyone pays electric rates, and under Trump they’re starting to skyrocket. The reason isn’t hard to figure out: he’s simultaneously accelerating demand with his support for data center buildout, and constricting supply by shutting down cheap solar and wind. In fact, one way of looking at AI is that it’s main use is as a vehicle to give the fossil fuel industry one last reason to expand.

If this sounds conspiratorial, consider this story from yesterday: John McCarrick, newly hired by industry colossus OpenAI to find energy sources for ChatGPT is

an official from the first Trump administration who is a dedicated champion of natural gas.

John McCarrick, the company’s new head of Global Energy Policy, was a senior energy policy advisor in the first Trump administration’s Bureau of Energy Resources in the Department of State while under former Secretaries of State Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo.

As deputy assistant secretary for Energy Transformation and the special envoy for International Energy Affairs, McCarrick promoted exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and advocated for Asian countries to invest in natural gas.

The choice to hire McCarrick matches the intentions of OpenAI’s Trump-dominating CEO Sam Altman, who said in a U.S. Senate hearing in May that “in the short term, I think [the future of powering AI] probably looks like more natural gas.”

Sam Altman himself is an acolyte of Peter Thiel, famous climate-denier who recently suggested Greta Thunberg might be the anti-Christ. But it’s all of them. In the rush to keep their valuations high, the big AI players are increasingly relying not just on fracked gas but on the very worst version of it. As Bloomberg reported early in the summer

The trend has sparked an unlikely comeback for a type of gas turbine that long ago fell out of favor for being inefficient and polluting…a technology that’s largely been relegated to the sidelines of power production: small, single cycle natural gas turbines.

In fact, big suppliers are now companies like Caterpillar, not known for cutting edge turbine technology; these are small and comparatively dirty units.

(The ultimate example of this is Elon Musk’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, a superpolluter, which I wrote about for the New Yorker.) Oh, and it’s not just air pollution. A new threat emerged in the last few weeks, according to Tom Perkins in the Guardian

Advocates are particularly concerned over the facilities’ use of Pfas gas, or f-gas, which can be potent greenhouse gases, and may mean datacenters’ climate impact is worse than previously thought. Other f-gases turn into a type of dangerous compound that is rapidly accumulating across the globe.

No testing for Pfas air or water pollution has yet been done, and companies are not required to report the volume of chemicals they use or discharge. But some environmental groups are starting to push for state legislation that would require more reporting.

Look, here’s one bottom line: if we actually had to build enormous networks of AI data centers, the obvious, cheap, and clean way to do it would be with lots of solar energy. It goes up fast. As an industry study found as long ago as December of 2024 (an eon in AI time),

Off-grid solar microgrids offer a fast path to power AI datacenters at enormous scale. The tech is mature, the suitable parcels of land in the US Southwest are known, and this solution is likely faster than most, if not all, alternatives.

As one of the country’s leading energy executives said in April,

“Renewables and battery storage are the lowest-cost form of power generation and capacity,” according to Next Era chief executive John Ketchum l. “We can build these projects and get new electrons on the grid in 12 to 18 months.”

But we can’t do that because the Trump administration has a corrupt ideological bias against clean energy, the latest example of which came last week when a giant Nevada solar project was cancelled. As Jael Holzman was the first to report

Esmeralda 7 was supposed to produce a gargantuan 6.2 gigawatts of power – equal to nearly all the power supplied to southern Nevada by the state’s primary public utility. It would do so with a sprawling web of solar panels and batteries across the western Nevada desert. Backed by NextEra Energy, Invenergy, ConnectGen and other renewables developers, the project was moving forward at a relatively smooth pace under the Biden administration.

But now it’s dead. One result will be higher prices for consumers. Despite everything the administration does, renewables are so cheap and easy that markets just keep choosing them. To beat that means policy as perverse as what we’re seeing—jury-rigging tired gas turbines and refitting ancient coal plants. All to power a technology that…seems increasingly like a bubble?

Here we need to get away from energy implications a bit, and just think about the underlying case for AI, and specifically the large language models that are the thing we’re spending so much money and power on. The AI industry is, increasingly, the American economy—it accounts for almost half of U.S. economic growth this year, and an incredible eighty percent of the expansion of the stock market. As Ruchir Shirma wrote in the FT last week, the U.S. economy is “one big bet” on AI.

The main reason AI is regarded as a magic fix for so many different threats is that it is expected to deliver a significant boost to productivity growth, especially in the US. Higher output per worker would lower the burden of debt by boosting GDP. It would reduce demand for labour, immigrant or domestic. And it would ease inflation risks, including the threat from tariffs, by enabling companies to raise wages without raising prices.

But for this happy picture to come to pass, AI has to actually work, which is to say do more than help kids cheat on their homework. And there’s been a growing sense in recent months that all is not right on that front. I’ve been following two AI skeptics for a year or so, both on Substack (where increasingly, in-depth and non-orthodox reporting go to thrive).

The first is Gary Marcus, an AI researcher who has concluded that the large language models like Chat GPT are going down a blind alley. If you like to watch video, here is an encapsulation of his main points, published over the weekend. If you prefer that old-fashioned technology of reading (call me a Luddite, but it seems faster and more efficient, and much easier to excerpt), here’s his recent account from the Times explaining why businesses are having trouble finding reasons to pay money for this technology.

Large language models have had their uses, especially for coding, writing and brainstorming, in which humans are still directly involved. But no matter how large we have made them, they have never been worthy of our trust.

Indeed, an MIT study this year found that 95% of businesses reported no measurable increase in productivity from using AI; the Harvard Business Review, a couple of weeks ago, said AI “workslop” was cratering productivity.”

And what that means, in turn, is that there’s no real way to imagine recovering the hundreds of billions/trillions that are currently being invested in the technology. The keeper of the spreadsheets is the other Substacker, Ed Zitron, who writes extremely long and increasingly exasperated essays looking at the financial lunacy of these “investments” which, remember, underpin the stock market at the moment. Here’s last week’s:

In fact, let me put it a little simpler: all of those data center deals you’ve seen announced are basically bullshit. Even if they get the permits and the money, there are massive physical challenges that cannot be resolved by simply throwing money at them.

Today I’m going to tell you a story of chaos, hubris and fantastical thinking. I want you to come away from this with a full picture of how ridiculous the promises are, and that’s before you get to the cold hard reality that AI fucking sucks.

I’m not pretending this is the final word on this subject. No one knows how it’s all going to work out, but my guess is: badly. Already it’s sending electricity prices soaring and increasing fossil fuel emissions.

But maybe it’s also running other kinds of walls that will eventually reduce demand. Maybe human beings will decide to be… human. The new Sora “service” launched by OpenAI that allows your AI to generate fake videos, for instance, threatens to undermine the entire business of looking at videos because…what’s the point? If you can’t tell if the guy eating a ridiculously hot chili pepper is real or not, why would you watch? In a broader sense, as John Burns-Murdoch wrote in the FT (and again how lucky Europe is to have a reputable business newspaper), we may be reaching “peak social media.”

It has gone largely unnoticed that time spent on social media peaked in 2022 and has since gone into steady decline, according to an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries carried out for the FT by the digital audience insights company GWI.

And this is not just the unwinding of a bump in screen time during pandemic lockdowns — usage has traced a smooth curve up and down over the past decade-plus. Across the developed world, adults aged 16 and older spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms at the end of 2024, down by almost 10 per cent since 2022. Notably, the decline is most pronounced among the erstwhile heaviest users — teens and 20-somethings.

Which is to say: perhaps at some point we’ll begin to come to our senses and start using our brains and bodies for the things they were built for: contact with each other, and with the world around us. That’s a lot to ask, but the world can turn in good directions as well as bad. As a final word, there’s this last week from Pope Leo, speaking to a bunch of news executives around the world, and imploring them to cool it with the junk they’re putting out.

“Communication must be freed from the misguided thinking that corrupts it, from unfair competition, and the degrading practice of so-called clickbait.”

Stay tuned. This story will have a lot to do with how the world turns out.

A heat pump that can be installed in minutes is allowing the city of Boston to quickly decarbonize a public housing complex for the elderly and provide air conditioning as climate change-driven heat waves intensify.

The Boston Housing Authority on Wednesday will announce a pilot project putting small heat pumps made by San Francisco-based startup Gradient in a 50-year-old, 100-apartment building. The units fit in a window and can provide heating and cooling for a space of about 500 square feet. That replaces the complex’s inefficient electric-resistance heating and doesn’t require the expensive and disruptive renovations that accompany the installation of a centralized heat pump system.

This election might as well have been designed in a lab to test whether the national climate movement can rally attention and support around a key state race.

Third, this race is not only a preview of how the fight over electricity prices will play out, it is also a bellwether of broader political trends. Politico wrote of the race: “Republicans are hoping to use the election as a way to tamp down any Democratic optimism ahead of 2026.” As a state GOP strategist told the outlet: “For Republican voters, it is important to turn out because a win by Democrats will tell Democrats nationally that there’s blood in the water.”

The law introduces a new net zero target (2040 instead of 2045), binding emissions budgets for the city (to be reviewed each year) and a paragraph that says all climate policies have to be socially just. As far as we know a climate law like this is incredibly rare.

We fought for two years to make it happen, to win a public referendum is super rare and happens only once in ten years. As the German government is effectively boycotting climate action, this is an incredible sign coming from the citizens of Hamburg.

Federal officials indefinitely postponed a Wyoming coal lease sale scheduled for Wednesday, apparently in response to what many observers consider a lowball bid on another federal coal lease on Monday in Montana.

Navajo Transitional Energy Company, the only bidder, stunned coal market watchers with an offer of $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with its Spring Creek mine in southeast Montana — a fraction of a penny per ton and woefully low compared to past federal coal lease sales in the region. The last such major sale in the region, in 2012, netted $793 million for 721 million tons, or about $1.10 per ton, according to federal data.

An analysis of the energy assets of 250 of the largest oil and gas companies finds a marginal contribution to global renewable energy deployment and that renewable generation represents a tiny proportion of the total energy production of these companies. This study empirically legitimizes doubts about the commitment of the industry to transition to low-carbon energy production.

In some cases, members now sell more electric than gas equipment, though across the industry gas is still the leader, Cunningham says.

The precise settings on the induction stove mean Chan’s recipes can be carried out to exact specifications by his staff, with no room for interpretation as there would be with instructions like “a low flame.” “There’s less human error,” he says. “You can be more precise in a more foolproof way.

A team of archaeologists had surveyed the same area in 2023, also when water levels were low. However, they only spotted parts of the tombs.

This time, conditions were different. Iraq is in the midst of one of its driest years on record in nearly a century, according to Al Jazeera. Severe water shortages are threatening the country’s health and safety as water reserves have dwindled to just 8 percent of their full capacity.

+New report today from the folks at Reclaim Finance on why “coal transition offsets” are unlikely to work

The carbon offset industry has struggled with credibility issues since its inception. CTOs will face the same conceptual and methodological flaws as other offset categories, with their issuance managed by the same players that run the existing offsets market, and following the same processes. The core of the issue is the industry’s chronic inability to answer two basic questions: 1. Would the project have happened without offsets (is it “additional”)? 2. How many offsets should the project be allowed to produce? Analyses of both regulated programs and the voluntary offsets market show that, time and again, market players have answered these questions in a way which favors offset quantity over quality.

According to a comprehensive peer-reviewed study, less than 16% of all offsets issued up to 2024 are likely to represent real emissions reductions — suggesting that bogus offsets representing 4.4 billion tonnes of CO2 have been generated, an amount just under that of US fossil fuel CO2 emissions in 2023. A European Commission study of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the single largest source of offsets, found that only 2% of its projects had a high likelihood of being additional, while 85% had a low likelihood of representing real emissions reductions. Meanwhile, financial data company MSCI judges that three-quarters of voluntary market projects carry significant risks of failing to deliver claimed benefits.

+We seem to have passed a major global tipping point, raising temperatures past the point where significant numbers of warm-water coral reefs can be expected to survive, a new study has found

It estimates that coral reefs hit a tipping point when global temperatures reach between 1C and 1.5C above where they were in the latter half of the 19th century, with a central estimate of 1.2C. Global heating is now at about 1.4C.

Without rapid and unlikely cuts to greenhouse gases, the upper threshold of 1.5C would be hit in the next 10 years, the report says.

“We can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute. “The first tipping of widespread dieback of warm water coral reefs is already under way.” He said this was already impacting hundreds of millions of people who depend on reefs. The report points to reefs in the Caribbean, where marine heatwaves, low diversity and disease outbreaks have pushed reefs “towards collapse”.

+Another big new study shows that biofuels are indeed the disaster we’ve all long insisted. They not only don’t make things better than fossil fuels, they actually manage to produce more in the way of co2.

Global biofuels production emits 16% more CO2 than the fossil fuels it replaces, a new Cerulogy report on behalf of T&E shows. The same land could feed 1.3 billion people, while using just 3% of that land for solar panels would produce the same amount of energy. With demand set to rise by at least 40% by 2030, T&E calls for global leaders meeting in Brazil for COP30 to agree to limit the expansion of a climate solution that is doing more harm than good.

Today, growing crops to be burned as fuel uses up 32 million hectares of land - roughly the size of Italy - to meet just 4% of global transport energy demand. By 2030 this is set to grow by 60% to 52 million hectares - the size of France.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

WATCH: Why the red state of Utah is going green and embracing electric vehicles

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/2022-11-18T012108Z_988822127_RC2ZNX975E0F_RTRMADP_3_AUTOSHOW-LA-1024x691.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 17:06:27.280793

and Chief Sustainability Officer, Enbridge

(As published in POWER magazine on Oct. 7, 2025)

Here’s a fundamental truth: there is no AI without energy. And as the technology grows, its demand for energy, and carbon footprint, may never again be as small as it is today.

Against this backdrop, debates over which energy source should power AI miss the point. AI’s appetite for energy—relative to what the grid has available today—will demand every tool available. Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation. The real test is whether society can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers—and, at the same time, continuing to improve emissions intensity throughout the energy system.

Market participants are focused on how best to balance these considerations, and at a pace that will support America’s competitive advantages. Governments are also engaging.

The U.S. will need new chip factories, new data centers and, most critically, vast new sources of energy, along with the infrastructure to deliver where it’s needed. Recent reforms outlined in Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan aim to accelerate permitting and expedite infrastructure deployment, with the recognition that tomorrow’s energy system will look very different from the one we have today.

Bridging policy ambition with practical delivery requires companies capable of moving energy at scale, making infrastructure essential to the task. Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most. Our assets are strategically linked to major population hubs and positioned near the fast-growing data center clusters that will anchor the digital economy.

Being able to move the energy is only one part of the need. A diverse portfolio of energy businesses and capabilities—from natural gas transmission and storage, to gas utilities and renewable power operations—is crucial if we want to deliver a mix of energy sources that support clean energy ambitions while also ensuring continuous baseload power.

Here’s what that looks like in action: Earlier this year, Enbridge announced that it is developing and will be operating the 600-megawatt Clear Fork Solar project near San Antonio, providing clean and renewable energy for a customer.

On the Gulf Coast, advanced optimization projects, including a $50-million expansion of the Southeast Supply Header pipeline across Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are meeting the growing power needs of a major electric utility serving data centers.

There’s also the expansion of the Texas Eastern Transmission system to support the Homer City Redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania, which, when fully operational, will be the largest natural gas-fired power plant in the U.S. dedicated entirely to data centers and AI.

This mix of energy sources and innovation will help to match immediate energy needs with long-term growth projections.

Enbridge’s approach to the energy evolution must include:

lowering the emissions intensity of our operations;

helping customers transition from higher-emitting fuels to lower-carbon options; and

building more efficient and lower carbon infrastructure.

Since 2020, Enbridge has reduced GHG emissions intensity from our operations by 40%.

Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources—and robust domestic energy supply—planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging. Google recently offered data that punctuates this point: a median prompt to its Gemini model consumes 0.24 watt-hours—about the same as running a laptop for 17 seconds or a microwave for one second.

In June, Sam Altman noted in a blog on AI’s growth that the average ChatGPT query consumes about 0.34 watt-hours of electricity, roughly what a high-efficiency light bulb uses in a couple of minutes.

Numbers like these sharpen public understanding of AI’s energy appetite, but they also expose Jevons paradox—the dynamic where gains in efficiency lower costs, only to spark even greater demand.

For energy providers, that means data-driven planning and experience will be essential. Data centers will need partners that can deliver capacity, reliability and sustainability alike—baseload natural gas, renewables, storage and infrastructure built to meet real demand and support round-the-clock operations.

The paradox also makes clear what’s at stake: as AI expands, innovation will rise or fall on the availability and deliverability of dependable and flexible energy systems.

Meeting this moment will require unprecedented coordination between policymakers, hyperscalers and energy providers.",https://www.enbridge.com/~/media/Enb/Images/Stories/2025/October/Banner_ST_10_14_2025_AI_energy_hunger_1400x600.png?rev=e753ddc735324e5bb11574cea10cf7b4&hash=878B2DF47E95EF96CB07C1BA935C9984,N,,2025-10-14 17:05:54.977352

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act allocated money for clean energy vehicles, including electric school buses. It was supposed to last through the end of 2032, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended them at the end of September.

According to the Electric School Bus Initiative, Arizona districts had nearly 230 electric school buses committed, but only 49 that either have been delivered or are operating.

With the tax credit ending, those numbers — both in Arizona and around the country — may not see much increase.

Julia Gentin has covered climate education at The Hechinger Report. She joined The Show to discuss the status of states, districts and schools that were banking on being able to change out some of their bus fleets to electric?

Full conversation

JULIA GENTIN: Well, basically under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, schools were going to be able to have this tax credit for electric vehicles for the next seven years. So, it was set to expire in 2032. But now, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or H.R. 1, any electric vehicle that is acquired after September 30 of this year, 2025, will not be eligible for tax credits.

MARK BRODIE: So does that mean that there are likely going to be fewer electric school buses on the roads around the country than districts maybe had thought?

GENTIN: Yeah, for schools that have already purchased their buses but not yet received them, they are going to be OK and they can still continue to receive that tax credit because they've entered into this contract and purchased the buses. But for schools that have had considered for more long term, you know, adding the electric school buses, they will not be able to receive the tax credit if they haven't been purchased by Sept. 30.

BRODIE: Do you have a sense of how many buses or what percentage of electric school buses this might entail, in terms of districts that had been hoping to have them that will not be able to get them because they don't have the tax incentive anymore?

GENTIN: I would say I don't have a number on that, but the amount that it could affect per vehicle from the loss of these tax credits would be about $40,000. So for districts that were considering, or who had these in more of a long-term net zero energy-type resolution, they would not be able to count on federal funding anymore in that form.

BRODIE: What did some of the districts with whom you spoke for your reporting tell you that they planned to do?

GENTIN: Well, I talked to the Los Angeles Unified School District. So this is outside of Arizona, but they were at first really worried because the wording in H.R. 1 had initially been interpreted as ""buses placed into service"" and they weren't supposed to receive buses. They just got a notification that it was going to be before the first quarter of 2026, but they didn't know when they were coming.

So, they were really worried because they had already purchased these buses and were hoping to get the 30% of those costs covered by the Inflation Reduction Act-era tax credits. But then they thought that they couldn't anymore. The good thing is, on Aug. 15, there was sort of a rewording of that because I think the government realized there were a lot of districts in that same situation — where they had ordered the buses, but they hadn't come yet.

And that's something that Sue Gander at the World Resource Institute Electric School Bus Initiative was telling me — that there were a lot of school districts in that same situation that were stressed about when they would, they didn't know when they would get the buses. But luckily, the new Treasury Department guidance said, ""OK, for schools in that situation, as long as you purchase the bus, you'll be OK.""

For Tucson, though, in their school district, they had already gotten — I think — a 10-bus fleet. That was in Nov. 2024. So, that was through funding from the federal government, but a slightly different bucket of funding. It was the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program. But that, for most districts, only covered about two-thirds of the funding, and the remaining one-third was to be covered by this federal tax credit.

BRODIE: What are folks in the advocacy world supporting the adoption of more electric school buses saying about what kind of impact the loss of this tax credit might have?

GENTIN: Well, I think I said before this, but the loss of that tax credit could impact around $40,000 per vehicle. So, that means across the country there are more than half a million buses transporting 21 million kids to school. And there are all sorts of environmental impacts that come with these diesel- or fossil-fueled buses.

So, the hope was that the transition could continue, but now it's more of like, telling districts, ""you have to get these buses as soon as possible; otherwise, you won't be able to receive tax credits for them and you won't be able to electrify your fleet."" So, I think it will delay a lot of the electrification processes and the majority — this 90% of fossil fuel diesel school buses — will continue operating.

BRODIE: Does it seem as though advocates think this really is just a delay and not sort of the ending of this effort to electrify fleets?

GENTIN: It seems like districts still have hope and advocates still have hope that there could be some other funding sources that they look to to fill that gap. However, the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program, I believe, is expiring in two years. So that's, that's another setback. But for the portion that was covered by the clean energy tax credits, these federal tax credits, they are hoping to replace with either local sources of funding or state sources of funding.

But some states are more fortunate than others. For example, California has a lot of resources to fund electric school buses and electric vehicles, but some other states just don't have those resources.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/596f246/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5150x2704+0+1243/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F56%2Fd190939e4f8fb5bf7fdad76d2634%2Fjulia-gentin-20251014.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 17:03:53.057174

From the September / October 2025 Issue

Connecticut has long been a haven for original ideas and fresh thinking, and this drive toward the future has made the state home to acclaimed scientists, inventors, and creators, producing the first functional helicopter, anesthesia, and color television. Wide-ranging talent and a strong business ecosystem with access to major east coast markets make this New England state a strong location choice for both U.S.-based and foreign companies.

Globally recognized brands like ESPN, Xerox and Cigna have made their headquarters in Connecticut, as have startups like Yale University quantum computing spinoff Quantum Circuits, Inc. For companies both large and small, Connecticut has the talent and the business climate to fuel their growth.

Centrally located in the northeast U.S., Connecticut offers businesses a location adjacent to New York City, within two hours of Boston, and ease of access to markets throughout the U.S. and Canada. Along with three deep water ports and an international airport, Connecticut also boasts strong passenger and freight rail and interstate distribution networks.

The state’s robust infrastructure extends into energy and communication networks. And, whether it’s highway improvements, rail enhancements, or investments in EV charging stations, Connecticut prioritizes infrastructure resilience to support businesses.

Business Facilities recently spoke with Governor Ned Lamont, who took office in January 2019, about the latest for business and residents in Connecticut and his administration’s recent actions.

Business Facilities: When it comes to the business climate in Connecticut, what are highlights you’d share with site selection teams?

Governor Ned Lamont: Over the past two years, Connecticut has seen significant growth and expansion in our advanced manufacturing sector, which is a hugely positive sign. Our corporate investors are getting the workforce and support they need in our state, so they are doubling down on their investments.

We have also seen a rise in foreign direct investment as companies that supply our advanced manufacturing primes open operations closer to their clients. We had South Korea-based Hanwha Aerospace relocate its International Engines Business headquarters to Connecticut and Germany-based MTU Aero Engines expand their workforce, both doing so in part to better serve their major Connecticut customers, like Pratt and Whitney.

Connecticut is a low-risk location, and we value our corporate partners. Our companies see this support in tangible ways that benefit their businesses, so they value the partnerships and stability that our state offers.

These advantages have led to the investment and expansion of companies like semiconductor machine manufacturer ASML—arguably the most important player in the global microchip supply chain; mission systems, RF component, and advanced printed circuit boards manufacturer TTM Technologies; global cross-border payments fintech firm Banking Circle; and world-leading inhaled pharmaceutical solutions company MannKind.

BF: What incentives and other programs are being emphasized for new and existing business in Connecticut?

Gov. Lamont: Connecticut’s incentives are “earn as you grow” focused and bespoke, depending on the nature of the company’s operations. We do not offer broad incentives for all corporate investments and expansions but may assist those who can demonstrate a commitment to creating good-paying jobs for Connecticut residents.

We rolled out the Strategic Supply Chain Initiative earlier this year, which aims to support the growth and attraction of strategically important supply chain companies that contribute to Connecticut’s core industries. The goal of this program is to help companies increase their capacity to not only create more business for themselves, but also to promote onshoring and attract new supply chain operations, both domestically and internationally, to Connecticut.

BF: What is a key challenge or issue facing Connecticut in terms of business attraction and economic development? How is your administration addressing the issue?

Gov. Lamont: Despite having to compete with neighboring states like New York and Massachusetts, we see economic opportunities and advantages. Connecticut has made significant improvements over the past few years when it comes to net migration and the dynamism of our corporate ecosystem, alongside our continued, unparalleled access to top-tier talent and quality of life. We’ve been working tirelessly to sharpen our competitive edge through fact-based campaigns and policies that have increasingly been gaining traction on the national stage, resulting in new businesses moving and growing here.

Connecticut is small enough to make doing business here extremely easy. With an accessible governmental structure and responsive industry organizations, companies can be close to their customers throughout the mid-Atlantic and northeast—and even Canada—while ensuring they receive the support and services that they need to continue to grow. This is the true story of our state’s business environment, and it’s a reality that many companies in the industries of the future have bought into and thrived in. Few other states can offer what we offer in terms of workforce, quality of life, and location.

BF: What else would you share with businesses considering Connecticut?

Gov. Lamont: Business leaders shouldn’t rely on outdated perceptions. They should reach out and sit with our team from AdvanceCT and the Department of Economic and Community Development. Come see for yourself, because you’ll be missing out on an amazing opportunity if you don’t explore Connecticut’s assets. If you’re a company seeking a skilled workforce or manufacturing anything that requires immense precision, knowledge, and expertise, Connecticut is the answer to your business needs.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pg-45-photo-hanwha-gnl_web.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:02:02.860067

GM reported the loss to the Securities and Exchange Commission as what’s known as an impairment charge. Impairment charges reflect assets that are not expected to bring in profits as initially expected.

GM “made significant investments and contractual commitments in the development of electric vehicles (EVs) to help the Company’s vehicle fleet comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly stringent,” according to a company filing.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” according to GM’s filing. “These developments have caused us to reassess our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint.”

GM executives have continued to call electrification the company’s “North Star.” But, along with other EV makers, the company has been shaken this year by Republicans’ removal of a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers and lessees, as well as Trump’s efforts to pull back federal rules limiting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.

GM more than doubled its electric vehicle sales in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, largely due to drivers hoping to take advantage of the tax credits before they expired Sept. 30. Analysts predict a steep drop-off in EV sales in the coming months.

Interest in EVs among U.S. drivers, while increasing, is also doing so at a far slower pace than many in the industry expected.

The bulk of GM’s impairment charge — $1.2 billion — represents machinery and other equipment to make EVs that is now sitting unused.

The state Chamber of Commerce and Manufacturers Alliance will form South Carolina Manufacturers and Commerce, which will represent more than 900 business owners.

“At the end of the day, we’re just trying to find these views that help move South Carolina forward, for the people of South Carolina, for the businesses of South Carolina, and what will help take us forward into the future,” Hazzard said.
“What were once separate voices advocating for our state’s economic future will now speak in unison with better strength and clarity to tell the stories of the businesses that make South Carolina home,” Alexander said.","COLUMBIA — The state’s two predominant associations advocating for businesses’ interests are merging into one organization, leaders announced Tuesday.

The state Chamber of Commerce and Manufacturers Alliance will form South Carolina Manufacturers and Commerce, which will represent more than 900 business owners. The merger will officially take effect Jan. 1.

“Both organizations for decades have worked together on a variety of issues, and this was an opportunity to come together and build an organization that’s just bigger, better and stronger together,” said Sara Hazzard, who will lead the combined group.

The combined organization will build on major investments companies have made in the state in recent years, such as the $2 billion Scout Motors electric vehicle assembly plant just north of Columbia, said Hazzard, who has led the Manufacturers Alliance since 2018.

The two advocacy groups tossed around the idea of becoming one for years, but with the recent momentum, the time seemed right, Hazzard said.

The combined advocacy group is still hammering out the specifics of its policy goals, leaders said. At the top of the agenda will be pushes to reform the state’s taxes to be more competitive for business, increase access to affordable energy, reform the way lawsuits are handled, and ensure residents have the skills to enter the workforce, Hazzard said.

Applicants who have received a disconnection notice should immediately inform their utility provider that an EAP application has been submitted.","With the winter heating season frigidly creeping around the corner, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority (IHCDA) has announced the opening of the application period for its Energy Assistance Program (EAP), a vital resource for low-income households facing high utility expenses.

The program accepts applications from October 1, 2025, through April 20, 2026.

The federally funded program, known nationally as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), provides a one-time annual benefit paid directly to utility companies to help eligible residents manage their heating and electric bills. This assistance can be crucial for households at risk of disconnection or those already without service.

Understanding EAP eligibility

Indiana households with or below 60% of the state’s median income may qualify for assistance. Eligibility is determined based on the gross income of all household members from the most recent three-month period.

The following income guidelines, based on household size, will be in effect for the 2025-2026 program year:

1 person: $2,796 per month / $8,389 for three months

2 people: $3,656 per month / $10,970 for three months

3 people: $4,517 per month / $13,551 for three months

4 people: $5,377 per month / $16,133 for three months

5 people: $6,238 per month / $18,714 for three months

For each additional person, add approximately $860 to the monthly income limit. renters whose heat and electric costs are included in their monthly rent may also qualify for a benefit.

Officials emphasize that the EAP benefit is not intended to cover a household’s entire annual energy cost. Recipients should continue to pay their utility bills regularly to avoid falling behind. The benefit serves as a supplemental subsidy to alleviate the financial strain during the most expensive months.

How to apply for EAP

Prospective applicants have several options to submit their materials. They can apply online through a designated portal, submit a paper application by mail or apply in person by contacting their county’s designated Local Service Provider (LSP). These LSPs, often community action agencies like the MLK Center and John Boner Center, typically process all applications and determine final eligibility.

A critical note for residents of Adams, Blackford, Huntington, Jay, Randolph and Wells counties: a new online system, referred to as LITT, will be used for applications this year. These applicants must ensure they use the correct portal link, which will differ from the one used by residents of other Indiana counties.

The application season follows a specific timeline with key dates:

Oct. 1, 2025: Online applications open to the general public at 8:00 AM Eastern Time.

Nov. 1, 2025: Local Service Providers may begin scheduling in-person appointments, though appointments are not strictly required to apply.

Dec. 1, 2025: The statewide “Moratorium” period begins, offering protection from disconnection for eligible applicants.

March 15, 2026: The Moratorium period ends.

April 20, 2026: The EAP application period closes at 5 p.m. ET.

Consumer protections and EAP

A significant protection for Indiana residents is the winter moratorium law. From Dec. 1, 2025 through March 15, 2026, regulated utility companies are prohibited from disconnecting residential service for any customer who has applied for and is eligible for EAP. Applicants who have received a disconnection notice should immediately inform their utility provider that an EAP application has been submitted.

For households in a heating crisis — such as receiving a disconnection notice, already being disconnected or having a bulk fuel tank at 10% capacity or less — the response is accelerated. LSPs are required to provide a mitigating action within 48 hours. In life-threatening situations involving a disconnected utility and a documented medical need, the response time is shortened to 18 hours.

Post-application EAP timeline and appeals

Applicants should be prepared for processing times. For standard applications submitted without an in-person appointment, LSPs have up to 55 days to determine eligibility. After a benefit is awarded, it can take utility companies an additional 30 days to process the payment. For direct-pay benefits, it may take up to 120 days for a check to be issued.

If an application is denied or a benefit is calculated incorrectly, applicants have the right to appeal. The appeal must be filed in writing with the Local Service Provider within 30 days of the denial. The LSP is then required to issue a written response within 14 calendar days. IHCDA advises applicants to first appeal to their LSP before escalating the matter to the state authority.

For more information, to find a Local Service Provider or to begin an application, residents are encouraged to visit the official IHCDA website or contact the Community Programs team at eap@ihcda.in.gov. While the 211 helpline can no longer complete applications over the phone, it remains a valuable resource for information on other community assistance programs.",https://indianapolisrecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2158183627-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:02:08.382415

From politics and incentives to a Moore’s Law–like evolution in battery efficiency and charging speed, to fire safety improvements being designed into these vehicles, disruption remains the one constant. What does this likelihood mean for the intelligent future-proofer? Common sense. Reasonably, we can anticipate that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, even while they serve as a transitional solution, may have their role diminish over time.

In contrast, BEVs will go farther and charge faster at the DC Fast Level, but the demand to plug in while parked is sure to persist for many years to come. The percentage of parking spaces that need to be dedicated and the corresponding charging speed (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast) is not fully known today and is likely to increase over time. Worse still, politicians love misguided mandates, local fire commissioners have their own opinions, and headlines on this topic are frequently misleading. High-level takeaway: Take a market-based approach and ensure that flexibility is built in for the future.

Circulation and layout

The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is rapidly transforming what was once science fiction into an impending reality. Although the precise timeline for widespread AV adoption remains uncertain, the vehicles’ impact on parking design will be as profound as it will be subtle. What we can reasonably predict is that we will neither transition to a world where all vehicles are self-driving taxis, nor will we end up in an environment where our vehicles take us to our destination, return home, and then pick us up when we are ready to leave.

Thus, this evolution necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how parking facilities are conceived and operated. Once again, future-proofing requires us to look beyond the headlines and think practically about how we can adapt to new technology. The impact of AVs on urban landscapes will occur inside the parking garage, where drop-off zones will allow passengers to disembark on the entry level before the car departs and parks itself, waiting nearby to be summoned for the return trip.

VIPs will pay extra to have their vehicle stored by the main entrance, ready at a moment’s notice to take them to their next destination. At the same time, the economically minded will send their cars to the nether reaches of the parking garage and will have to remember to summon them a few minutes in advance of their departure. As with overstay fees at EV chargers, parking operators will start charging for dwell times in pickup and drop-off zones.

Unlike a human driver, an AV navigates and interacts with its environment through sophisticated sensors and algorithms, demanding a different set of design considerations. They include creating AV–friendly lanes and entry/exit points, where pathways are clearly defined, are potentially wider, and allow more gentle turning radii to facilitate seamless, automated access. Crucially, traditional human-readable signage and visual cues will be supplanted by the need for machine-readable markers and robust digital communication protocols, alongside supporting infrastructure, ensuring that AVs can reliably interpret their surroundings and execute maneuvers.

Beyond accommodating AVs themselves, future-proof parking facilities must also integrate designated zones for new mobility solutions. The rise of transit network companies such as Uber and Lyft has already demonstrated the need for dedicated pickup and drop-off areas, which means moving these activities from busy curbsides into more organized spaces.

Looking ahead, the mobility landscape is expected to diversify even further by incorporating shared autonomous vehicles, last-mile delivery bots, and micro-mobility options such as e-scooters and bicycles. A forward-thinking design will strategically reserve flexible areas within the parking facility to accommodate these evolving needs, transforming garages into dynamic mobility hubs that serve a broad spectrum of transportation demands.

The evolution of wayfinding

Just as parking facility layouts must evolve to accommodate autonomous vehicles, so, too, must the systems that guide users through these complex environments. For decades, wayfinding in a parking garage was a static, and often confusing, affair of painted arrows and cryptic signage, open entirely to human interpretation. Today, technology has profoundly transformed the user experience and moved beyond mere static directions to offer dynamic, real-time guidance for both human-driven and self-driving vehicles.

Although traditional signage remains a necessary component for redundancy and basic navigation, especially for human drivers, the game has undergone a fundamental change with the advent of digital systems. Digital signage, strategically placed throughout a facility, can provide real-time information on parking availability and pricing, and can even direct drivers to specific open spaces. This real-time capability is crucial for maximizing efficiency and reducing congestion. Furthermore, advanced parking guidance systems, using networks of sensors or cameras, can monitor every space in a facility to provide a level of granular detail that was previously unimaginable.

Such rich data can then be seamlessly fed to mobile applications, in-dash navigation systems, and—crucially—directly to autonomous vehicles. This sort of feed allows users—whether human or AI—to plan their entire parking journey even before they arrive, and to navigate the facility with unparalleled precision. The result is a significantly more efficient and less stressful experience for the user, coupled with a more optimized, profitable operation for the owner, as spaces are used more effectively and traffic flow is streamlined.",https://cdn-ul.uli.org/dims4/default/8620e3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/792x446+0+83/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-uli.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F48%2F6167a3a242b58e343d7ebb5862d1%2Fparkonomics-ev-charging-rgb.png,N,,2025-10-14 19:02:45.323230

Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.
Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina.
She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.
A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.
Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation.","U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.

Speaking at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center, Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02), the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and Partners for Environmental Justice to address concerns from local experts, community leaders and residents.

Whitehouse is in his fourth term in the Senate. He has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.

Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina. Rhode Island is subject to rain bursts — sudden amounts of precipitation in a short period of time — that can flood rivers and overwhelm sewage treatment facilities. The Ocean State also has rising sea levels, coastal storms, and erosion.

“Those are familiar topics to you here in North Carolina – upland river flooding from rain bursts and coastal erosion and storms tearing away at your coastal communities,” Whitehouse said.

Flooding, storm water, and storm control are familiar issues to Ross’s constituents in the second congressional district, she said, but they are less common in other parts of the state.

She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.

“It is a new [issue] to the North Carolina mountains and to many other areas in this country that are feeling the effects of climate change that have been spreading and worsening over time,” Ross said.

This raises costs for homeowners insurance, according to Whitehouse. He talked about insurance companies deeming properties too risky due to concerns with climate change, which then leads to increased rates for families.

A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.

“This is actually everywhere, and it opens a new era of a climate conversation that will give us the political power to solve the problem before it gets devastatingly worse,” he said.

Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation. He said the state now has the third highest rate of property insurance policy cancellations in the country.

In some coastal counties, more than one in 10 homeowners lost their coverage in 2023, he said.

“The message is clear: You can’t solve the insurance crisis without also addressing the climate crisis,” Crawford said. “Rising risk means rising cost, and unless we take action to make our communities more resilient and reduce the pollution driving these disasters, North Carolinians will continue to pay that price.”

Community members at the roundtable shared stories of losing a business in Chapel Hill due to flooding and neighborhoods being destroyed from Tropical Storm Chantal in July.

Others expressed concerns over policy, especially with cuts to resources like the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Flood Insurance Program.

Whitehouse said the NFIP “isn’t sound or fair now” and needs restructuring. Improvements should include better mapping, allowing people to know when they’re really at risk, and options for people to be able to get assistance to relocate before they have to rebuild their homes, he said.

“The whole program is failing right now, and so a very significant redo is required, but transparency and consumer options are two of the key pieces to make it right,” he told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4255-1-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 15:03:28.346260

But it's expecting a downturn with the tax credits gone, and without fuel economy penalties, it's no longer under the gun to keep growing its EV business.

On paper, General Motors should be the envy of the American automotive industry. It now sells more electric vehicles across more segments and price points than any other manufacturer, from luxury pickup trucks to, soon, the sub-$30,000 Chevrolet Bolt. It's been running second to Tesla in U.S. EV sales for some time now, and in the third quarter of this year, it easily passed the total electric sales it saw in all of 2024.

Despite strong electric sales this year, GM officials today said that without the EV tax credit, the carmaker is expecting far less demand than it's seen thus far. That means retooling its factories to avoid an excess of EV inventory it can't sell—as well as to make more profitable gas-powered cars.

""Following recent U.S. government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,"" the carmaker announced in a regulatory filing posted today. Like any publicly traded company, GM is required to list such unexpected charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ""These charges include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion as a result of adjustments to our EV capacity.""

GM announced another $400 million in charges ""related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments,"" bringing the grand total to $1.6 billion. The news was reported by Bloomberg and other outlets.

Put simply, these charges show that it's expensive for a big, global carmaker like GM to adjust what cars it's producing at its factories, and at what pace. So even with impressive EV sales—about 145,000 through Q3—it's anticipating a downturn when people can't take advantage of tax credits, and it's having to make some changes.

This whiplash is expensive. And ""whiplash"" is the best way to describe how car companies made big pushes for electric cars and batteries made domestically under the Biden administration. Those years brought America both the EV tax credit and stricter fuel economy rules that were driving a largely electric new-car market in this country by the 2030s. Then everything changed.

The EV market reality never quite lined up with carmakers' rosy projections, and even before Biden left office, sales were often uneven at best. The Trump administration then yanked the rug out from GM and every other car company operating in the U.S. As of Sept. 30, they'll no longer have the EV tax credit to encourage sales. And they'll no longer have to pay any fines related to fuel economy rules, but they will have to pay steep duties on electric models imported from other countries.

Granted, that doesn't give GM a pass to stick an LS3 engine under the hood of every family crossover it makes. The carmaker knows it faces a mostly electric future someday, and deep down, any executive there will tell you that it'll deal with fuel economy regulations at some point again. (GM President Mark Reuss elaborated on this and more on this week's episode of the InsideEVs Plugged-In Podcast, which airs Friday.)

But for now, it's able to slow down. And while some competitors are issuing fire-sale price cuts on their EVs, GM has said not to expect any ""irrational"" discounts.

Slowing EV sales is certainly bad news for combating climate change and air pollution in America. And if all carmakers in the U.S. also slow down on their EV-related R&D investments, it leaves them caught behind far more advanced newcomers, like China's auto brands. Yet this $1.6 billion charge is a reflection of the financial realities involved with planning for years of investments in one area, and then having the federal government completely reverse course.

The Trump administration has certainly been no friend to EVs. But administration officials have argued that ending the so-called ""EV mandate"" and effectively killing fuel economy rules will make cars more affordable. Given that the average new car price rose past $50,000 for the first time in September, and that automakers are dealing with staggering tariff costs—GM's own bill was $1.1 billion just in the second quarter—that seems rather unlikely in the short term.

It's enough to make you wonder who's actually winning in this scenario.

Opening the session, Stewart Maginnis, IUCN Deputy Director General, underscored the urgency: “The renewable energy transition will define the trajectory of our planet. We must build quickly to meet climate goals — but we cannot afford to sacrifice nature in the process. Energy security, climate stability, and nature conservation are not competing priorities, but interdependent imperatives.”

A global dialogue on energy, nature, and people

Speakers recognised the need for smarter, more inclusive planning as renewable energy deployment accelerates — growing by more than 15% each year.

Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change Adaptation, Energy, Environment, Meteorology, Geo-hazards and Disaster Management, Vanuatu, highlighted the nation’s goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity access by 2030, stressing that “citizens are key” to realising this vision.

Panama’s Minister of Environment, Juan Carlos Navarro, reminded the audience that “renewables are here to stay”. With nearly 78% of Panama’s electricity already from renewable sources, he called for massive investments in intelligent, AI-driven grids to meet surging global energy demand, including that from data centres. “We need grids that are smarter than we are,” he added, “to provide energy efficiently with minimal environmental impact.”

Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, IUCN Climate Crisis Commission Interim Chair, World Wildlide Fund Climate & Energy Lead, introduced the country’s guiding principle of “deploying by enhancing” — advancing renewables while strengthening ecosystem protection. He called for an “ecological transition” that connects environmental, energy, and finance ministries and rethinks fossil fuel subsidies and outdated contracts. “We are a tiny piece in a big machinery,” he said. “To succeed, we must reform governance, link biodiversity with energy policy, and bring people into the heart of this transition.”

From Japan, Wataru Suzuki, Director, Biodiversity Strategy Office, Nature Conservation Bureau, Ministry of the Environment, emphasised the importance of trust and community participation. “Our environment ministry is small,” he said, “but we must be smart — combining renewable and conservation targets and ensuring that local communities share the benefits .” Japan aims to raise renewables to 50% by 2040, but must navigate the challenge of balancing solar expansion with the protection of cultural landscapes.

Oliver Conz, Director-General, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany, shared lessons from one of the world’s fastest renewable transitions, underscoring the central role of spatial planning and strong biodiversity safeguards.

“Every dollar spent on planning is an investment in the future,” he said. “Protected areas are no-go zones. Everyone signing a permit must ensure they are not signing the extinction of a species.”

He also noted that biodiversity challenges predate renewables — and that clean energy is too often blamed for historical declines. “We must acknowledge this and plan renewables where they are most effective,” he said.

Accelerating the transition wisely

IRENA’s Deputy Director General, Gauri Singh, warned that while renewable deployment is accelerating by 15% each year, the “sleeping giant” is transmission — the vast expansion of electricity grids needed to connect new power to people.

“The glamour is in the solar farms and wind turbines,” she said, “but the real challenge is in the grids. Without communities, this is not a revolution that can be sustainable.”

Singh stressed the need for ministries of environment and energy to “speak the same language,” and called for greater attention to the full lifecycle of renewable infrastructure, including end-of-life management. She noted that GINGR will play a critical role in helping countries apply practical, nature-positive siting guidelines and governance models.

Across interventions, ministers agreed that the transition must not only be fast — it must also be fair, inclusive, and locally grounded.

Putting people at the centre

As Tinne Van der Straeten concluded: “The Swiss knife to break silos is to talk about people — by people, with people. That’s how we change hearts and minds.”

From Vanuatu’s communities striving for universal access, to Germany’s lessons in planning, the GINGR dialogue underscored that Nature- and People-Positive renewables are not a contradiction — they are the only viable path forward.",https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/gingr-final-photo.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 15:02:49.289955

“We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,” Buckberg said.
Realities for drivers According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge.
“That might be a problem.” At present, Buckberg said, most EV owners are also homeowners with access to at-home charging.
According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits.","Compared to gasoline-powered cars, electric vehicles can save money at the pump, produce less harmful emissions, and avoid high maintenance costs. Why then, are so few Americans switching to EVs? The main reason, according to Elaine Buckberg, senior fellow at Harvard’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, is the hassle of charging on the go.

In a recent talk at Harvard Kennedy School, Buckberg, a former chief economist for General Motors, explored the realities of commuting with an electric vehicle, and why the lack of charging infrastructure is preventing the shift in consumer behavior needed to reduce transportation emissions.

Transportation accounts for 28 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and light-duty vehicles like passenger cars account for a total of 17 percent.

“We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,” Buckberg said.

Realities for drivers

According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge. For most Americans, that’s an average week of driving.

But consumers aren’t thinking about their daily, or even weekly, habits when considering making the switch to an electric vehicle, said Buckberg. What car buyers want is a vehicle that can reliably take them on a cross-country trip should the need arise.

“What if some weekend, they needed to take both kids and drop them off in different places, one at a soccer match and one had, I don’t know, dance competition, and they were both long-distance,” she said. “That might be a problem.”

At present, Buckberg said, most EV owners are also homeowners with access to at-home charging. But public infrastructure — which would be crucial to expand EV ownership — is still spotty.

“So people who can’t charge at home, or maybe can’t also charge in their workplace, they’re really going to rely on public charging,” she said. “That’s generally city dwellers and renters.”

Publicly available chargers — including both Level 2, which take roughly three to five hours to reach a full charge, and fast chargers that can reach a nearly full charge in around 20 minutes — currently sit at around 61,000 across the country, according to Buckberg. That’s up from 46,000 last year.

“But not nearly keeping up with the stock of EVs,” she added.

For comparison, there are more than double the amount of gas-fueling stations in the U.S. — many with multiple pumps for use.

Buckberg added that there is little reliability in a charger working, and a lack of real-time data for drivers. According to her research, only 34 percent of charging stations share real-time data that apps like Chargepoint and PlugShare use to inform their users on where to plug in. On some of the highways her team has studied, the gaps in available data exceed 1,300 miles.

“There’s no one-stop app to find chargers, which means it can be hard to find out whether a charger is working,” she said. “Who’s responsible? Who do you tell when it’s broken? So they don’t get fixed.”

Potential policy solutions

Currently, the federal government is not prioritizing increasing EV purchasing, as has been a trend in recent years, she said. It has cut incentive programs, including tax credits and spending programs, to improve availability of real-time charger data for drivers.

According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits. Her research shows that universal real-time data on highway fast chargers would raise new EV sales by 6.4 percentage points in 2030 — or 3.5 million additional EVs on the road in 2030 compared to the status quo. That would grow the overall share of EVs on the road by 15 percent and in turn create a reduction in emissions of about 15 million metric tons, she said.

“Data transparency could cure range anxiety,” she said in her talk. “Imagine that you could go to Google Maps, you could go to Apple Maps, you could go to whatever is the killer new EV app, and you could get reliable information.”

But there is still hope, she said. In partnership with scholars Ari Peskoe, Carrie Jenks, and Eliza Martin at Harvard Law School, Buckberg’s team has developed example legislation for state governments that would establish common standards for EV-charging providers to increase the reliability of their data.

“No expensive federal investment or tax credits,” she said. “It’s a really cheap option at a time where we’ve got pullback of federal incentives that would raise the number of registered EVs.”

And, Buckberg said, having states take the lead would reduce resistance for charging providers that have not made sharing data a priority.

“From a state perspective, this could be justified because it yields benefits at very low cost,” she said.",https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/090524_Elaine_Buckberg_07.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:00:26.339621

While the school is pushing the full implementation further down the timeline, actions have been taken to begin the process of converting.

School administrators decided on purchasing some electric buses for the district following a second vote that was held in March 2025. This was done in partnership with the 2023 Environmental Protection Agency rebate program. This program allowed for 90% of associated costs to be covered. Reyda noted that the school purchased two electric buses during this time, which are expected to arrive sometime during this summer. The district has been partnering with both Young and Wright Architectural and Leonard Bus Company. These companies have been hard at work ensuring that the chargers will be ready at the district’s garage in time for the arrival of the buses, said Reyda.

However, the school will inevitably need to invest in many more electric buses to comply with changing regulations. In April 2022, the N.Y. state Legislature passed a budget that was signed by Governor Kathy Hochul. This budget created deadlines for transitioning to electric buses that state schools must comply with. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority stated that all buses purchased by 2027 must be zero-emissions buses, and that entire fleets must be zero-emission by 2035. N.Y. state took a vote in 2022 that overwhelmingly supported the Clean Air, Clean Water, And Green Job Environmental Bond Act. The bond act provided $500 million to schools to aid in the transition to zero-emission buses. These funds are dispersed through vouchers given out by the New York State School Bus Incentive Program.

The dedicated assistance has definitely allowed this transition to be more of a reality for smaller rural schools with less resources, but many schools may still struggle to perform a full replacement of their bus fleet by this deadline. Reyda noted that the district is planning to submit an electric bus waiver to delay the mandate. This waiver will allow for less than the full implementation by the required deadlines.

Reyda stated that the waiver is not yet available to be submitted, due to the ongoing creation of specific guidelines and eligibility requirements. The waiver is expected to be available by Dec. 31, according to Reyda. Upon the release of the waiver, the school will submit a request that Reyda said should grant the district a couple more years to fully replace the bus fleet.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.post-journal.com/images/2025/10/13214240/Electric-School-Bus-01-667x500.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 18:02:47.510288

As promised, the Trump administration and its congressional Republican allies killed off as many of the clean energy and EV incentives as they could after taking power in January. Ironically, though, the end of the clean vehicle tax credit on September 30 actually spurred the sales of EVs, as customers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-disappear $7,500 credit.

Predictions for EV sales going forward aren't so rosy, and automakers are reacting by adjusting their product portfolio plans. Today, General Motors revealed that will result in a $1.6 billion hit to its balance sheet when it reports its Q3 results late this month, according to its 8-K.

Q3 was a decent one for GM, with sales up 8 percent year on year and up 10 percent for the year to date. GM EV sales look even better: up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024, with nearly 145,000 electric Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and GMCs finding homes.

GM had hoped to finagle a way to extend the clean vehicle tax credit to its customers by buying them itself and then leasing them to customers. But strong opposition from Republican senator and car dealer Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) and his colleague John Barasso (R-Wyo.) saw GM scrap this plan beyond the end of October.

Around the same time, GM's audit committee approved the $1.6 billion charge due to expectations that EV adoption will decrease in the US. $1.2 billion is due to changes to its EV production capacity, and another $400 million is the cash impact from canceling contracts with suppliers.

It might not be the only time, either. ""The reassessment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint, including our investments in our battery component manufacturing, is ongoing, and it is reasonably possible that we will recognize additional future material cash and non-cash charges that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are recognized,"" the company wrote in its filing.

However, GM says that its strategic realignment will not affect the current EV portfolio, and it ""expect[s] these models to remain available to customers.""",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2165725341-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:00:56.015671

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

The Detroit automotive giant was one of the first to go big on EVs, announcing in 2021 that it would phase out gas and diesel cars globally by 2035. The announcement came shortly after former President Joe Biden took office pledging to boost EV sales. At one point it was planning to spend $30 billion on EVs by this year, including an all-electric lineup further down the track.

Now, things look very different. President Donald Trump ended federal tax credits that helped American buyers afford to buy expensive U.S.-made electric cars last month, while Chinese automakers have pulled off one of the fastest industrial takeovers in modern history by building about 70% of the world's EVs this year.

GM said Tuesday that about $1.2 billion of the charges were down to adjusting its EV capacity, but added that plans to address its manufacturing footprint are “ongoing”. That means it is “reasonably possible” that more costs could be on their way.

The other $400 million is down to cancelled contracts and settling other commercial arrangements linked to its EV investments, it said. Shares were down 1.6% in premarket trading.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

GM said last month that it plans slower output of the Chevrolet Bolt, and is also scaling back producing its Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, saying at the time that it is “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

Ford has also cut investment, dropping models and taking a $1.9 billion charge last year. Chief executive Jim Farley recently said the market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

The work aims to reduce costs, improve safety and environmental performance, and guide federal energy policy related to deep-sea reservoirs.

The project is a collaboration between UH, Texas A&M University and Louisiana State University, uniting three leading Gulf Coast institutions to address one of the region’s most complex engineering challenges. The project will be managed by the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station.

“This research will help shape future government and industry policies on how we responsibly manage deep-sea reservoirs.”

— Ganesh Thakur, director of UH Energy Industrial Partnerships, University of Houston

As the recipient of four out of six grants associated with this project, the UH team will lead a majority of the work under the direction of Cullen College of Engineering Professors Ganesh Thakur, director of UH Energy Industrial Partnerships, and George Wong, graduate studies director at the school. The total funding for the entire project — a sum of $1.9 million — was approved on July 31 as part of the OESI Technical Response for Urgent and Significant Topics initiative.

“This research will help shape future government and industry policies on how we responsibly manage deep-sea reservoirs,” said Thakur. “Our goal is to make offshore production more sustainable, cost-effective and safe, benefitting both the energy industry and consumers.”

Driving Innovation with Purpose

The three teams will use advanced simulation and statistical analyses to identify the most effective production strategies for deepwater oil reservoirs. UH will focus primarily on non-Paleogene reservoirs — save for Wong, who will examine Paleogene reservoirs alongside Texas A&M and LSU.

By refining how reservoirs are managed and reducing the risk of damage during extraction, researchers hope to extend the life of offshore resources while minimizing environmental impact.

“You want to maximize recovery without harming the reservoir,” Thakur said. “If we can do that efficiently and responsibly, it’s a win-win situation – we produce more energy, safely and at lower cost.”

Thakur noted that the everyday person may not notice the impact of this work immediately, but said that over time, these innovations could help lower the overall cost of oil production – benefits that may eventually reach people’s wallets through more stable fuel prices.

“People may not feel it initially, but if it increases the oil production in the U.S. and lowers the cost of production, then the cost of gas at the pumps may go down,” he said. “Looking at the big picture, it’s a small but very important ripple effect.”

(AP) — Federal officials rejected a company’s bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, in what would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed sale underscores a continued low appetite for coal among utilities that are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump’s attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week’s $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it’s unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden’s administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

Most power plants using fuel from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana and Antelope mine in Wyoming are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.

Spring Creek also ships coal overseas to customers in Asia. Increasing those shipments could help it offset lessening domestic demand, but a shortage of port capacity has hobbled prior industry aspirations to boost coal exports.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/68ee728127c521.84282797.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-14 17:06:53.627214

According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office, “Vegetation-related impacts to the power system are the most common cause of power outages in the U.S., accounting for more than twenty percent of incidents.” For many utilities, vegetation management is at or near the top of their O&M spending. Florida Power & Light Company’s 2023-2023 Storm Protection Plan states the utility will spend about $77 million per year on managing vegetation across 16,400 miles of distribution lines. Utility executives owe it to themselves and their rate payers and members to adopt a strategic approach to vegetation management.

“No one saves money on vegetation management by saving money on vegetation management,” says Dennis Fallon, executive director of the Utility Arborist Association. “Vegetation management needs to be thought of right out of the gate as one of the largest O&M line items for utilities across North America, maybe the world.”

A Systemwide Approach to Utility Vegetation Management

To reduce outages and save money, utilities must fund utility vegetation management, UVM, programs with a focus on their system instead of tamping down emergent conditions. A systemwide approach would include:

Funding consumer programs,

Deploying the latest pruning strategies, and

Increasing job site management.

Consumer Outreach

A couple of years ago, an investor-owned utility partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation to offer 1,000 trees to customers. Among the reasons the utility gave on its website for the program was that selecting the wrong tree can result in significant pruning, removal, or serious electric service interruptions. The program was an example of spending to educate customers about vegetation affecting power from outside the rights-of-ways.

Tech-enabled Strategies

Pruning strategies combined with technology like LiDAR, satellite imagery, A.I. and other software is also a lever for smartly deploying resources across a system. LiDAR can home in on areas where vegetation encroaches on conductors. Satellite imagery offers a wide-area view of dead or dying trees to help inspectors address hazards before they cause outages. The one-two punch puts crews where they’re needed most.

Job Oversight

The U.S. military often refers to technology as an enabler, something that supports human efforts rather than replacing them. JSM enables the work of UVM crews, helping them stay on task and budget. JSMs are in the field to liaise between contractors and a utility’s project manager. A JSM is the project manager’s eyes in the field and someone who anticipates what a crew needs to stay on task and budget.

“There’s always value in an independent review of anything,” notes Fallon. “If you have someone educated in vegetation management, who knows what confines the contractor, and understands the utility’s expectation, the extra eyes are valuable.”

A job site manager helps a UVM program manage its O&M spending, which, ultimately, helps rate payers or co-op members avoid bigger bills. Experts agree overseeing a project is about spotting what crews do well and encouraging more of the same. But a JSM also keeps tabs on what crews don’t accomplish, so they improve.

Cultivating Opportunities

Being strategic about UVM includes JSM (e.g., observing tree pruning), analyzing outage history, and investigating outages that could affect future practices and priorities. For instance, researchers analyzing circuits in North Carolina found that pruning the same section of line every three years versus four would reduce vegetation-related outages per month by 13 percent. A UVM team needs to go on the offensive by creating a strategy to secure funding and prove its worth. Armed with research, UVM program managers can show executives how, for example, putting crews into the field more frequently reaps benefits. UVM managers must have an exceptional understanding of outage history, whether that is outage frequency (SAIFI) or duration (SAIDI, CAIDI).

“Tree management decisions don’t typically manifest in reliability for three to five years,” adds Fallon. “Vegetation management helps with SAIFI, so that’s a key metric.”

Data of this kind is a foundation for the ROI of UVM. A UVM manager can tally up the cost per outage related to vegetation, especially outages outside normal business. They can then compare that to the price of proactively cutting a tree that LiDAR and JSM have identified as an imminent outage risk. With this data, managers can show the cost of delaying vegetation management.

Building a Case

The funding argument, in part, hinges on how much a utility avoids in costs by cutting a tree in 2025 and eliminating outages that tree likely will cause in 2025. While preventative maintenance has a cost, there is a countervailing cost avoidance. Putting a value on that offset is the UVM manager’s challenge.

A University of Connecticut study comparing 13 years of pruning using an enhanced tree pruning program versus nearby untreated rights-of-way found “treated conductors had storm outage rates that were 35 to 180 percent lower than the service-area’s average annual outage rate for untreated conductors.” While managers may question spending $5,000 to remove a pine tree that hasn’t fallen on a conductor, a UVM manager can present a business case for preventing the damage versus spending after the pine does fall. First, there could be an outage that lasts, say, 36 hours if the tree falls on a weekend night. There’s the cost of bringing crews in after-hours and, potentially, as much as $5,000 per day for traffic control. In some states like New Jersey, a police officer would be required, adding more expense.

Storm season can be a time for UVM managers to make a case for a systemic, technology-enabled strategy versus “hotspotting,” or targeted vegetation inspections and pruning of high-risk locations. With a systemwide strategy and oversight, crews can reduce the time they are called out for emergencies due to trees and limbs contacting feeders. For example, before switching to a systemwide vegetation management strategy, Minnesota’s Lake Region Electric Cooperative spent three times as much on hotspotting work. By switching to a systemwide UVM approach, the co-op’s cost-per-mile spending dropped from about $2,400 per mile to $500 per mile six years later.

Being Opportunistic

Selling the value of UVM requires vegetation management professionals who break down silos. They must cultivate good relationships across their organization. They must regularly meet with project managers to anticipate (and recommend) where UVM can play a strategic role. The alternative: Wait for a call to step into the middle of a project on an emergent, tactical issue.

For a utility to deploy a new UVM strategy, managers must take a preventative approach informed by oversight and regular reports documenting and photographing imminent threats. Technology can help inform a UVM strategy, but crews go into the field to do the work. And crews require JSM.

Running an exceptional UVM program requires managers (and JSMs) who look for the next opportunity. When utilities have routine in-person or virtual meetings to discuss projects, UVM managers need to be there. When meeting participants and project managers mention key phrases (e.g., new construction, reconductoring, expansion, or acquiring new land), a UVM manager or JSM should speak up and explain the vegetation management component.

“A vegetation manager needs to speak convincingly about the financial aspects of UVM,” reminds Fallon. “Utility leaders need to hear what they’re buying with vegetation management, whether that’s wildfire risk reduction or something else, and how vegetation management changes the utility’s risk profile.”

Spain, along with the rest of the world, has set self-imposed goals to achieve decarbonization. Solar power has emerged as the most practical and viable energy resource as the world transitions away from fossil fuels towards the renewable energy sector. What has emerged is a worrying trend that affects not only Spain but the rest of the world’s energy sectors as well.

The global approach to the energy transition has resulted in oversupply issues in the solar sector

Over the past few decades, the overarching consensus in the global energy market has been that the world needs to foster a more cooperative transition process that moves the world away from fossil fuels towards the renewable energy sector.

As the globe embraced the need to transition the energy sector, which has been echoed by the world leaders at a variety of events in the energy sector, the inevitable effect has been that the renewable energy sector would struggle to meet demand. In a proactive measure, the world’s solar manufacturers began to scale up production in preparation for an increase in demand.

It has now emerged that solar supply has overtaken global demand in the sector

The global solar sector has, for the past decade or so, been preparing for a significant increase in demand as the world transitions towards the renewable energy sector to accelerate decarbonization.

Those accelerated decarbonization goals have resulted in several nations assessing their needs and placing an increased importance on the solar sector. However, it now appears that the initial expectations exceeded actual demand as supply is exceeding demand in the solar sector. The result is that the number of hours in which solar power prices were zero or negative has increased, leading to market instability.

Spanish solar watchdog UNEF has reported an increase in negative or zero electricity prices

As Spain aims to align with the global narrative that calls for higher importance placed on decarbonization of the energy sector, the nation’s solar watchdog, UNEF, has reported that during the first eight months of 2025, solar energy producers experienced 693 hours with negative or zero electricity prices.

UNEF stakeholders have urged the Spanish solar sector to foster a reformative process that could positively affect the negative and zero prices that have emerged in the market due to supply exceeding demand.

“This issue and low and instabile capture prices show the urgent need for reforms to electricity prices.” – UNEF’s Jose Donoso

Spain echoed the consensus that exists in the global energy sector, which calls for an accelerated transition in the market. Spain set itself ambitious goals in its Climate and Energy Plan, and the evident zero and negative numbers in the solar sector have undermined Spain’s efforts to reach the self-imposed goals.

The nations of the world are breaking ground on massive solar projects that underline the oversupply issues existing in the sector at the moment.

The decision marks the 17th nationally-significant clean energy project approved by the government since July 2024 – enough clean energy to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes – getting Britain building and boosting energy security.

Solar is the cheapest form of power available for the country. The government’s approach is to maximise solar on rooftops, which families could save around £500 a year on their energy bills by installing solar panels.

The government is also consulting on mandatory community benefits for communities hosting ground-mount solar, meaning families who live near a solar farm would directly benefit through funding that can be spent on local priorities, like new education schemes, new grassroots football pitches or better transport links. Developers for the Tillbridge project have committed to ensuring the local community benefits from the project.

Businesses and families are still feeling the impact of the country’s reliance on volatile global gas markets, which helped cause the biggest cost-of-living crisis in memory, with the price of gas still 75% higher that it was before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The only way to protect bill-payers from future price shocks is to drive forward with clean, homegrown power that Britain controls.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: “Families across Lincolnshire and the rest of the country have seen their energy bills go through the roof as a result of our exposure to volatile gas prices.

I’m Jason Bordoff.
Jason Bordoff: I’m going to come to all of that, but just remind people again who may not know you or your background.
Jason Bordoff: Sort of, I guess you’re echoing what Peter Thiel’s quote, we wanted flying cars and we got 140 characters.
Jason Bordoff: Yeah, I mean it is partly I think not in my backyard and sort of a knee-jerk reaction.","Dan Wang: My view is that the US and China are going to be in competition for a long time. We should understand them not through whatever structural advantages, because I think it is quite easy to paint an ugly picture of China. If we take a look at demography and debt, and political problems. Yes, you can do that. But if you want to focus only on the problems of America, you could also paint a similarly negative picture about the robustness of our political institutions or the robustness of our economy right now, as well.

Jason Bordoff: Trade tensions between the US and China have hit a new high mark. After China announced plans to ratchet up its export controls of some rare-earths and magnets with strategic uses, President Trump threatened to retaliate with 100% tariffs, which would go into effect on November 1 or possibly sooner. But the competition between these two world powers goes far beyond trade disputes and tariffs. It’s a contest between fundamentally different approaches to governance, technology, and economic development.

China, of course, dominates critical supply chains for clean energy technologies. But many of the innovations that spawned those technologies were born here in the US. China builds, and governs through strong state control. The US innovates, but struggles to build.

How did these two nations develop such different capabilities? What does China’s dominance in manufacturing mean for American competitiveness and national security? And can the United States learn from China’s approach to building at scale without sacrificing democratic values and individual rights?

This is Columbia Energy Exchange, a weekly podcast from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. I’m Jason Bordoff.

Today on the show — Dan Wang.

Dan is a research fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover History Lab and studies China’s technological capabilities. He is the author of Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future, a New York Times bestseller. Dan was previously a fellow at the Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center and a lecturer at Yale University’s MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies.

Dan and I discussed his book, which casts China as an engineering state and America as a lawyerly society. We talked about how those orientations manifest in everything from public transit to advanced manufacturing to the rise of artificial intelligence. We explored immigration policy, talent retention, and whether the U.S.-China relationship is headed toward further escalation or a different future. And Dan explained why he thinks that despite these deep divisions between our governments, American and Chinese people are similar in profound ways.

I hope you enjoy our conversation.

Dan Wang, thanks so much for making time to be with us. Welcome to Columbia Energy Exchange and congratulations on the great book Breakneck. It’s getting tremendous reviews, nominations in the Financial Times and other places and congrats on all the success.

Dan Wang: Thanks Jason. It’s my pleasure to be here.

Jason Bordoff: So there’s so much to talk about. I feel like I have to start with a mea culpa because I have a law degree, so I feel like I’m part of the problem.

Dan Wang: Sorry, next podcast please.

Jason Bordoff: So for those listening who may not know why I just said that or have read the book yet, just sort of explain the frame you’re bringing to help think about the US-China relationship tensions right now and why lawyers are the problem.

Dan Wang: Yes, so I spent 2017 to 2023 living in China, working as a technology analyst at a global macro research firm, and it felt like a pretty momentous time to be in China when Donald Trump had just launched his first trade war. China was growing in technological capabilities and the centerpiece of my time was living through the entirety of Zero-COVID. I started feeling frustrated that we’re reasoning through the US and China with these 19th century political science terms like socialist and capitalist and neoliberal, whatever that means. I just wanted to have a new and inventive fun framing of the US and China. So China’s a country I call the engineering state because at various points in the recent past, all of its most senior leadership have had degrees in engineering of a very Soviet sort. They were trained in hydraulic engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, et cetera.

They build their way out of every problem. So China builds a ton of high-speed rail, bridges, roads, highways, homes, hyperscalers, solar, wind, nuclear, whatever. They treat the economy sometimes as an engineering exercise, pushing smart people away out of cryptocurrencies and consumer tech into semiconductors and aviation and clean tech. They also engineer the people. So I write extensively about the one-child policy as well as Zero-COVID in which the number is right there in the name. They get really literal-minded about treating society as just another building material to be torn down and remolded as they wish. I contrast that with the United States, which I call the lawyerly society because it seems like everyone who goes on to be president first has to go through the Yale Law School.

Jason Bordoff: You said five out of the last 10 presidents have attended law school and some huge number of the Politburo Standing Committee by contrast were trained as engineers, if I recall correctly.

Dan Wang: At one point all of them, all nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee were engineers. Of the earlier American presidents, first 16 US presidents from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln, 13 of them were lawyers. Within the Democratic party, it’s especially lawyerly. Every single presidential nominee to be president from the Democrats between 1980 to 2024 had a law degree. The issue with lawyers is that they block everything good and bad, so you don’t have stupid ideas like the one-child policy. You also don’t have functional infrastructure, I would say, almost anywhere in the United States.

Jason Bordoff: I’m going to come to all of that, but just remind people again who may not know you or your background. You were born in China, you’ve lived in Canada and the US, so just remind people about your journey and how you came to this work and the perspective it gives you on both of these societies.

Dan Wang: I am from southwest China, a province called Yunnan, which is pretty distant, far away from the more prosperous coasts. When I was seven years old, my parents and I immigrated to Canada. I grew up mostly in Ottawa and my parents and I moved to the US when I was in high school. We moved to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, so this is suburban Philly. I feel like I’ve spent about equal parts of my life between the US, China and Canada at this point. I used to work in Silicon Valley and part of the reason that I moved out of Silicon Valley was that I thought that too much of tech in California was focused on small problems like consumer tech and cryptocurrencies. The Chinese, when I moved there at the start of 2017, had just announced that they were working on things like Made in China 2025 segments. They really wanted to get great at solar, batteries, nuclear power plants and what the Chinese were up to just seemed to be on a much larger scale.

Jason Bordoff: Sort of, I guess you’re echoing what Peter Thiel’s quote, we wanted flying cars and we got 140 characters. Is that sort of the narrowness?

Dan Wang: That is one element of it. Yeah.

Jason Bordoff: Actually one of, I do a lot of cycling and I love that five-day bike trip you did through China. So that sounded like a great trip, but also a really interesting way to see the extent to which building in that country is happening, including in so many parts of the country that lots of people who travel there maybe less than before Beijing, Shanghai, but it’s much broader than I think people here appreciate about the scale of the building and the modernization.

Dan Wang: Yeah, I spent five days cycling through a province called Guizhou, which is also in China’s southwest, also very mountainous and far away from the prosperous coasts. Guizhou is China’s fourth poorest province. It has 15 airports, it has 45 of the world’s tallest bridges—the world’s tallest bridges, not China’s tallest bridges—and it has high-speed rail. As I was cycling through, I was thinking that, oh my gosh, China’s fourth poorest province has much better levels of infrastructure than California where I’m speaking to you now as well as New York state. These places don’t really have high-speed rail. These places don’t really have excellent airports. So there is something pretty remarkable that the Chinese have been able to build a lot of excellent infrastructure. This I think has also been a way to build political resilience into the Communist party because if you’re a resident of Shanghai or Guizhou, every year you’re getting more subway stations, you’re getting more parks, you’re getting better integrated into the high-speed rail network where you can take the train from Shanghai to Guizhou as I did. As physical dynamism has produced a better life around you, you also feel like the future will be better than today. Whereas if you’re living in a pretty static place, like many parts of the US—I guess San Francisco and New York have built a little bit over the past decades, but if your only exposure to a better life is a new coffee shop around the corner, I think that you don’t expect the future to be very substantially better than the past.

Jason Bordoff: You have that great sort of stat data point at the beginning framing this about the year 2008 when California voters approved a high-speed rail between San Francisco and LA and China began construction of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail line. Three years later that was done in China at a cost of $36 billion. I guess the latest estimate for a small segment of the line between San Francisco and Los Angeles is 2030 to 33, which I’m quoting your book, which means the margin of error for estimating when a partial leg of California’s high-speed rail will open is the same as the time it took China to build the entire Beijing-Shanghai line. I thought that captured, well I guess this broadly, not just your book, but the Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s Abundance book and this whole idea that it has become too difficult to build is all sort of captured in that. So what lessons do you take from that other than lawyers are the problem? Where does that take us in terms of the kind of reforms, the policy approaches that we need in the US?

Dan Wang: Yeah, I think that lawyers are partially the problem. They’re partially the solution. I think that first let me defend a little bit of the lawyerly society, which is that I think that lawyers are guarantors of some degree of pluralism and they are guarantors of rights in many cases. Let me be very clear, I think that the US should not become like China in order to build a lot of infrastructure. There are much better models to reach for. Countries like Spain and France and Denmark and Japan have built excellent infrastructure without trampling over the rights of people at about one-tenth of the cost of New York City’s Second Avenue subway or something. But I think the problem with a lot of lawyerly society is that I think lawyers fundamentally are servants of the rich. Now, there are many types of lawyers and there are many types of lawyers that defend rights, but among the most lucrative parts of the law are rich people suing each other or suing the government.

I think one big problem with, let’s say California, is that speaking to you from San Francisco, this area is the only part of the world that managed to create several companies worth over trillions of dollars and especially Apple and Nvidia are super profitable, gigantic companies today. You can’t create companies worth trillions of dollars without some degree of legal protection. America is a country that works really well for the rich. They feel comfortable about starting their businesses here. I think this is both a benefit and a problem. I think that the rich in America have a lot of power. There’s nowhere better in the world to be rich. You can pretty easily transmute some of your wealth into political influence if you’re rich in America. I think the problem with America is that it can’t work in the longer run if it benefits especially the rich.

If you’re a rich person in New York City, you don’t worry about high housing costs. You have these skinny skyscrapers overlooking Central Park that you’re able to buy apartment units in. You don’t take the subway to work, you don’t have to deal with a screeching loud metallic scream every time the subway rolls in. What I would really like is for the US to build a little bit more for the people—people who need more affordable homes, people who need functioning mass transit in order to get to work. That is a little bit more of what I want the US to be able to do.

Jason Bordoff: And if you’re avoiding mass transit because of the screeching, you’re probably in a vehicle that’s going to take twice as long to get where you’re going. So it’s kind of important for densely packed cities like New York to have that. Regardless, I will say for people who want to hear your thoughts a little more deeply on tech and Silicon Valley and what that US-China relationship means, I listened to a great conversation you did with my friend DJ Patil at the Commonwealth Club, which I would encourage people to listen to. I thought that was really good.

I want to come back to your point about political resilience as one of the things that emerges from this. Is there a limit to that? I mean the argument that we’ve seen some make, and you can tell me whether you buy into it or not, Hal Brands and people about peak China—when part of the way you’re maintaining political and public support is by this continued investment in building like housing. Is there kind of a limit to that if the economy can’t catch up? And for all the constraints of lawyers versus engineers, US economy has generally performed pretty well compared to China. So in the long term, do you get political resilience from this approach?

Dan Wang: There are always a lot of risks now. I think that one way to understand the Chinese experience is to deliver things that people want. So I mean it’s always impossible to interpret the public interest, but according to the public interest that’s interpreted by the Communist party, people want cleaner air and better parks and monumental projects. That might be right or wrong, but I do feel like plenty of people in Guizhou point to these bridges with pride. Plenty of residents of Shanghai really love it when they have new and better subway lines. Of course there are limits to China’s approach. China’s economy right now is not on very strong footing and that’s in part because of the government’s actions to channel so much investment into manufacturing rather than give people more disposable income through some degree of redistribution. I think that China’s youth unemployment is really high, long-term simmering demographic decline that China will have to deal with.

I think the most striking fact to me is that plenty of people want to depart from China. According to some statistics, something like 14,000 millionaires departed from China in the year 2023. They take themselves and their wealth out to Japan, Singapore, London, New York, whatever it is. There’s a lot of creative types who feel like journalists, filmmakers, artists who feel that the government is growing more censorious as it is, and they decide that they want to be in places like New York or Amsterdam or northern Thailand where they can be a little bit more free in pursuing artistic pursuits. Then there’s a class of people who are not necessarily rich, not necessarily very creative types who have decided to fly to Ecuador where they don’t need a visa and then walk across the southwestern American border with other Central American migrants. The US CBP is apprehending something like 40,000 Chinese nationals across the southern border in the year 2024 every single month. There’s plenty of people who don’t like the engineering. They don’t feel like they want to be socially engineered. Xi Jinping has echoed a line from Joseph Stalin that the communist party and the teachers may need to be engineers of the soul. I don’t know about you Jason, but I don’t like having my own soul engineered.

Jason Bordoff: That point you made about people wanting to depart for reasons of creativity, open society, economic opportunity—is that changing? Particularly I’m thinking with regard to the US given the posture we’ve seen, particularly this administration take, but the general hostility in the US-China relationship. We’ve had so many Chinese students who’ve come to American universities for so long and often stayed to start companies or contribute to companies. Is that changing? Is the US shooting itself in the foot in that way do you think?

Dan Wang: Yes, I think that it is definitely a question that many Chinese have about whether they want to stay in the US longer term. I think there are still plenty of Chinese who would move to the US given the chance, but if we take a look at some well-educated Chinese especially, I spend some time thinking about AI researchers in Silicon Valley. According to some of these publicly disclosed top AI researchers, many of them attended Chinese universities, many of them are Chinese nationals. Many of these people are questioning whether they want to stay in the US longer term. It could be as simple as the fact that San Francisco is not always a wonderful city and they don’t like walking amidst so many syringes in the streets. It could be that they’re really put off by Donald Trump’s rhetoric about how he feels about Chinese.

It could be that they just miss great noodles and they miss mom’s cooking. But this is kind of a fluid group of people and I’m sure a bunch of Chinese students who are struggling with staying in Trump’s America in part because they don’t like the politics, in part because the visa policies are shifting against them. Though they would love to stay, they cannot have any means to stay. I’m still really struck by this episode last month in which ICE conducted this raid on South Korean engineers trying to build a battery facility in the state of Georgia and deporting them and humiliating them in chains. I think that’s not the right approach for trying to build America into a clean tech superpower. China’s approach was to have a bunch of engineers from Apple and Tesla, welcome them with open arms, treat them really well so that they could teach Chinese to make some of the most sophisticated consumer electronics products in the case of Apple and most sophisticated EVs in the case of Tesla and to impart their managerial expertise and technical expertise into the minds and hands of Chinese workers. I’m wondering if this worked for China, why can’t it work for the US?

Jason Bordoff: I think there’s a perception from at least some in the US that China’s manufacturing prowess is in making cheap iPhones, it’s manufacturing at scale and lowering costs, maybe stealing IP, but it is real innovation too in the end. The companies that emerge like BYD or something, there’s extraordinary innovation happening there and I’m wondering if you feel like that is true and maybe not well appreciated enough?

Dan Wang: Yes, definitely. I think that there is this California mode of innovation in which you get a Steve Jobs, make him take a bunch of LSD, he goes into a garage and then a Mac computer rolls out. I think that is kind of a strange model of innovation and I think that the Chinese approach is much less LSD driven for sure. It is less of these light bulb moments and it is kind of just this incremental working on products in which progress is accretive and by the end of it, a much better product does come out. I think the challenge and the provocation I would offer to Americans is what has greater glory—is it to invent the solar cell as Bell Labs did in the year 1954? And in that case you get into the history books forever. Or is it to actually own this industry as China does?

Because China makes about 90% of solar photovoltaic panels, everything from the polysilicon processing all the way down to the assembly of the actual modules. I submit it is much better to own an industry rather than to invent it because otherwise I don’t think we’re giving that much credit to the British and the Germans anymore for inventing everything. It is much better to own these industries and America is really good at building a couple of ladders like reaching the top of the solar ladder, but it is not very good at actually climbing these sort of ladders because its firms are not very good at manufacturing anything anymore. I encourage Americans to treat manufacturing with greater seriousness and to figure out how to own these products that American scientists invent.

Jason Bordoff: So I want to ask you why that is and then also ask you why that matters—why it matters where we manufacture lots of things. But in terms of why that is, you said you don’t want to become like China. You mentioned the rights of people, maybe one-child policy, the way the state has orchestrated people’s lives, but in terms of becoming like China in the sense of engineering society, being able to manufacture at scale what you just said a moment ago, I presume you do want more of that. The question is what lessons you think we should learn from China? The idea of abundance has captured a lot of attention, but the question of how you do it—I mean environmental protections exist for a reason. There was a great builder here in New York, Robert Moses, who built lots of built New York for cars and put an expressway through the Bronx and almost through Washington Square Park. So environmental protections, community engagement, the things lawyers do serve a purpose, but if we’ve gone too far, what lessons can we learn about the right way to address that and fix that? Maybe we don’t go too far in the other direction.

Dan Wang: Yeah. Well let’s talk about China and I also have some thoughts about Robert Moses that I want to toss at you first. I think that there’s something that the Chinese deeply appreciate with technology production that the Americans have mostly forgotten. I think when I think about technology production, I think that it is made up of three different things. First, technology is made up of tooling and equipment. So these are pots, pans and a stove in a kitchen analogy. The second part of technology is written instruction. So patents, blueprints, something like a recipe. Third and most important, technology is process knowledge and process knowledge is what exists in people’s heads that’s impossible to write down. It’s what exists in people’s hands. You can also call it tacit knowledge, industrial expertise. It mostly lives on in communities of engineering practice. I think the United States was relatively relaxed about having Walmart ship a lot of goods into China throughout the 1990s.

There were some people who dissented against that, but broadly speaking, the elites gave the green light for American corporates to ship jobs to China. The US manufacturing population has declined, not mostly because of China. The economists tell us it is mostly because of technological automation, but a portion of that—American managerial expertise—really did move to China. I think the Chinese live and breathe technology production. They’re very intent on making really good products and they have a sense of how important it is to just keep knowledge alive and to keep it going. Technology is something that they practice and such that if you are just making a lot of great products, you don’t necessarily think too much about what’s going on in the mind of Xi Jinping. You don’t necessarily think about what’s going on in the mind of Donald Trump. You’re just solving three new problems a day before breakfast. Once you’re confronted with these challenges, you can move on to solve bigger and better challenges. This is a lot of the reason I think that the US no longer has the ability even to be very aware of what is important and valuable about new manufacturing processes. Now as promised, let me make a quick point about Robert Moses or do you want to say something?

Jason Bordoff: Well, I was just going to ask you about that. It sounds like if I’m hearing you right, the original sin in some sense was the embrace of globalization that things like tariffs or Buy America provisions to try to keep manufacturing at home, force people to do it here. Actually that’s part of the prescription you’re describing. Is that wrong?

Dan Wang: I think that there are several sins. There was no single original sin, but one part was a relatively relaxed attitude about moving offshore. I think that was downstream of this decision by a lot of investors to focus really only on the most profitable bits of technology production. So I mean Apple really is amazing at software and marketing and it has a lot of hardware experience, but a lot of that hardware experience is also shared. It’s mostly based in China. So I think that there is kind of also this sense that in China it is good to build manufacturing redundancies. In America the saying from someone like Tim Cook is inventory is evil. What we need is just-in-time production. So everything feels actually much more brittle and poised for perfection. What the Chinese have done is build much greater redundancies into the system. I think what we want is a little bit more focus on resilience rather than profitability.

Jason Bordoff: Okay. Robert Moses and then I’ll come back to what we were just talking about.

Dan Wang: Yeah, I think that first of all, The Power Broker is just one of the most amazing monumental books ever produced. I think it is an amazing work of biography. I read it last year along with a lot of other people in the 50th anniversary of the book, but I think it is also one of these books that produced the turn towards the lawyerly society in America, along with Jane Jacobs, along with Rachel Carson, along with Ralph Nader’s activism. I think it was definitely wrong for Robert Moses to ram so many highways into New York City in the Bronx and Sunset Park, and I think he certainly needed to have been stopped at the time that he was stopped. But I frankly don’t quite understand why it is that we in 2024, 2025 are still reading this book and feeling like it is still holding some of the answers of New York City development because the problem with the book is embedded in the subtitle: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York. Has New York fallen to me?

Well, the real estate prices haven’t fallen. It’s an extraordinarily expensive place to be. I spend a lot of time in Michigan. My wife is a professor at the University of Michigan, and if you want to take a look at fallen cities, come with me to the industrial Midwest. Places like Detroit and Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Pittsburgh has actually done better, but Cleveland and Detroit have obviously fallen much more. I think there are parts of Robert Moses’ agenda that I think have made New York into the gleaming city as it is today. He reorganized the southern part of Washington Square Park and gave that to NYU. NYU used to be closer to where you are in the part of town closer to Columbia. I think NYU wouldn’t be the university it is if it weren’t a little bit more central in Manhattan. Robert Moses built the Lincoln Center and what could be more elite than the opera and the ballet, but I think that New York City is a gleaming cultural center in part because it has that. So I think that we need a little bit of revisionism on Moses—recognize his mistakes but also recognize that he has done a lot of amazing things also for New York City.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, for sure. He was a master builder and a lot of the building was important and gave us the city we have today. We’re also living with the legacy of some things. Maybe in retrospect it would’ve been done differently, but the names you mentioned sort of highlight that tension. Right? Rachel Carson who famously wrote Silent Spring about DDT—through the forties and fifties and sixties was another great book by Douglas Brinkley, the American historian about the history of the American environmental movement where we partly in the spirit of building rapidly did spoil a lot of the air and water across the country and that led to landmark laws to be put in place to prevent that which are important. Also in my view and probably yours, have also been weaponized and gone too far and prevent sensible things from happening today. The challenge we have is sort of how to find the balance between those two things and get that right.

Can I ask about, you brought up energy, so let me sort of come to that a little bit in terms of the manufacturing capacity that China has, say, in solar PV and the dominant position that it has there. That’s true in batteries and electric vehicles, critical minerals refining and processing. We’re talking on the day that, and this will come out a couple of days after we talk, but President Trump threatened massive tariffs in response to China imposing restrictions on rare earths and magnet exports, highlighting a concern that many people have about the dominant position they have in these clean energy supply chains. On the other hand, if you think about something like a solar panel, climate is in my view, probably yours too, a very important challenge. We need to be moving much, much faster to deploy clean energy. If you want to move faster to deploy clean energy, you want it to be really cheap.

To the extent people feel like manufacturing needs to happen at home, buying things from China is a problem. The phrase national security is a label that gets thrown on everything now. All of that is difficult and inflationary and throwing up barriers to try to onshore or friendshore just makes things, I think more costly, causes delay. It takes a long time to build up the kind of supply chains China has. So I’m wondering how you think about the reason we’re doing this. You said a moment ago, we should have more manufacturing in the US. Is that because those are jobs that are good jobs and union jobs? Is that because as Jake Sullivan said, there’s a small yard of sensitive national security things that we want to make sure we have domestic capacity for military or other applications? Why do we care where all of this stuff is made and is it a problem to buy a lot of what we need in clean energy or otherwise from China?

Dan Wang: I think my view first and foremost of technology is that technology is like a ladder and if you miss a couple of rungs early on in the ladder, it becomes really difficult to climb up. This is a lot of what I mean by process knowledge. You have a lot of process knowledge in, say, workers who are making iPhones one year, they make a Huawei phone the next year, then they go make a DJI drone and an electric vehicle battery next. So they’re able to do these sort of things and move up the ladder. If you’re not on the ladder, then you can’t win these sort of industries. I think there is a national security argument in which, I mean just in terms of really direct national security goods like munitions now—what’s more national security than these sort of military goods? The US shipped a lot of munitions to Ukraine in self-defense against Russia.

I think that’s good, but then the US wasn’t able to build its stockpile very easily. So this is a way in which the defense industrial base is rusted and they need to get a lot better. I think there is also an economic resilience argument here where in the early days of the pandemic, the US wasn’t able to make relatively simple products like masks and cotton swabs. I think the US ought to be able to respond in any sort of an emergency. For me it is less important to create high-paying union jobs because I’m a little bit traumatized by some of these press releases from California high-speed rail. When the Chinese talk about high-speed rail, they talk about the number of people it’s moved. So in the first decade after the completion of China’s first high-speed rail line, Beijing-Shanghai, according to state media, China had completed about 1.4 billion passenger trips over the first decade.

When I see press releases from California high-speed rail, they’re always touting about the number of high-paying union jobs that this is supporting. I’m thinking the voters approved this referendum in the year 2008 to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles through high-speed rail. Will anyone be able to take this train from SF to LA 30 years after its completion? I’m not sure if we’re on track. So I think this is where I want the Americans to be a little bit more outcome oriented and not be so concerned about process and procedure. We actually need to do the things that the government says that it’s going to do.

Jason Bordoff: And give us a sense of how possible this is given that we missed some rungs in the ladder. When you think about something, again, the news of today, the position that China has in refining and processing the world’s critical minerals or making batteries or pick your thing, I do have a sense in which we have some government subsidies, some restrictions maybe on imports in the Inflation Reduction Act or other pieces of legislation. Then you see an announcement of a project here or there and people think, look, we can do it. We can manufacture these things at home. But the scale and magnitude of the dominant position China has really created is almost like staggering to comprehend and how long it would take and how difficult it would be to replicate that to meaningfully put a dent. People talk about diversification, want to diversify supply chains, but to bring in your areas of clean energy where the dominant position is 70, 80, 90% of manufacturing in many of the things I just talked about—to change that meaningfully, is that possible or is that like a scale of challenge at this point that is almost too difficult to tackle and then we need to think maybe about other policy tools to build resilience?

You could have strategic stockpiles, we can go down the list of other things one can do besides try to make things at home instead of importing them, but give us some sense of the scale of what it means for China to be dominant in these industries and how hard it is to replicate that.

Dan Wang: I am a sunny optimist from California, but I am not especially optimistic in this case. As a technology analyst in China, I was covering China’s capabilities in semiconductors as well as clean tech. Just thinking about the degree of China’s solar advantage, about 90% of the solar supply chain is Chinese. In part that is because processing polysilicon as well as other critical minerals is so energy intensive and polluting that only the Chinese have the stomach to do these sort of things. Cancer rates for some of these critical mineral refineries are just off the charts in the towns where these things are based. China is making frankly better electric vehicles at a cheaper cost than the Americans and Germans and the Japanese are able to do. They are deploying—according to, I just saw this on Ember Research—I think that China’s on track to deploy about 500 gigawatts of solar this year, and the US is on track to produce 50. So just one order of magnitude difference, and they just seem to be much, much more serious about solving a lot of their energy needs. What’s striking is that by the end of this year, one in two cars sold in China will be electric. I’m not sure what the ratio is in the US. Do you know—is it over 10%?

Jason Bordoff: Just over 10%.

Dan Wang: Okay. So the Americans is about one in 10, the Chinese is one in two. I think the technocratic seriousness comes in which they know that they need to import a lot of Middle East oil and gas to power their gasoline vehicles. But if they’re electric then they could be powered by domestic coal, domestic wind and domestic solar and domestic nuclear. So they have a much more serious sense of energy sovereignty than the Americans. What have the Americans been up to? Well, Donald Trump calls wind and solar the scam of the century. Maybe they’ll do more nuclear. Maybe the Trump administration will do more nuclear, but I’m not sure if it is actually on track to do so. With the Biden administration, it was also really slow and plodding and lawyerly, and this felt like industrial policy as conducted by Yale Law School where they were not actually fundamentally interested in the outcome. It was so procedural and they simply did not build enough even after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Right after they lost the election, Donald Trump is now in office threatening to cancel a lot of these different projects. I think this is where I would challenge parts of the left to question, is this about union jobs or is this about deployment of clean tech? What I think we should do is to focus a little bit more on the outcomes here rather than the process of trying to build.

Jason Bordoff: And tell me again in terms of the dominant position in manufacturing for maybe not the most advanced semiconductors with sensitive military applications, but technology broadly like solar panels or something, maybe batteries again, why we care. In that sense, how you think about the way China thinks about its dominant position and what it is using that for. We saw, as I mentioned a moment ago, restrictions announced this week on rare earth and magnet exports. Is the view here on both sides of the aisle that the US-China relationship is in a state now where there is a significant risk to this dependence because China will weaponize it? Do you think that is a view shared in China? Is that the intent of building this dominance—to weaponize it?

Dan Wang: Let me tell you that this is not a view that’s shared in China. This is a certainty in China because they can very well say that the United States was way earlier in weaponizing its economy against China. We don’t need to get into finger pointing about who’s to blame. That’s not a very interesting exercise. But I did live through the first trade war Donald Trump launched in China, which quickly morphed into the technology war in which the US government started adding all of these Chinese companies onto obscure blacklists in which Chinese companies, most notably Huawei, found that they could no longer procure American semiconductors. For several of these companies, their entire supply chain collapsed because some office in the Department of Commerce says no more American semiconductors for you. So I would say that the Americans have been showing the Chinese their weak spots and their vulnerabilities over much of the past decade to the considerable pain and suffering and distress of a lot of Chinese companies.

China is really paying back the US only at the start of this year when they started controlling the exports of rare earth magnets, which devastated a lot of automakers and a lot of clean tech producers. So I think that is certainly one reason to care. Another reason to care is that you shouldn’t give up on technologies of the future, that you should keep continuing to climb various technological ladders. Yet another reason to care is that I think that there is an important resilience argument here as well, that you should be able to train your workforce to be able to respond in an emergency if an emergency comes.

Jason Bordoff: You probably saw President Trump’s response to the China announcement earlier today in which he said, well, for every restriction they can put in place, we can do two, I’m paraphrasing—or the US has a far stronger monopoly, we have more weapons to use against them than they have against us. That was basically the point of his message. Is that true? Where does the US have a pretty weak hand to play here in terms of trying to think about the threats posed by the dominant position China has on a lot of these critical technologies?

Dan Wang: I think it is probably true, but I say let’s not find out. I think that when you bring up this analogy of hand, one of the earlier remarks from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the early days of the trade war was that America has a super strong hand. They’re playing with a pair of twos and we’re playing with a pair of aces. This was based on this theory that ultimately what matters is the market. If the Americans don’t buy from you, then your economy collapses. I think the Chinese and I believe in an alternate theory, which is that it is actually the goods manufacturers which have the much greater advantage here. If your critical goods suppliers do not wish to sell to you, then your economy might have pretty substantial problems as well. What was really striking to me was that China does have a lot of these chokeholds over the US and they were relatively restrained early on in the trade war.

They only stopped the export of rare earth magnets. They could have done a lot more. They could have stopped the export of a lot of electronics products. A lot of pharmaceuticals are almost entirely Chinese, I believe—fermented antibiotics as well as ibuprofen. So they only squeezed one finger and they could have squeezed much harder. Now obviously the US could squeeze harder itself, could block more semiconductors from going to China. It could block more aviation jets from going to China. It could heavily sanction China through the Department of the Treasury. But I feel like we should not get into this escalatory spiral in which these two countries attempt to destroy each other’s economies. I think that would be disastrous for everyone because then we can start contemplating about the possibility of hot war and we really shouldn’t get anywhere close to that.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, the risk of escalation, the tension in the relationship now, it seems to be growing. I’m wondering if that’s where you think things are headed now. I thought it was for all of that conversation we just had and all the difficulty and dangers in the US-China relationship, I was struck that you started off the book by saying, I am sure that no two peoples are more alike than Americans and Chinese. What did you mean by that and what does that portend for a different sort of future?

Dan Wang: Yeah. Well, myself, I am a cool, calm, collected Canadian going through these two big countries. They feel maddening and thrilling and fundamentally bizarre. I feel like a lot of Europeans and a lot of Japanese are quite alike. There’s a sense of coziness, there’s a lot of perfectionism. Their cities are much more beautiful than I think American and Chinese cities. But Chinese and Americans have a sense of hustle. They appreciate the technological sublime. They really want to become great powers and they want other countries to listen to them and they take shortcuts. I think what Chinese and Americans share is just that companies are really hungry. They want profit, they’re willing to make tradeoffs, and the American government and the Chinese government both also have a raw hunger for geopolitical power. They really, really want power in a way that I think you don’t really see this so much among the Europeans or again, the Japanese. So there’s much more that unites these two countries in terms of similarity, which is probably why they’re so directly competitive with each other.

Jason Bordoff: And I just want to come back to the question I asked you earlier about sort of where China is in its growth and its evolution now. Because again, there have been various articles written about so-called peak China—that China is nearing a point where it’s going to be difficult to sustain its economic growth and economic competitiveness. Is that where you think things are as there’s only so many cities of cement and steel, only so many bridges and buildings you can build? At a certain point once you’ve stimulated the economy with all of that engineering you talked about, is it nearing the apex of that and does that portend a slower outlook for the economy and maybe political challenges?

Dan Wang: No, I think that my view is that the US and China are going to be in competition for a long time, that we should understand them not through whatever structural advantages, because I think it is quite easy to paint an ugly picture of China. If we take a look at demography and debt and political problems, yes, you can do that, but if you wanted to focus only on the problems of America, you could also paint a similarly negative picture about the robustness of our political institutions or the robustness of our economy right now as well. My view of the competition is that I think that neither the US nor China are going to implode and then fail to get back up. I think that the more ahead that one country looks, the more the leader will make mistakes out of overconfidence and then overstep.

The more behind that the other country feels, they will work harder to reform themselves, to be more competitive. I think both countries have done superb jobs of hurting themselves and hobbling themselves. I think that is going to be a challenge with both of them. Now, I also want to be clear that I think that China will not replace the US as the global superpower, largely because the US is also a financial superpower, cultural superpower, diplomatic superpower. The engineering state will never, for example, become a financial superpower because they are insistent on capital controls. So you can’t be a global financial power if you insist on capital controls. But I think there is one area in which China is set to succeed because they’re engineers—they’re going to win on advanced manufacturing. I think that there will be a second China shock against American manufacturers.

Right now America has 12 million manufacturing workers. Could I see that dropping? Yeah, I can imagine a scenario in which that number of manufacturing workers halves over the next 10 years because of various problems. I think that even if the Chinese win on this fairly narrow victory of manufacturing, it could be the case that as the US loses more manufacturing workers, the economy and the industrial Midwest weakens, I think our politics will get worse. So this is kind of the big scenario that I’m worried about—worse economy, worse politics too because of manufacturing loss.

Jason Bordoff: You may not have sort of looked carefully at the energy outlook, but I’m wondering if what you just said sort of relates to it in the sense of how dramatic the growth in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions have been in coal use. One objection you often hear when people suggest the US should move faster to decarbonize is, but look at China, look at how much coal they use—half the world’s coal. But that outlook is changing. Coal use is maybe plateaued in China. It’s kind of flatlining. Renewables are still growing pretty strongly and I’m wondering if that’s partly about policy or climate or otherwise, but also just structural changes in the economy. As I said, very energy intensive or coal intensive, steel, cement, building and building all the bridges and buildings and cities—at a certain point that starts to plateau and change towards something like advanced manufacturing. Maybe that changes the energy mix as well.

Dan Wang: Yeah, I think it’s definitely both structural as well as political. Last I checked about 60% of China’s total energy use is still driven by coal. That is a really high share, but it is definitely the case that it seems like oil dependence has stopped growing. So both coal as well as oil has stopped growing at least. I think that’s in part because the Chinese are reacting—the Chinese government is reacting to people’s demands to have cleaner air. So that is definitely very positive. As I mentioned, the Chinese are reading all of these CSIS or American reports saying that, oh, China has all these vulnerabilities through the Straits of Hormuz or Straits of Malacca in which they can’t have oil. The Chinese say, oh, well maybe that’s right. Which is why now one in two cars sold in China is electric and so they want to be using domestic power. So part of this is a natural slowdown in the Chinese economy. Part of this is to respond to the citizens’ demands for cleaner air. I think part of it is a very real geopolitical, geostrategic element to say let’s have real energy sovereignty in which the Chinese seem much more all of the above on energy than frankly Donald Trump does. All of the above except for wind. That’s weird.

Jason Bordoff: He does not seem to be a fan of wind, although we do need a lot of power and it’s probably going to need to come from lots of sources, particularly. Well, it relates to what you said earlier actually. You mentioned AI and we haven’t talked too much about it, but the broad frame of competition to win an AI race, is that sort of the right way to think about it? Where is China in this race? How advanced is it, and how will sort of the coming age of AI affect some of the dynamics you just talked about in the US-China relationship?

Dan Wang: The US is still definitely in the lead on AI. They have compute capacity represented by advanced chips. They have the better reasoning models and they have a lot of amazing talent. But I say don’t count China out. I just wrote a piece that came out yesterday in the Financial Times outlining how China could win on AI. My case is that partly due to electrical power, China right now has twice the electrical capacity as the US and maybe that gap will grow even larger because they’re building so much more solar and nuclear, and the US is not. There’s a lot of Chinese students and Chinese researchers who are doubtful of staying in Trump’s America, especially if a trade war between these two countries escalates. I wonder what AI is going to be used for between both the US and China. The US is much more of a lawyerly society and maybe we’re going to use all the AI to produce even more lawsuits, and the Chinese is much more manufacturing driven and they’re going to use AI to produce more electronics, to produce more munitions and to produce more wind turbines as well.

Maybe just let me make one more note about wind and the lawyerly society. I think one of the more radicalizing stories I heard about wind was the story of Cape Wind. Now I’m thinking about wind because you have a scale model of a turbine behind you, but Cape Wind was made up of a bunch of wealthy landowners in Nantucket or Martha’s Vineyard hiring top lawyers, including a top Harvard law professor to say, we should not have wind because it will ruin the sight of our coastline and we need to save the whales too. This is one of the sins of the lawyerly society. Progressives are saying, not in my backyard, not in my coastline. They’re able to hire incredible lawyers to get what they want. So this is where I am doubtful that the lawyers have the right answer here.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, I mean it is partly I think not in my backyard and sort of a knee-jerk reaction. There was a little panel at Aspen Ideas Festival this year on the book Abundance and Mark Dunkelman’s—I’m blank on the name of it, but in that vein, another great book.

Dan Wang: Why Nothing Works.

Jason Bordoff: Yes, correct. Also a great book. I thought it was a good comment when there was a lot of support in the crowd for this idea. The moderator, Fareed Zakaria sort of noted, everybody who’s working in the buildings at this conference needs to live an hour away because it’s pretty hard to build housing anywhere near the town of Aspen for reasons. So that’s sort of the point you’re making—that people like that idea in theory, but maybe not in their backyard. There’s another dimension to it, which is environmental groups have spent a very long time trying to protect fisheries, trying to protect the oceans, and if we want to have a lot more clean energy, there’s a dimension to which you need to industrialize the oceans for energy and there are very few sources of energy that don’t have trade-offs, whether that’s mining critical minerals in Nevada or putting wind turbines offshore. The question is, how do we think about these tradeoffs that don’t paralyze us, but allow us to make some choices and move forward?

Dan Wang: I think yes, I think that’s a good encapsulation. There are always tradeoffs and don’t be paralyzed. I think that’s a great motto.

Jason Bordoff: Well, that’s a great note to end on. I really recommend the book Breakneck to people. Fantastic read and just great to see all the accolades it’s getting, shortlisted for Business Book of the Year in the Financial Times. I’m torn because one of our own scholars here at the Center on Global Energy Policy, Eddie Fishman’s great book Choke Points is also vying for that prize. Maybe it’ll be a tie and you can both win, but well—

Dan Wang: Eddie Fishman’s Choke Points is an excellent book and I shall be very happy if Eddie wins with that.

Jason Bordoff: Breakneck is great. Encourage people to read it and really appreciate your taking time to help us think through all these issues here on the episode today.

Apple is significantly expanding its clean energy projects across Europe with new large-scale solar and wind farms now in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Romania. Together with a newly operational solar array in Spain, the projects announced today — all enabled by Apple — will add 650 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to electrical grids across Europe in the coming years, unlocking more than $600 million in financing. This will generate over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean electricity on behalf of Apple users by 2030.

As part of the company’s Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is enabling renewable projects to address the electricity European customers use to power and charge their Apple devices. By 2030, Apple plans to match 100 percent of global customer electricity use with clean electricity by bringing new wind and solar power online around the world. The growing portfolio in Europe marks a significant step toward that goal.

“By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent.”

Product use — the energy it takes to charge and power Apple devices — accounted for about 29 percent of Apple’s overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2024. To address these emissions, Apple supports renewable energy projects that maximize impact on grids around the world, aiming to avoid the carbon that’s emitted by charging and powering Apple devices. The company’s strategy to address these emissions accounts for where Apple products are used, while aiming to protect communities and biodiversity, and prioritizing projects in grids that currently have higher carbon intensity.

Across Europe, Apple is facilitating the construction of large-scale projects that will add around 3,000 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy to the grid each year by 2030. In Greece, the company has signed a long-term agreement to procure power from a 110MW solar project owned and operated by HELLENiQ ENERGY. Now fully operational, the project will support Greece’s transition to renewable energy. In Italy, Apple is supporting the development of a 129MW portfolio of solar and wind projects. The first project — a solar project in Sicily — will come online this month.

In Poland — home to one of the most carbon-intensive grids on the continent — Apple has enabled Econergy’s 40MW solar array, which will be operational later this year. Apple also plans to procure power from Nala Renewables’ 99MW wind farm in Romania’s Galați County through a long-term agreement originated by OX2, which is now constructing the project. And in Latvia, Apple has signed one of the country’s first corporate power purchase agreements with European Energy. Through the long-term deal, Apple will procure electricity from one of Latvia’s largest solar farms to date, which will add 110 MW of clean power capacity to the grid once complete. Apple also enabled the development of a 131MW solar farm developed by ib vogt in Segovia, Spain. The project became operational earlier this year.

UPDATE

Apple expands renewable energy projects across Europe

New solar and wind projects will add 650 MW of renewable energy capacity to match the electricity European customers use to power Apple products

Apple is significantly expanding its clean energy projects across Europe with new large-scale solar and wind farms now in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Romania. Together with a newly operational solar array in Spain, the projects announced today — all enabled by Apple — will add 650 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to electrical grids across Europe in the coming years, unlocking more than $600 million in financing. This will generate over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean electricity on behalf of Apple users by 2030.

As part of the company’s Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is enabling renewable projects to address the electricity European customers use to power and charge their Apple devices. By 2030, Apple plans to match 100 percent of global customer electricity use with clean electricity by bringing new wind and solar power online around the world. The growing portfolio in Europe marks a significant step toward that goal.

“By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent.”

Product use — the energy it takes to charge and power Apple devices — accounted for about 29 percent of Apple’s overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2024. To address these emissions, Apple supports renewable energy projects that maximize impact on grids around the world, aiming to avoid the carbon that’s emitted by charging and powering Apple devices. The company’s strategy to address these emissions accounts for where Apple products are used, while aiming to protect communities and biodiversity, and prioritizing projects in grids that currently have higher carbon intensity.

Across Europe, Apple is facilitating the construction of large-scale projects that will add around 3,000 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy to the grid each year by 2030. In Greece, the company has signed a long-term agreement to procure power from a 110MW solar project owned and operated by HELLENiQ ENERGY. Now fully operational, the project will support Greece’s transition to renewable energy. In Italy, Apple is supporting the development of a 129MW portfolio of solar and wind projects. The first project — a solar project in Sicily — will come online this month.

In Poland — home to one of the most carbon-intensive grids on the continent — Apple has enabled Econergy’s 40MW solar array, which will be operational later this year. Apple also plans to procure power from Nala Renewables’ 99MW wind farm in Romania’s Galați County through a long-term agreement originated by OX2, which is now constructing the project. And in Latvia, Apple has signed one of the country’s first corporate power purchase agreements with European Energy. Through the long-term deal, Apple will procure electricity from one of Latvia’s largest solar farms to date, which will add 110 MW of clean power capacity to the grid once complete. Apple also enabled the development of a 131MW solar farm developed by ib vogt in Segovia, Spain. The project became operational earlier this year.

The company’s disclosure is one of the clearest indications yet that United States automakers are scrambling to adapt their production plans in response to slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

The EV market also faces fresh strain after the administration of US President Donald Trump scrapped a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, a key industry support, with auto executives warning of a sharp near-term drop in battery-car sales before an eventual rebound.

In a filing, GM said it expects “the adoption rate of EVs to slow” following recent policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and reduced emissions-rule stringency.

“The charge is a special item driven by our expectation that EV volumes will be lower than planned because of market conditions and the changed regulatory and policy environment,” GM told the Reuters news agency in a statement.

Carmakers are also working to cushion the impact of Trump’s tariffs, which forced GM to take a $1.1bn hit in the previous quarter.

The company has estimated a bottom-line impact of $4bn to $5bn this year from trade headwinds and said it could take steps to offset at least 30 percent of the blow.

“The charge doesn’t come as a surprise given recent market developments and the fact GM had made probably the most aggressive EV push of any traditional automaker,” said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.

“We think the automakers who chose to invest more heavily in hybrid vehicle development, such as Toyota and Honda, are poised to benefit in the US auto market.”

More charges

Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a programme that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans.

The carmaker warned of possible further charges as it reassesses capacity and manufacturing footprint.

The changes will, however, not affect GM’s current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs that are in production.

Charges include a $1.2bn non-cash impairment tied to EV capacity adjustments and $400m for contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements.

GM said the charges will be recorded as adjustments to non-GAAP results for the third quarter, scheduled for early next week.

On Wall Street, the automaker’s stock is trending higher despite the disclosure. As of 11am in New York (15:00 GMT), it is up by about 1 percent.

The green transition is no longer a distant goal; it is a present economic reality shaping industries, investments, and jobs. Across every sector, from energy to transport and agriculture, sustainability has become both a growth driver and a workforce challenge.

Globally, the shift toward low-carbon economies is expected to create 100 million new green jobs by 2030. For Kenya and East Africa, this transition presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity. With over 90% of its electricity already generated from renewable sources, Kenya is uniquely positioned to become a continental leader in green innovation, renewable energy, and the blue economy.

But realizing this opportunity requires more than policy, it requires people. Kenya’s future workforce must be trained not just for employment but for sustainability-oriented industries that will define the next era of economic competitiveness.

1. The Global Surge in Green Jobs

A $10 Trillion Opportunity

The green economy is now one of the fastest-growing segments of global employment and investment. The ILO (2024) estimates that the transition to renewable energy, sustainable manufacturing, and circular economies could generate 100 million new jobs globally by 2030, adding up to $10 trillion in economic output.

The largest areas of job creation include:

Renewable Energy (solar, wind, hydropower)

Energy Efficiency and Building Retrofits

Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems

Electric Mobility (EVs and battery systems)

Waste Management and Circular Economy industries

However, this green transition also creates a new challenge, a green skills gap. Globally, 70% of employers in renewable energy and sustainability sectors report difficulty finding skilled workers with relevant technical expertise (LinkedIn Global Green Skills Report, 2024).

For countries like Kenya, where youth unemployment remains high but the energy transition is well underway, closing this gap could directly link job creation with environmental resilience.

2. Kenya’s Leadership in Renewable Energy

A Regional Model for Clean Power

Kenya is often cited as a global model for clean energy adoption. As of 2024, over 90% of its electricity generation comes from renewable sources, primarily geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar (Ministry of Energy & Petroleum, 2024).

Flagship projects such as the Lake Turkana Wind Farm (310 MW) and Olkaria Geothermal Complex (865 MW) position Kenya as the largest producer of renewable energy in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Job Creation Potential

According to the Kenya Renewable Energy Association (KEREA, 2024), the renewable energy sector employs approximately 70,000 people, with projections to reach 200,000 by 2030 as investments in solar mini-grids, off-grid power, and green construction expand.

Key growth areas include:

Solar power installation and maintenance for homes, schools, and SMEs.

Wind energy operations and turbine maintenance in Turkana, Marsabit, and Kajiado.

Geothermal technology and plant management in Rift Valley counties.

Energy auditing and carbon accounting as companies adopt sustainability standards.

Kenya’s advantage lies in its policy stability and technical capacity, but scaling this workforce requires targeted skills programs within TVET institutions.

3. Building TVET Capacity for the Green Economy

Training for Solar, EV, and Water Management Sectors

TVET institutions are central to developing the workforce Kenya needs for the green transition. However, many programs remain focused on traditional trades, while emerging green sectors demand new competencies.

Priority training areas for green jobs include:

Solar PV Installation and Energy Storage Systems

Hands-on certification programs for technicians and engineers.

Integration of safety, maintenance, and off-grid system design.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Technology and Mobility Infrastructure

Courses in EV mechanics, battery maintenance, and charging systems.

Partnerships with private sector pioneers like Roam Electric and BasiGo Kenya to co-develop training modules.

Water and Waste Management Systems

Skills for smart irrigation, wastewater recycling, and urban drainage systems.

Alignment with the Kenya Water Institute (KEWI) and environmental engineering programs.

Competency-Based Green Skills Training

TVETA’s ongoing Competency-Based Education and Training (CBET) reforms are integrating green competencies into technical curricula. By 2025, TVETA plans to introduce green skills frameworks covering renewable energy, climate-smart agriculture, and environmental technology.

Public–Private Collaboration

Collaborations between TVET institutions and private companies are proving transformative.

Strathmore Energy Research Centre (SERC) is training solar technicians and energy auditors.

KenGen is developing geothermal training modules aligned with global standards.

GIZ’s Green TVET Program (2024) supports curriculum development and trainer capacity-building for sustainable industries.

4. Blue Economy: Unlocking Kenya’s Maritime Potential

A New Frontier for Jobs and Innovation

Stretching 600 kilometers along the Indian Ocean, Kenya’s coastline is an untapped resource for the blue economy encompassing fisheries, maritime logistics, aquaculture, marine transport, and ocean-based renewable energy.

The Kenya Blue Economy Strategy (2024–2030) projects that sustainable ocean industries could add KSh 450 billion ($3 billion) annually to the GDP by 2030 and create over 50,000 jobs in coastal counties (Kilifi, Mombasa, Lamu, and Kwale).

Emerging Opportunities

Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture

Training in fish processing, cold-chain logistics, and sustainable aquaculture management.

Leveraging partnerships with the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI).

Maritime Transport and Logistics

Expansion of Lamu Port and Mombasa Port requires logistics coordinators, ship engineers, and maritime safety professionals.

Regional integration under Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Department (BEMAD) supports workforce development in marine operations.

Marine Renewable Energy and Conservation

Emerging opportunities in offshore wind, tidal energy, and ocean conservation programs.

TVET programs in coastal regions are now aligning with these sectors.

Kenya’s blue economy not only supports job creation but also strengthens climate adaptation, food security, and biodiversity protection.

5. Financing the Green and Blue Workforce Transition

Green Financing Mechanisms

Transitioning to a sustainable economy requires significant investment in green skills development. Kenya’s government, donors, and financial institutions are developing innovative funding models:

Green Climate Fund (GCF): Supporting projects on renewable energy, climate-smart agriculture, and youth training in sustainability.

Kenya Climate Change Fund (KCCF): Financing county-level green projects, with portions allocated to training and education.

Blended Finance Models: Combining public funding, development aid, and private sector capital to fund TVET modernization and renewable energy incubation hubs.

ESG-Linked and Impact Investing

Corporate investors are aligning workforce investments with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals.

Companies like Safaricom, Equity Group Foundation, and KCB Bank are investing in youth training programs for clean energy and climate finance.

For instance, Equity Group’s Young Africa Works Program, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, has trained over 300,000 youth in green entrepreneurship and agribusiness since 2022.

The Role of Development Partners

GIZ Green TVET Africa Initiative (2024) provides funding for technical infrastructure upgrades.

World Bank’s Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project (KYEOP) includes green job apprenticeships.

UNDP Kenya Green Economy Program (2024) offers seed funding for startups promoting circular economy solutions.

Financing models that connect skills training to employment outcomes are crucial to sustain the momentum of the green transition.

6. Policy and Institutional Frameworks for a Sustainable Workforce

Kenya’s policy landscape increasingly recognizes the centrality of skills to the sustainability agenda.

Key frameworks include:

Kenya National Green Economy Strategy and Implementation Plan: Mainstreaming green skills in all economic planning.

National TVET Strategy (2023–2027): Emphasizing renewable energy, environmental technology, and smart agriculture.

Climate Change (Amendment) Act 2023: Mandating integration of green growth targets into sector policies.

These frameworks are complemented by partnerships with the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE), and Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), all emphasizing skills as the foundation for climate competitiveness.

7. Future Outlook: Kenya as a Regional Green Skills Hub

The Road to 2030

By 2030, the World Economic Forum estimates that sustainability-linked industries could make up 30% of new jobs across Africa. Kenya’s established renewable infrastructure, educated workforce, and digital ecosystem provide a head start.

To cement its leadership, Kenya should focus on three strategic priorities:

Mainstream Green Skills in All Education Levels: From secondary to higher learning, every curriculum should include climate literacy and sustainability modules.

Strengthen Public–Private Partnerships: Linking employers directly to training programs ensures relevance and employability.

Build a Regional Green Skills Hub: Through the East African Community (EAC), Kenya can lead in harmonizing standards for renewable energy, blue economy, and environmental management.

A Sustainable Workforce for a Sustainable Future

Kenya’s green and blue economies are not abstract ideas, they are real engines of growth that can redefine national prosperity.

The country’s 90% renewable energy milestone and its coastal potential position it uniquely to lead Africa’s sustainable transition.

But the real measure of success will not be in megawatts or exports; it will be in people- skilled technicians, engineers, and innovators who drive a low-carbon, inclusive economy.

By investing in green skills and blue opportunities, Kenya is not only protecting its environment but also securing its place in the global sustainable workforce.

The next decade is not just about adapting to climate change; it is about training a generation to build the future.

Dive Brief:

The PJM Interconnection needs 16 GW of energy storage by 2032, 23 GW by 2040 and 43 GW by 2045 to meet resource adequacy needs and state clean energy goals, the U.S. Energy Storage Coalition said Thursday.

The new industry association’s “Outlook for Energy Storage in PJM,” prepared by Brattle Group, said PJM needs more energy storage to address short-term resource needs amid long waits for large gas turbines and an expected 19% increase in peak load by 2030.

In an email, PJM spokesperson Dan Lockwood said his organization is committed to adding as much supply as possible in the near term, even beyond the 63 GW of projects in its queue as of June. “We need as many of those projects to come online as possible, along with much more new supply,” he said.

Dive Insight:

In modeling PJM energy storage demand out to 2045, Brattle assumed that the system operator will integrate at least 17 GW of new gas generation by 2032 and delay most planned thermal generator retirements until the mid-2030s.

It also assumed that all expected load in PJM’s Long-Term Load Forecast report will materialize. That would boost the grid’s summer peak by 16 GW in 2028 and 30 GW in 2032.

Under those assumptions, Brattle said adequate energy storage deployment could help PJM avoid up to 15 GW of load shed during extreme cold snaps and other “challenging system conditions.” Four-hour storage is the most cost-effective duration to complement PJM’s growing share of renewable generation while maintaining resource adequacy, it added, but stressed that PJM needs to add significant amounts of new gas generation and retain “conventional firm resources” other than storage into the 2040s.

If PJM adds new gas generation more slowly than expected, it will need to compensate by adding even more energy storage than projected, Brattle warned. Without adequate storage reserves, customer costs could increase 30%, due almost entirely to higher capacity prices.

Building out adequate storage to keep pace with an expected 3.5% annual increase in demand through 2032 will be challenging amid global trade uncertainty, the years-long gas turbine backlog, supply constraints for onshore wind components and PJM’s lengthy interconnection queue, Brattle said.

Though most of those factors are outside the grid operator’s control, the report warned that “interconnection queue reform is necessary … to create more opportunity for storage and other dispatchable resources to come online faster.”

PJM says it will process its remaining queue capacity in 2025 and 2026 before transitioning to the first cycle of its reformed interconnection process, which took effect in July 2023. It expects the new process will take one to two years to evaluate projects, faster than recent U.S. averages for interconnection studies.

A separate PJM process to fast-track shovel-ready dispatchable generation resources attracted nearly 12 GW earlier this year. Gas accounted for 69% of the total, with batteries and nuclear accounting for 19% and 12%, respectively.

“PJM has been clear that load growth cannot be met by the projects in the queue alone, given the speed of the forecasted demand increases,” Lockwood said.

The grid operator and its stakeholders “are exploring a number of [other] interconnection methods that could run parallel” to its new interconnection process, such as a recently-approved change that could allow energy-only resources to connect to the grid before required network upgrades are completed, he added.

Still, rapidly rising capacity prices are already pushing retail rates higher in some PJM states.

Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in September that they were prepared to leave the organization unless it gave states greater say in its governance.

v. U.S. Forest Service et al., is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.","The Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry led a coalition of Arizona business organizations in supporting the Resolution Copper project as it advances through the federal appeals process.

In an amicus curiae brief — also known as a “friend of the court” brief — filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Chamber urged the court to uphold a district court ruling that found the U.S. Forest Service complied with federal law in approving the project. Other signatories include Greater Phoenix Leadership and organizations representing skilled trade workers across Arizona.

The filing comes as the San Carlos Apache tribe and an environmentalist group appeal a trial court decision denying their request to halt the transfer of federal land to Resolution Copper under the 2014 Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act. The plaintiffs contend that the Forest Service’s environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, was inadequate.

The business and trades groups counter that the district court correctly applied the law and that recent Supreme Court guidance in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County requires judges to give “substantial deference” to agency experts on environmental reviews.

“Mining enterprises like Resolution Copper are major components of Arizona’s economy and indispensable engines of jobs, community enrichment, and tax revenues,” the amicus brief states. It argues that overly intrusive court review of agency decisions has stifled critical projects through “bureaucratic inertia and prolonged litigation.”

According to the filing, the Resolution Copper project represents an estimated $350 million in initial investment, supports hundreds of contractor and skilled-trade positions, and advances U.S. efforts to secure a domestic supply of copper — a key material for clean energy and defense technologies.

Arizona produces about 70 percent of the nation’s copper and ranks among the top three states for nonfuel mineral production. The Chamber said the outcome of the case carries broad implications for Arizona’s competitiveness and its ability to attract large-scale projects across the energy and manufacturing sectors.

In a regulatory filing on Tuesday (October 14), GM said the charges include a US$1.2 billion non-cash impairment from adjustments to EV capacity, alongside US$400 million in cash-related expenses for contract cancellations and commercial settlements tied to EV investments.

“Following recent US government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

The announcement sent GM shares down nearly 2 percent before the opening bell in New York. The stock has gained about 4.4 percent so far this year, lagging the broader S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX), which is up roughly 13 percent.

The setback comes just months after the Trump administration ended the federal EV tax credit, which was previously worth up to US$7,500 for new EVs and US$4,000 for used ones, while also weakening fuel economy and emissions standards.

The administration has also moved to block California’s planned phaseout of new gas-powered vehicle sales and freeze federal funding for EV charging infrastructure.

These reversals have lessened pressure on carmakers to move away from internal combustion engines, tilting the market once again toward gasoline vehicles that deliver higher near-term profits.

Despite current federal policies, the benefits of continuing the upward clean energy trajectory are clear

In the face of growing global climate risks, and a recession coupled with an energy affordability crisis in New Jersey, all barriers that might slow the transition to a clean energy economy must be removed.

While it is true that the transition to a clean energy economy will require more initial investment, it will reduce operating costs as compared to the current policy trajectory, according to the International Energy Agency, and will result in an affordable and fairer energy system for businesses and working families. In addition, switching to clean energy helps mitigate climate change, decrease air pollution, and improve public health. For every dollar invested, renewable energy creates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuel industry.

The good news is that we are well on our way: solar, wind, and battery storage together accounted for 93 percent of power capacity added to the US grid last year. Just before President Donald Trump’s second inauguration in January, US Department of Energy records revealed that nearly three-quarters of clean energy investments under the Inflation Reduction Act — $217 billion of clean energy investments or $1,091 per person — were slated for red states. In addition, $79 billion or $559 per person, was earmarked for blue states.

Approximately two-thirds of those investment dollars were from private companies — companies that were building new factories, investing in clean energy infrastructure, or focused on training and workforce development. In fact, Department of Energy data showed nearly 1,000 new or expanded energy manufacturing plants and 210,000 new jobs had been announced since the IRA went into effect in 2022.

The bad news is that after the inauguration, Trump swiftly signed executive orders promoting domestic fossil fuel production, rolling back regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and slowing the permitting process for clean energy projects. The president instead went all in on keeping fossil fuel plants open that are long past their prime and opened federal land up to mining. But policies such as investing $625 million to upgrade coal plants, announced at the end of September, will not reverse the economic and technical decline of the industry, which is going the way of steam in the 1840s.

The current federal government shutdown, the first in six years, has given the Department of Energy an excuse to terminate 223 clean energy projects cutting $7.56 billion that was earmarked by Congress for 16 Democratic-led states. The exact total that NJ stands to lose is still emerging. Rutgers Agrivoltaics Program — a model of dual use solar that can increase the profitability of the land and maintain its agricultural productivity while contributing to NJ’s renewable energy goals — saw its federal grant reduced by over $600,000, for example.

Growing Demand and Cheaper Costs Compel NJ to Make the Transition

The Trump administration’s efforts to stall the clean energy transition through executive orders, limit federal tax credits, and cause bottlenecks in the permitting process are short-sighted.

Not only are the public health and environmental benefits of renewables more obvious than ever before, but there is also the economic imperative.

More than 90 percent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels alternatives. At the same time, solar and wind, which have no fuel cost to generate, are now respectively 41 percent and 53 percent cheaper than fossil fuels. Improved technology has lowered the cost of solar panels 99 percent since 1980. And innovations in battery storage literally allow us to harness the sun’s power and send it to the grid as needed, bolstering the grid’s reliability, lowering spikes in power prices, and reducing costs to ratepayers.

Yet the federal government’s initiatives run counter to the administration’s own goal of “energy dominance,” and, in fact, “will make that impossible,” argues NextEra Energy Chair and CEO John Ketchum in a recent Politico article. Ketchum points out that if we do not move forward with clean energy projects, the increase in demand over the next two decades would “make the country vulnerable to energy shortages and reliability problems.”

Expanding renewable energy resources and programs for businesses and homes sets us on a path to, if not “dominance,” then energy independence. Energy independence is critical in this period of increasing international tensions. With wars brewing in every corner of the globe, the US must rely on its own resources to combat geopolitical uncertainty. And with the rapid cuts to renewable energy by the federal government, New Jersey must step up its efforts.

New Jersey’s Leadership Potential

In January, just after Trump’s inauguration, New Jersey announced a milestone in the clean energy transition: the state achieved 5 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar capacity, more than doubling its solar energy output since 2017. The Murphy Administration cheered this significant accomplishment stating that it “underscores New Jersey’s role as a national leader in climate action and clean energy innovation.”

In August, Governor Phil Murphy signed bills into law expanding both community solar and battery storage. In September, during Climate Week, the Murphy administration announced another milestone: New Jersey reached more than 250,000 electric vehicle registrations. On the heels of that announcement, the Murphy administration released a report showing that, since 2021, the state’s green workforce has increased by 12 percent, or 6,000 jobs, with over 100 new clean energy projects built. These green jobs all pay wages higher than the national average.

It is time now, before Governor Murphy leaves office in January 2026, for the State Legislature to codify Executive Order 315, which calls for 100 percent clean energy by 2035. Then the next governor should speed up the clean energy transition, addressing affordability by taking the following steps:

During the first 100 days:

Implement a Clean Energy Standard to maximize in-state job growth and create jobs in the clean-energy economy. Ensure an equitable transition to clean energy through the creation of an Office of Just Transition.

Move forward with a grid modernization plan that identifies the most beneficial and cost-effective projects to modernize NJ’s electric distribution system; speeds up resource-interconnection timelines for clean-energy electric storage systems; increases the capacity of the system to interconnect with distributed energy resources; and improves the resilience of the system against hazards associated with climate change, including extreme heat and flood risk. Require long-term transmission planning, which also protects NJ consumers and ratepayers by addressing rising costs.

During the first year:

Set standards for advanced metering infrastructure, a tool to modernize the grid by enabling electric meters to communicate wirelessly with the distribution network in real time to provide customers and utilities information on electricity usage, outages, and what parts of the grid are stressed.

Create and implement more policies that will reduce emissions through the electrification of vehicles, the improvement of building energy efficiency, and the rapid electrification of buildings.

During the first term:

Collaborate with electric utilities to design time-varying rates that incentivize customers to consume energy off-peak when the grid is less stressed. Use time-varying rates that would result in lower rates when there is less demand on the grid.

Continue to support solar generation — as informed by actual costs — and responsibly developed offshore wind — including the Wind Institute for Innovation and Training at the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Dedicate increased resources to workforce development and training.

Our next governor and our policy decision-makers must leverage free sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and storage; continue the quest to lower carbon emissions for the betterment of our health and our environment; and push the clean energy transition forward thereby securing our energy independence, creating more good-paying jobs, and making energy more affordable.

Investment in cleantech startups is tracking toward the lowest level in years. But Base Power shrugged off the market trends and just raised $1 billion to turbocharge its home battery buildout.

The colossal Series C funding round comes only six months after it raised $200 million in an April Series B. Addition led the latest round, which brought back all previous investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Valor Equity Partners. The company’s valuation now stands at $4 billion after receiving the new investment, Base Power founder and CEO Zach Dell said.

The pace and scale of those investments put the Austin, Texas–based firm in a league of its own among clean energy startups this year — beating out even the outlandish $863 million that Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised in August. Dell says his company’s traction comes down to a very clear value proposition: It’s potentially the fastest way to expand on-demand grid power at a time when everyone wants more of it.

“Right now, we’re in a capacity crunch — everyone needs capacity,” Dell said. ​“We install capacity faster and cheaper than really anyone out there.”

The U.S. is going through the fastest electricity demand growth in decades, as AI data centers proliferate, more factories open up, and customers purchase electric vehicles. Utilities have long maintained a skeptical stance toward startups’ plans to turn home energy devices into substantial forces on the grid; now, Dell said, they’re not just willing but ​“more excited than ever” to have that conversation.

The key to Base Power’s model is finding households in Texas who want cheap electricity with the benefit of backup power. The company becomes their retail power provider and installs one or two unusually large batteries on-site. Base owns the batteries, and the customers pay an installation fee starting at $695 and a small monthly rate instead of purchasing them for many thousands of dollars. Then the startup aggregates this dispersed fleet of batteries to essentially create miniature power plants it can profit from in the state’s competitive energy market.

The batteries earn money through simple arbitrage: They charge up when wind or solar production pushes prices down and then discharge when demand and prices spike. Base Power also earned certification to deliver ancillary services, which are rapid-fire adjustments to maintain grid reliability, for which batteries are uniquely suited. The company has already maxed out the 20 megawatts it can bid through the Aggregate Distributed Energy Resource pilot, a virtual-power-plant program, and is pushing for the cap to be raised, Dell said.

Base Power has begun selling its services to regulated utilities so that they can help their customers with backup power and free up more grid capacity. And Dell is scoping out other geographical markets where the rules could allow the Base Power model to grow. But for now, Texas is the ideal place to start. It not only has the competitive market run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, but it is also awash in more utility-scale solar and wind than any other state, enhancing the value of battery-based arbitrage.

When Dell spoke to Canary Media for the previous fundraise, he employed 100 people, and his in-house teams were installing 20 home battery systems per day, for a total of about 10 megawatt-hours in March. Now Base Power employs 250 people and installs double that rate. A year from now, Dell wants to install 100 megawatt-hours per month.

That’s a brash goal for a 2-year-old company. But Base Power has actually followed through on its goals, a rare distinction among buzzy cleantech startups. In April, Dell had promised 100 megawatt-hours of cumulative installations by midsummer; he hit that target and is now approaching 150 megawatt-hours.

The firm has also been planning to move from contract manufacturing for its bespoke battery enclosures to in-house manufacturing. In April, Dell said he planned to break ground on a factory near Austin by the end of the year. Now the company has leased the old Austin American-Statesman newspaper headquarters in the heart of town and has begun moving in manufacturing equipment.

“It’s a 90,000-square-foot empty warehouse that happens to be right across the street from our HQ. There’s massive amounts of benefits you get from colocating engineering and manufacturing — having the engineers be really close to the factory, being able to walk the line and make iterations in real time.”

This factory will take imported battery cells and build the modules, packs, and power electronics needed to turn them into large home-battery products. The plan is to start manufacturing in the first quarter of 2026 and ramp up to 4 gigawatt-hours per year of production capacity, Dell said. This supply chain strategy also shores up compliance with new federal rules limiting tax credits for batteries that contain too much content from China.

Base Power is already finalizing a location for a ​“much, much larger” facility outside Austin to continue growing its manufacturing capacity.

Other startups have opted for ​“capital light” strategies to get solar or batteries into the hands of customers. Base Power, in contrast, went capital-heavy, fronting the money to design, own, and install the batteries with the expectation of making future profits on their capacity. It’s too soon to know how that business bet will play out over years, but Dell indicated the early returns were attractive.

“It’s hard to raise a billion dollars without that,” he noted. ​“The math is indeed mathing.”

At the forefront of this race is Saudi Arabia, which has taken ambitious steps to establish itself as a major player in the green hydrogen market. With the announcement of a new hydrogen megaproject, the country is setting its sights on dominating the 21st-century energy landscape. This development not only underscores Saudi Arabia’s commitment to renewable energy but also highlights the strategic calculations driving its energy policies.

Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Move in the Hydrogen Race

Saudi Arabia’s NEOM project has long been heralded as a pioneering venture in the green hydrogen sector. Originally designed to have a 2.2 gigawatt electrolysis capacity, it represented a significant leap in the country’s efforts to lead the energy transition. However, the Saudi government has now decided to expand this vision even further. By nearly doubling the scale of its hydrogen production capabilities, Saudi Arabia aims to cement its status as a leading exporter of green hydrogen.

This strategic decision is driven by several factors. The first is a global ambition to be at the forefront of the clean energy revolution. As countries around the world increasingly turn to renewable energy sources, those who can supply these resources will hold significant geopolitical power. The second factor is the availability of substantial financial resources. Saudi Arabia is leveraging its oil wealth to fund these large-scale projects. Finally, fierce regional competition is pushing the country to maintain its edge. The Middle East is rapidly becoming a hub for clean energy projects, and Saudi Arabia is determined not to be left behind.

Yanbu: A Game-Changer on the Red Sea

The newly announced Yanbu project, situated on the Red Sea coast, represents a bold step forward. Developed in partnership with ACWA Power and Germany’s EnBW, it boasts an impressive 4 gigawatt electrolysis capacity. This facility is expected to generate 400,000 tons of hydrogen annually, which will be converted into green ammonia for global export. Such figures place Yanbu among the largest hydrogen projects worldwide.

What’s particularly notable about Yanbu is its strategic location and design. Positioned to dominate the Red Sea region, it is part of a vision to transform the area into a leading hydrogen hub. Industry leaders recognize its potential, with Hy24’s CEO Pierre-Etienne Franc highlighting the region’s importance for hydrogen development. The infrastructure’s scale and ambition underscore Saudi Arabia’s commitment to redefining global hydrogen production capacities.

The Global Implications of Yanbu

Yanbu’s impact extends well beyond Saudi Arabia’s borders, influencing the global dynamics of the hydrogen market. By partnering with international companies like Germany’s EnBW, Spain’s Técnicas Reunidas, and China’s Sinopec, Saudi Arabia is establishing itself as a central player in the energy transition. These collaborations bring together engineering and technical expertise necessary for such a large-scale project.

In the broader context, the Middle East and North Africa region is already responsible for 10% of global electrolysis capacity under development. Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Morocco are also investing heavily in hydrogen projects. As these nations compete for leadership in the sector, Yanbu is seen as a pivotal project that could give Saudi Arabia a definitive advantage. However, the ultimate success of these ventures depends on market conditions and the global demand for green hydrogen.

Challenges and Opportunities in the Hydrogen Market

While Saudi Arabia’s ambitions are clear, the burgeoning hydrogen market faces uncertainties. Many of these megaprojects, including Yanbu, hinge on final investment decisions. The ambition is palpable, but execution remains a critical test. Additionally, the global market must be able to absorb the vast quantities of green hydrogen that are being promised. The question is whether supply will outpace demand.

Furthermore, Saudi Arabia’s original NEOM project has faced its own challenges. Despite its promising start, it is important to monitor developments and potential setbacks. As the energy transition unfolds, stakeholders must remain vigilant and adaptable to changing circumstances. Will the world be ready to embrace green hydrogen at the scale envisioned by these projects? This question remains central to the future of the energy sector.

As Saudi Arabia pushes forward with its ambitious plans, the world watches closely. The stakes are high, and the outcomes will have far-reaching implications. The question remains: Can Saudi Arabia successfully navigate the challenges and lead the global transition to green hydrogen, or will unforeseen obstacles hinder its progress?

(AP) — Federal officials rejected a company's bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, in what would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed sale underscores a continued low appetite for coal among utilities that are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump’s attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week’s $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it's unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden's administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is starting a new program called “Accelerating Speed to Power/Winning the Artificial Intelligence Race” and has issued a Request for Information (RFI). DOE seeks public input on actions it can take to strengthen the federal government’s role in accelerating critical generation and transmission projects.

The priorities established through Accelerating Speed to Power will impact energy developers and large electricity customers. The RFI is an important opportunity for stakeholders to provide input to help frame the scope of this new DOE focus and shape the programs DOE develops. The deadline for public comments is November 21, 2025.

The “Accelerating Speed to Power” RFI

Through Accelerating Speed to Power, DOE aims to leverage several of its programs, including the Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP), the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, the DOE Loan Programs Office loans and loan guarantees, and the DOE National Laboratories’ technical assistance capabilities.

The focus of the RFI is for DOE to gather public input on leveraging its programs for Accelerating Speed to Power. The RFI emphasizes energy projects of at least 3 gigawatts in generation capacity or transmission projects with at least 500 MVA in incremental load serving capability. This can include bringing retired generation back into service or upgrading existing transmission lines.

The RFI requests public input in five specific areas:

Large-scale generation and transmission projects to enable load growth;

High-priority geographic areas for targeted DOE investment;

Best use of or opportunities for DOE funding, financing, and technical assistance;

Load growth trends; and

Grid infrastructure constraints.

Data Centers and Manufacturers

Data center developers and owners are the target audience for DOE’s RFI and are well-positioned to respond and voice their opinions. As the race to build data centers continues, these large load entities should analyze and consider commenting on:

National and local permitting and regulatory regimes to determine where significant barriers to entry exist;

Environmental considerations and clean power commitments, as well as compliance with water and air quality standards that may pose long-term operational constraints and generate friction in light of this administration’s support of traditional thermal resources;

Regional grid constraints to ensure their always-on operations have consistent, reliable power and can reduce their reliance on on-site, emergency backup generation; and

DOE’s existing financial, technical, and programmatic support, and whether any additional types of programs would be beneficial to facilitate data center development and reliable operations.

Energy Developers and Suppliers

Accelerating Speed to Power cites four executive orders (EO) supporting the initiative:

EO 14154 – Unleashing American Energy: Establishes policy to support development of firm resources and rescinds environmental policies including, electric vehicle “mandate,” clean energy, and climate goals.

EO 14179 – Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence: Establishes policy to develop AI systems “free from ideological bias,” solidifies the United States’ role as a global AI leader, and rescinds Biden administration EO 14110 – “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.”

EO 14262 – Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid: Establishes policy to strengthen the reliability and security of the grid and directs the Secretary of Energy to establish anticipated reserve margins using a methodology that accredits firm resources.

EO 14302 – Reinvigorating America’s Nuclear Industrial Base: Establishes policy to expedite and promote deployment of nuclear resources.

Although this suite of EOs generally establishes a preference for traditional generation sources, all power producers should take interest in responding to this RFI. Grid technologies and storage options are evolving rapidly in a way that substantially improves the capacity value of renewable resources like wind and solar, creating an opportunity to make the case to DOE that these resources can provide grid stability.

The RFI also presents an opportunity to influence where and how major transmission projects are sited. In addition, it is an opportunity to engage directly with the Trump administration and shape policy priorities.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15478_5804.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:04:38.960906

Shares fell less than 2 percent before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California's ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35 percent increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon-neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31 percent in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD's sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world's other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://patch.com/img/cdn20/ap/22940811/20251014/113225/styles/patch_image/public/ap25287409798899___14113036564.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 14:03:53.045148

The Washington Post on the revival of the U.S.-China trade war

The United States and China, inveterate rivals yet inextricably interlinked, are once again barreling into a trade war nobody wants. Tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, coming after a few months respite, once again threaten to damage the economies of both countries and derail global growth.

China on Thursday blindsided the White House by announcing sweeping new curbs on the export of critical raw earth minerals and magnets, needed in everything from laptops and electric vehicles to U.S. military fighter jets, submarines and missiles. Beijing added five new elements to the seven already subject to stringent export controls.

President Donald Trump responded Friday by announcing new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as new export controls on critical technology destined for China. Trump also threatened to scuttle a planned meeting later this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asian leaders meeting in South Korea. That sit-down was supposed to lay the groundwork for a full-scale summit early next year.

Both sides left time for an off-ramp. China delayed the start of its new restrictions until Dec. 1. Trump delayed the imposition of his retaliatory measures until Nov. 1. This raises the possibility that the world’s two largest economies are mainly staking out hardline negotiating positions, with threats and ultimatums, to improve their bargaining positions.

Longer term, however, the past 48 hours point toward a looming era of increasing friction as the superpowers shift from competition with occasional cooperation to clashes and outright conflict.

China controls about 70 percent of the world’s rare earth mining and 90 percent of the global processing. It was entirely foreseeable that they would use this market power as a pressure point when Trump picked a fight with Xi earlier this year.

At the same time, China has its own pain points. The United States dominates in semiconductors and chip-design software that China cannot yet manufacture domestically and needs to compete in the artificial intelligence boom. The United States also remains the world’s largest consumer market and accounts for about 15 percent of their exports.

China’s willingness to play the rare earths card has pushed the United States to look elsewhere for alternative sources, something that America should have started doing decades ago. Despite the name, rare earths are actually not all that rare, but they are currently most easily and cheaply mined in China.

The United States has vast deposits of rare earths but significantly trails China and Brazil, partly because of deindustrialization but also because mining certain materials tends to create politically untenable levels of environmental damage. As a result, Trump has been looking to strike minerals deals with countries such as Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo and possibly even Myanmar or Venezuela — all of which are embroiled in conflict but have significant assets below ground.

Even more frustrating than needing access to Chinese minerals to keep the economy going is America’s dependence on them processing and transforming its own minerals into finished products. The United States now exports 95 percent of its rare earths to China for processing because it costs so much less than doing it here. Trying to increase domestic processing capacity could take a decade or more, and permitting remains too cumbersome and slow.

Before the blowup at the end of this week, the two sides had been making conciliatory gestures on trade and seemingly trying to dial down the rhetoric ahead of the heads of state meeting. Trump nixed a $400 million lethal arms package to Taiwan, the self-governing democracy which China considers a renegade province. Trump also lifted a ban on selling AI chips to China. Beijing, in turn, toughened controls on two of the precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, one of Trump’s demands. China also gave the preliminary okay for an American consortium to take 80 percent ownership of TikTok.

The bonhomie after summer trade talks in Geneva and London belied the reality that the United States and China are locked in a herculean struggle for influence and military superiority in the Asia-Pacific region that will define the 21st century. Escalating tensions have led some to speak fancifully of decoupling or delinking of the two economies.

The hard truth is that, for the foreseeable future, the United States and China remain mutually dependent. A trade war is in neither country’s interest. Since a divorce is unrealistic, at least anytime soon, it’s better Washington and Beijing go back to talking.

The New York Times says you should blame Trump when your energy bill goes up

You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.

The Wall Street Journal on SCOTUS and racial gerrymandering

Here we go again. The Supreme Court keeps getting dragged into redistricting fights involving race, and this week the Justices will rehear a racial gerrymander challenge to Louisiana’s Congressional map. It could be a landmark that ends the cynical use of race by both major parties to advance their partisan interests.

In recent years, the Justices have considered challenges to maps in Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. They punted last term on deciding the Louisiana case (Louisiana v. Callais) that they will reconsider Wednesday. They will also take up the question of whether the intentional creation of majority-minority districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the Fifteenth Amendment’s prohibition against abridging a citizen’s right to vote based on race. The right answer is yes.

State Legislatures are caught in a legal vise. If they draw maps that consider race too little, they can be found to violate Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. If they weigh race too much, they could run afoul of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.

Liberal groups sued Louisiana after Republicans redrew the state Congressional map following the 2020 Census. The map included one majority-minority district, but the plaintiffs said Section 2 requires a second. They reasoned that because blacks make up 30% of Louisiana’s voting-age population, two of the state’s six districts should be majority black.

Section 2 bars voting practices that discriminate based on race. It also guarantees that minorities have an equal opportunity “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Congress’s aim was to prevent minorities from being disenfranchised by the likes of poll taxes.

The law’s text doesn’t mention majority-minority districts and stresses that it doesn’t establish a right to proportional representation. But the Supreme Court’s muddled Gingles precedent (1986) read into the law a requirement to draw majority-minority districts on two conditions: when minority populations are large, compact and politically cohesive, and when the majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc” to defeat a minority’s “preferred candidate.”

Courts and legislatures have struggled to divine what this means. Must a minority group’s “preferred candidate” be of the same race? How should courts determine if a minority population is “politically cohesive”? In the Louisiana case, the district court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to draw a second majority-minority district.

Republicans then drew a 250-mile majority-minority district that snakes from the state’s northwest to Baton Rouge. The district isn’t compact and is barely contiguous. Non-black voters then challenged the new map as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A lower court agreed, saying the second district violated Gingles.

In the Court’s recent Allen v. Milligan decision (2023), Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals in requiring a second majority-minority district in Alabama because the minority population was compact. The other four Justices wrote in dissent that the majority misapplied Gingles and contended that courts should “apply a race-neutral benchmark” in deciding whether maps violate Section 2.

Yet Justice Kavanaugh emphasized in a concurring opinion that “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” This echoed the Court’s SFFA v. Harvard decision striking down racial preferences in college admissions. Map-making now may be the only field in which government sorting by race remains legal.

The Court began to slide shut the door to racial gerrymandering in its landmark Shelby County (2013) decision, which struck down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 4 pre-clearance formula. The Court held that the formula was an anachronism from the Jim Crow era and didn’t account for racial progress. The same is true of the Gingles interpretation of Section 2.

As Louisiana argues, “race-based redistricting rests on an invidious stereotype: that all minorities, by virtue of their membership in their racial class, think alike and share the same interests and voting preferences.”

Justice Clarence Thomas has been making this argument for years in eloquent dissents, and he wrote last term that the Court’s “Janus-like election-law jurisprudence” has created an “intractable conflict between this Court’s interpretation” of Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause. The result is that “states do not know how to draw maps that ‘survive both constitutional and VRA review.’”

Consider Texas, which was sued by the Biden Justice Department for not drawing enough majority-minority districts. With that case pending in the courts, the Trump Justice Department threatened a legal challenge claiming several districts were “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” Texas Republicans this summer used the Trump threat as an excuse to redraw the districts to increase their partisan advantage. Now they are being sued again under Section 2.

The Justices would do the country and themselves a favor by correcting the Gingles error and declaring that the Constitution forbids race-based map-making. As the Chief wrote in a 2006 redistricting opinion, “it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.”

The Guardian says the relief is real, but will Palestinian suffering end?

The reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, the release of the living hostages has led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due to uncertainty about who is being freed and where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return to dig through rubble for the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.

As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefire appeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined a high-powered peace summit of more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination in Mr Trump’s plan gives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.

The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidents Obama and Biden. This despite the Biden administration a year ago having attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.

A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.

Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid – and food and medicines must be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, with Sir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.

Strong international support for the Palestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump's crackdowns on student visas

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

So declared Donald Trump in 2015, kicking off a presidential campaign rooted in hatred, fear and xenophobic myth — though at least tempered by the “good people” afterthought.

But 10 years later, it turns out “good people” from around the world aren’t welcomed in Trump’s America, either. Even foreign college students here legally and on their own dime to study in America’s great universities — the very definition of the “best of the best” — are getting the signal loud and clear that this president doesn’t want them here.

In St. Louis, as around the nation, colleges and universities have seen their enrollment of foreign students here on student visas plummet this year. Some of it’s due to stricter student visa requirements the administration is imposing for no good reason. Others are choosing not to come here out of concern about whether they will be allowed to stay and work after graduation — a concern exacerbated by the administration’s new $100,000 H-1B work visa fee on American employers who want to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.

Still others, presumably, are repelled by the toxic and increasingly brazen anti-immigrant rhetoric from the MAGA movement and its expanding campaign to rid America of anyone not born here.

That campaign is especially self-destructive when it comes to supporting American higher education. Unlike most American-born college students, foreign students who study here generally are paying top tuition rates, a financial lifeline for institutions that have struggled with diminishing public funding and declining enrollment by American-born students.

As the Post-Dispatch’s Monica Obradovic reports, a survey of four St. Louis-area universities found a drop in international enrollment of more than 2,700 students this year compared to last. St. Louis University alone has dropped by more than 1,500 international students. Washington University in St. Louis is down almost 1,000 foreign students. Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville is down 15%.

It’s part of a national trend that has dire implications for America’s economy. The NAFSA Association of International Educators estimates that foreign students contribute close to $44 billion to the economy annually, including supporting more than 378,000 jobs here. The New York Times reported this month that nearly 20% fewer international students arrived in the U.S. for the start of the current school year in August compared to last year. That’s the largest one-year drop on record except for the 2020 pandemic year.

Some of the administration’s student visa revocations have been in response to foreign students engaging in peaceful protest against U.S. policy regarding Gaza and other controversies. That’s a shameful statement to the world about how little our current president values our own First Amendment.

But most of the decline in international students is due to stricter student visa restrictions, travel bans from specific countries — and students simply (and understandably) declining to come here because of the current xenophobic political climate fueled by this administration. A spokesperson for Webster University in St. Louis County, for example, told the Post-Dispatch’s Obradovic that the private school has seen international enrollment fall at its three domestic campuses in favor of its seven foreign campuses.

The issue is bigger than money. International students tend to be the best and the brightest from their countries. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that fully one in four billion-dollar American startups have founders or co-founders who initially came here as international students. George Mason University reported in 2024 that almost one-third of Nobel laureates affiliated with American academic institutions were born somewhere else.

In terms of both economic and intellectual benefit to the U.S., these are exactly the “good people” Trump alluded to a decade ago. Yet under his current regime, they’re being expelled, barred or just convinced to stay away in record numbers. We’re all the poorer for it.

For thousands of years, Indigenous people stewarded their forests with fire. This cultural burning is part traditional food and craft production, part environmental protection and part ceremony with the land. Western settlement transformed the region with mining and logging, uprooting Native peoples and putting out cultural fire practices.

In the 19th century, California lawmakers suppressed the burns. An 1850 law made it legal to fine or punish anyone burning land. The 1911 Weeks Act instituted a policy of total fire suppression, dictating that state and federal agencies should control wildland fires to prevent their spread. This made cultural fire illegal at a federal level. Native people were shot and imprisoned for starting fires.

A tree ring chronology of the forest burn scars from 1600s to 2015. The text points out where in 1850, California banned cultural fire. Again in 1911, as part of the Weeks Act, the U.S. passed measures to suppress fires nationwide.

Now, after a new generation of tribal and community members organizing, educating and lobbying about the benefits of bringing fire back to the land, this time-honored practice is returning. Last fall, California enacted legislation allowing federally recognized Native American tribes to conduct cultural burning, acknowledging their sovereignty and history with the land.

The legislative victory allows tribes to set fires with less federal oversight and recognizes cultural burning as a way to make the state resilient to wildfires. Two Washington Post reporters traveled to Northern California to witness the practices firsthand.

Living with fire

I .

We watched them paint with fire. Water hoses in hand, two men corralled a three-foot-high fire as it moved through an open field, hosing down grass to keep the flames under control. It’s a scene that normally spells wildfire disaster. And yet the fire moved alongside the group.

They’re cultural fire practitioners: trained and recognized by tribes to guide and manage blazes. This particular group was led by Bill Tripp, the director of natural resources and environmental policy for the Karuk Tribe. It was the end of June when we caught up with them as they burned farmland in Orleans, California, about 50 miles south of the Oregon border.

Like most burns for tribes native to this stretch of the Klamath River, their activity encourages native species growth, reduces wildfire risk and protects raw materials for craft. They conducted it on the Karuk-owned Tishaniik Farm, an agriculture project that started during the pandemic to provide food for the community.

As they moved along the field ,

so went

the fire.

In its burned path

the “black line” appeared.

There’s clear skill in reading a fire: when to stop it, how to use the terrain to their advantage, when to let it go. The crew has now erected a perimeter around the field working counterclockwise. They stopped when the black line reached the top of a hill, extinguished the flames, doubled back from where they were to start new fires and then let the prevailing wind and slope work with the fresh fires.

From the back of the truck, two men hosed down either side of the fire. They guided the flames to move along and cut perimeter around the field. By encircling the grasses, they can contain the blazes.

They’re using the terrain, Tripp pointed out, so the fire will burn up toward the other end of the black line without getting out of control.

A burn is different from a prescribed fire, which the U.S. Forest Service uses to protect against major wildfires. While the agency works to reduce fodder for a possible blaze, Indigenous-led fires aim to protect their way of life.

Both can produce harmful smoke, detractors of the practices point out. Research shows prescribed fires produce around 17 percent of the fine particle pollution of a comparable wildfire, and make uncontrolled blazes less likely in the future.

While the acreage involved in burns can be much smaller, it can benefit the landscape in the same ways as a prescribed fire. Some researchers emphasize centering traditional knowledge in managing fire-prone forests and vegetation since these communities often take steps to avoid having blazes run out of control. New Mexico’s worst-ever recorded fire, the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon fire in 2022, took place when the Forest Service’s prescribed burns spread during windy conditions.

Such incidents are rare, however. Fire practitioners pay attention to local conditions to determine when and for how long to burn. Tripp started the burns late in the afternoon, aiming to slow the fires with the rising humidity.

By 6 p.m., the truck returned roadside along the river with a fresh tank of water. They moved the fire downhill toward the road, completing the perimeter. The seven-foot-wide burned path is meant to keep the fire from spreading, and the nearby gravel road will not burn. Earlier Bill pointed out a patch of yellow grass running through the black line. Easy to miss, but he said they would wet it down so the fire wouldn’t escape and burn a nearby field.

Once the outer edges of the area were completed, everyone began lighting around the field from the outside in. Aaron Pole, a Hoopa tribe member and natural resource technician, passed by us just shy of a jog to pull the truck out and said: “Now the hard work’s done and you let the fire do its thing.”

The flames changed in velocity and size within 10 minutes, stretching up as high as a house. One could feel their heart pulsing under their skin. Seeing the billowing fires confuses the brain on whether one should panic or not. A rush of air picked up as the fires consumed the oxygen from inside the field. Everything sped up while little vortexes of grass and flame would spin up and peter out. Excited whoops went out from around the site.

And just like that ,

by 8:30 p.m. ,

the fires were gone.

Bringing fire back to the land

II .

The Cultural Fire Management Council (CFMC), which practices on the neighboring Yurok Reservation and its ancestral lands, postponed its burns that week after spotting quail eggs in a nest. The organization has been training the next generation of community members leading burns for over a decade. Margo Robbins, the council’s co-founder and executive director, said that the fires would wait until fledglings can make their way to safety.

A 2024 paper on cultural burning estimates that before Western colonization, the Karuk Aboriginal territory along the Klamath River had nearly 7,000 ignitions a year. That’s an average of 19 ignitions a day over an area 3½ times the size of New York City. Researchers estimate that at the time, every Indigenous person ignited two to a dozen fires a year.

Robbins came to cultural burning through weaving baskets, for which Yurok tribes are renowned. These technological marvels can be watertight and can be used for cooking, for carrying infants and toddlers, and in ceremonial rituals. The weaving material, though, needs fire to exist.

The California Hazelnut, a squat underbrush shrub, grows its shoots straight when burned. When Robbins started, the raw materials were hard to come by.

The CFMC launched its burns in 2012, working with their community group, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Yurok Tribal Council, burning seven acres. The next year, they burned 67 acres. Working with the Nature Conservancy, four local tribes, and state and local parks, the council now has 23 employees.

At her home, she showed us piles of hazelnut branches in her craft room lying in wait to be split and bound. Along her shelves are beaded necklaces, some for the flower dance ceremony, and smaller baskets she’s made. Robbins held up an incomplete one — a tight matrix of bright blond and dark material — that her late grandmother started but never completed. Maybe she’ll finish it one day, she said with a smile, placing it back.

Frank Lake, a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service and co-author of the 2024 study simulating precolonial burn rates, says it’s clear tribes native to this region intentionally modified the landscape. Lake, who has Karuk ancestry with Yurok family members, centers much of his scientific work on tribal knowledge, bearing out what is known through recorded history, oral history and available data.

Lake pointed to the impacts of excluding fire in the region, including overgrowth of trees in the Klamath Mountains, loss of biodiversity and denser tree crowns ripe for severe wildfires.

“The landscape is sick,” said Lake, a tribal resident and liaison.

Using the Karuk word “pikyav,” meaning “to fix,” he called the recent adoption of fire practice a powerful moment where national interests can be met when tribal leadership is empowered. As Lake’s grandfather put it, “fire is medicine.”

Since colonization, forests and vegetation have shifted from their historic roots. Invasive plant growth can make wildfires more severe, a risk that researchers say is compounded by drought and hotter temperatures.

This map shows vegetation departure from pre-colonization overlaid on wildfire risk as a measure of how non-native forests and vegetation might contribute to fire risk.

Lake challenged assumptions about what’s “natural” with his understanding of the landscape. If fires tended the hillside by protecting acorn-bearing tan oak trees, is that a forest, or is that an orchard? His research shows tribes have shaped crops with fire for centuries. Now living in a time where burns are legal again, he spoke about how he feels privileged to raise his son in this moment. But the Trump administration, which has pushed for the “immediate suppressing of fires,” could reverse some of the new policies aimed at reintroducing fires to the landscape.

“We hustle because we know time is limited,” Lake said.

Fire ecology

III .

“The more you work in the West, the more you work with fire.” That was Gavin Jones’s experience when his study on spotted owl habitats pivoted after the birds’ roosts went to ash.

Jones is a research ecologist with the Rocky Mountain Research Station. Studying the threatened species, he found that wildfires play a role in where the birds choose to live. The owls prefer a Goldilocks-home: not pristine, not too fire scarred, something burned just so.

Historically, Jones said, fire was an enormous part of the landscape in much of the western United States. But fire suppression policies led to dramatic changes by the late 1800s. In colder and wetter forests like those in the Pacific Northwest, a fire’s ability to spread is now dictated by warmer temperatures, while blazes in forests like those along the Sierra Nevada range became fuel-limited, meaning they depend on available fuel sources like dry grasses, combustibles or water-stressed trees.

Centuries of excluding fire from these forests meant higher tree density and less biodiversity. Jones says that on the evolutionary scale, fire adaptation can happen pretty rapidly, especially after a sudden shift. “It is a strong selection force.”

Burns encourage more variation in the forest landscape, which leads to greater biodiversity — but there are hard limits. Even in species like the black-backed woodpecker, which needs a burned area for its habitat, few were found after the 2013 Rim and 2014 King wildfires.

Researchers like Tom Swetnam, a professor emeritus of dendrochronology and fire history at the University of Arizona, warn that cultural fire can’t be applied to all forests, since in some places this traditional knowledge has been lost.

“It’s not an obvious solution for everywhere,” Swetnam said.

Robbins with the CFMC took us to the Weitchpec transfer station, a 20-minute drive from the Tishaniik Farm, where some of the oldest continually treated forest projects are. We saw how different the understory could feel. Sunlight blankets what is otherwise a claustrophobic and shady part of the woods.

Robert McConnell — the council’s burn boss, or fire manager — reached out to grab a hazelnut branch basking in the sun as he told us about the group’s first burn here in 2012. As he petted the low brush with care, I noticed the stark contrast with a darker patch of forest over his shoulders: That land is off limits to burning. Dense with fir trees, you could scarcely see through it, while we stood in an open area marked by thickets of low grasses, shrubs and oak trees.

Robert peered into the hollow burn scar in a conifer, its dark corners now an animal’s storehouse for hazelnuts. Nearby, native potatoes and berries grew unabated. McConnell examined where someone had been harvesting branches for basket materials, concluding that it must have been recent. These resources are all made possible from burning here, he said, pausing to listen for the call of a variegated woodpecker.

A recent study by Gavin Jones found that continuing under the status quo of fire exclusion in the Sierra Nevada range would mean a 64 percent chance of complete forest loss in the next 50 years. That risk increased to a near total loss by the end of the century. Forest restoration through mechanical thinning and beneficial fire, like cultural burns, reduce these chances to single digits.

When massive fires break out, both prescribed and managed burned forests do better. A study by Jones and others from earlier this year found that treated areas in southwestern New Mexico burned less severely by 21 to 55 percent. Good fire-centered forest management is filtering into how the country reduces wildfire risk.

All Hands All Lands, a cooperation of tribal and civic organizations leading burns in the region, cleared out brush and set fires along the sloping hillside by the Klamath River. Staring at the blazes along Sandy Bar Ranch, her home and business, Blythe Reis said she feels protected when the temperature reaches 100 degrees and when lightning strikes come. “We’ve been doing controlled burns on our property for eight to 10 years now. It just makes you feel safer.”

On our last day with Tripp, he took us through back roads to a site where they first started prescribed burns. Along the way we stopped for a sip of fresh spring water flowing from a rocky hillside, noting that burns improve the health of nearby springs.

Tripp started burning at the age of four, after his grandmother caught him making fires and told him that he might as well be useful. He figured out how to move the fire, contain it, and kindle new areas in his backyard. For the next few years his grandmother would tell him stories of cultural fire every night, and one night when he was eight, she asked him, “Now that you have this knowledge, what are you going to do with it?

The next day, a few miles from the Oregon border, I found myself talking with a postal worker in the town of Happy Camp who suggested I drive some 40 minutes up the road to see the burn scar. Though it has been five years since the devastating Slater fire, the landscape feels as though fires tore through recently. There’s barely a sound, and wind sweeps freely through the matchstick remains of conifers.

The Advisory Board meeting was held from September 23 – 25.

EPA had announced the e-Manifest Advisory Board meeting and also included in the Federal Register notice:

Charge Questions posed to the e-Manifest Advisory Board.

Background White Paper providing information on the issues to be discussed by the Board.

ASTSWMO describes itself as an organization representing the 50 States, 5 Territories and the District of Columbia whose mission is to enhance and promote effective State and Territorial programs and to affect relevant national policies for waste and materials management, environmentally sustainable practices, and environmental restoration.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) cradle-to-grave Hazardous Waste Tracking System attempts to ensure that hazardous waste is properly generated, transported, and treated or disposed. The cradle-to-grave system has always been a key component of RCRA.

Federal legislation enacted in 2012 tasked EPA with the development of a national electronic manifest system. Further, it authorized the federal agency to assess the cost of developing and operating an e-Manifest system from user fees. Such fees would be charged to those who use the hazardous waste manifest to track off-shipments of their waste.

The e-Manifest system is a national database that similarly tracks hazardous waste shipments. It was launched by EPA in 2009. The goal of the e-Manifest system is to improve access to higher quality and timely data while also saving time and resources for industry, state, and territorial programs.

ASTSWMO notes in its September 16th comments that the theme of the Advisory Board meeting is referenced as:

Accelerating the Future: Phasing out Paper Manifests to Unlock the Full Potential of e-Manifest.

ASTSWMO states that it has reversed its position regarding retention of use of paper manifests. It states that the organization:

…now supports the use of fully electronic manifests.

One stated reason for this position is the concern that because data quality issues persist, it believes that maintaining two separate systems is contributing is contributing to such problems and that a transition to fully electronic manifesting, with all entities providing an electronic signature is preferrable.

Additional points raised in the ASTSWMO comments include:

Coordinating with the U.S. Department of Transportation is necessary, as it appears to be one of the most significant impediments to achieving a fully electronic e-Manifest system (noting DOT requires a physical paper copy of the manifest to be in the transport vehicle).

If EPA chooses to sunset paper manifests and transition to a fully electronic system:

Facilities that are normally very small quantity generators but have an episodic event should be required to register with the e-Manifest system in order to retain records.

EPA should consider the impact of the paper sunset requirement on the use of voluntary manifests as contemplated in the e-Manifest Frequently Asked Questions.

Supports EPA requiring e-Manifest registration for all entities involved in the waste handling process, including the generator, transporter, and the designated facility.

Supports removing the existing paper-based manifest record-retention requirements (entities currently required to maintain a paper manifest should be obligated to establish and maintain electronic access to their manifest via the e-Manifest system).

Supports a delayed enforcement and compliance approach to sunset paper manifests.

Appreciates EPA’s acknowledgement of state regulators and providing user support and management of the user registration process.

Supports EPA hosting an e-Manifest User Conference as outlined in the Background White Paper.

Added work on e-Manifest information has stretched limited state program resources and may not be sustainable without revisiting funding levels or expectations of workload.

agrees with EPA’s proposal related to the replacement manifest as outlined in the Background White Paper in the event that the e-Manifest system becomes temporarily unavailable for electronic manifest tracking.

Leading professors and practitioners choose the top articles each year through a competitive peer review process of hundreds of articles. The final honorees represent “the most insightful thinking” on a wide range of current and emerging legal issues in the field, according to the company’s website.

“I am extremely proud of this paper, and it means the world to me to have it recognized by fellow scholars and practitioners of environmental law,” Rothschild said. “The project allowed me to combine my legal expertise with my training in the history of science, and I hope it will prove valuable to both scholars and judges grappling with recent developments in environmental and administrative law doctrine.”

First published in the Indiana Law Journal, Rothschild’s article takes a deep dive into the roots of the US Supreme Court’s “major questions doctrine,” with the aim of understanding this history’s implications for current litigation over environmental and public health regulations. The major questions doctrine maintains that federal agencies must have explicit authority from Congress to enact regulations with significant economic or political impact.

Rothschild’s article shows that the roots of the doctrine go back to the Supreme Court’s 1980 decision in Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, commonly known as the “benzene case.” In that decision, the court invalidated new restrictions on workplace exposure to benzene, a toxic chemical that can cause leukemia.

The article employs hundreds of archival documents and a dozen oral histories to understand the underlying science behind the benzene regulation and why the justices ruled as they did. As Rothschild demonstrates, unsubstantiated fears that regulation of carcinogens would cripple US industry and doubts about the adequacy of scientific research regarding benzene’s harms led the court to strike down the exposure limits.

The paper then details problematic parallels between the benzene case and other “major questions” decisions, notably exaggerated economic effects, disregard for statutory constraints on agency discretion, and deference to unqualified scientific experts. Rothschild argues that the benzene case’s history and legacy should thus “caution us from continuing down a path that devalues expertise and the role of the democratically elected branches in protecting the public.”

However, one major barrier to widespread adoption remains. While some people have the freedom, space and financial ability to install a charging station at their home, many do not. Additionally, the lack of publicly available charging stations hinders the convenience of driving an EV long distances.

In cities, where most people live in apartment buildings and space is scarce, owning an EV is nearly impossible due to the lack of charging options. Researchers at Penn State set out to solve this problem by integrating EV chargers into existing streetlights. They published their findings in the Journal of Urban Planning and Development.

Test subject: Kansas City

The research team created a scalable framework to develop and analyze the possibility of using streetlights as EV chargers. They installed 23 streetlight charging units in Kansas City, Missouri, and collected data over one year.

The researchers found that their charging stations were more cost- and time-efficient, had less environmental impact and were more convenient and accessible than traditional EV chargers.

“Streetlight poles are already powered and typically owned by municipalities, making them relatively easy to work with. Their placement – often near on-street parking and in high-traffic areas – makes them well positioned to serve both local residents and visitors,” said Xianbiao Hu, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State.

The project was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and conducted in partnership with the non-profit organization Metro Energy Center, local utilities companies and the National Renewable Energy Lab.

Scaling up

The team created a three-pronged approach for other communities to use to install and use their own streetlight charging stations. The plan is focused on demand, feasibility and benefits. Researchers determined demand by evaluating land use, station density, nearby points of interest and traffic volume. They used this data to train AI models to make demand predictions.

“The scalability was a huge part of what makes this framework important,” said corresponding author Yang Song, a doctoral student at Penn State at the time of the research, “Creating something that works not just in one specific city but that can be adopted by many communities easily is critical for increasing EV use across the country.”

The model helped the researchers choose the 23 streetlights that became charging stations in Kansas City. The streetlight chargers had significantly shorter charging times, likely because they drew power from the dedicated municipal electrical lines and had less competition from charging multiple vehicles simultaneously.

The streetlight chargers were also less expensive to install since the infrastructure was already in place. The researchers found that the chargers contributed to a 11.94% greater avoided gasoline consumption and 11.24% higher GHG reductions compared to traditional EV charging stations.

The team is working on refining their predictive models to incorporate socio-economic data and weather information.

A slowing US market

Bloomberg reports that global sales of EVs continue to rise and are estimated to represent one in four cars sold in 2025. Electrification is also rising in buses and two- and three-wheelers. Almost half of bus and two- and three-wheeler sales were from electric vehicles.

Globally, China dominates the EV market. Over half of the vehicles sold in China are electric. Battery manufacturing is also heavily concentrated in China.

Meanwhile, sales in the U.S. are slowing, possibly due to policy changes and uncertainty. Bloomberg lowered their prediction for the number of EVs in 2030 from over 35 million to under 25 million.

Adoption of plans for more chargers, like the Penn State project, could help support lowering sales in the U.S. by making EV ownership more convenient and cheaper than traditional vehicles.",https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ev-charger-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:02:27.189293

Dive Brief:

Harris County, Texas, sued the Environmental Protection Agency Monday for canceling its Solar For All grant funding. Harris County received one of the largest Solar for All Awards in 2024.

The EPA eliminated the program in August, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but the lawsuit states “the OBBBA provides no authority for EPA’s Elimination Decision.”

“The Trump administration is breaking the law to score political points, and Harris County residents shouldn’t have to pay that price,” Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement posted on social media. “Congress appropriated this funding, EPA awarded it to Harris County after a rigorous competitive process.”

Dive Insight:

Monday’s lawsuit follows a similar, separate complaint filed last week by a coalition of community and labor groups. That suit says the EPA’s termination of Solar For All was unconstitutional and caused them harm.

The Texas Solar for All Coalition was awarded nearly $250 million in 2024 to expand solar access across the state as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Harris County — the state’s largest county and home to Houston — led the coalition and secured more than $54 million.

On August 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency would no longer implement the $7 billion Solar for All program, saying the OBBBA “repealed EPA’s authority to administer the program and rescinded all remaining funds.”

Zeldin said very little of the money had been spent and recipients were “still very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process.”

On Sept. 2, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit supported the EPA’s termination of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants, stating the Biden administration modified the grant agreements “to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.”

Harris County’s lawsuit asserts the OBBBA rescinds only $19 million in unobligated administrative costs, not the grant funds that were obligated by the IRA’s Sept. 30, 2024, deadline.

Rescinding the funding causes “irreparable harm to Harris County and its constituents,” the lawsuit states. “Harris County personnel and Texas Coalition staff have dedicated countless hours to setting up operations for Solar for All and working to deliver the program’s benefits to their constituents,” the plaintiffs state.

Reshoring capacitor film manufacturing alone can reclaim $200 billion annually while securing today’s grid and tomorrow’s fusion revolution.
If we continue outsourcing energy supply chains, we risk national security and forfeit the economic benefits of our energy transition.","Jim Welsh is CEO of Peak Nano.

National security requires self-reliance and independence. Today, America’s energy infrastructure and supply chain face a critical test of both.

Electrification, AI, data centers and extreme weather are driving unprecedented demand for energy and grid reliability. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest Grid Reliability Report makes one thing clear: the time for “business-as-usual” is over. The U.S. can’t keep up, let alone grow, on old infrastructure. We need a radical shift to expand, modernize and intelligently manage the grid.

Success depends on bold investments in digital technologies, enhanced equipment and advanced grid management. Together, these will enable real-time monitoring, rapid integration of renewables and far less energy lost in transmission, which today can range from 8-12% of power generation. That’s how America will meet surging demand and protect its global leadership in the AI era.

The U.S. has an Achilles’ heel: critical materials. At the heart of grid reliability are magnets, rare-earth minerals and dielectric film. These materials are often overlooked but are vital for our power infrastructure, grid reliability and every part of our energy security. Dielectric films, for example, are used in capacitors that condition power, convert AC/DC power, keep power flowing steadily and even help manage spikes in demand to keep the grid stable and secure.

The problem? The U.S. has outsourced our ability to replace failing transformers, capacitors and other critical grid components. Capacitor film — a highly engineered, ultra-thin plastic that enables power stability and distribution for our grid — is almost entirely made overseas, and 75% is made in China, which dominates the global supply.

Every year, we spend nearly $200 billion overseas for this film and other critical materials. Historically, we’ve migrated our capacity to manufacture it overseas. No American manufacturer even builds the equipment to make dielectric films.

This isn’t just an economic drain that creates risk for the U.S. It’s a huge strategic liability threatening our national security and stifling innovation at the moment our nation needs it most to drive AI and defense. To close this gap and lead the new energy era, we must reshore manufacturing and upgrade the supply chain for these core materials.

As DOE Secretary Chris Wright stated, “If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.”

The hidden costs of offshoring

Between subsidies and coordinated industrial strategy, China dominates clean energy supply chains. Its factories are running far beyond demand, creating an overcapacity that keeps prices low and puts Western manufacturers on the back foot.

Our reliance on foreign supply chains to uphold our energy infrastructure leaves us dangerously exposed. Our capacitor film supply could be cut off at any moment. The consequences would be immediate and severe, triggering blackouts, crippling industries and derailing America’s position in the global energy race.

Even with more limited supply disruptions, utilities could face delays, spikes in cost and worse — compromised reliability during peak events like heat domes, extreme weather and surging data center loads.

The case for reshoring

Building secure domestic supply chains for grid materials like capacitor film will fuel U.S. economic growth and technological leadership, supporting the creation of a high-skilled workforce and robust manufacturing capacity here at home. Grid-enhancing technologies also foster trust in our energy infrastructure and provide long-term cost stability for ratepayers.

We’re talking about a global film capacitor market that stood at $4.1 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $10.3 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 31.5%, according to Grandview Research. Beyond this market, reshoring is our path to claim billions (even trillions) in nuclear and commercial fusion, with film technology that can support high-temperature operations.

The companies and countries that control critical grid materials will set the pace for the next energy revolution.

Read More in Regulation & Policy

Recent federal action — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has changed the playing field for power strategy with its focus on expanding U.S. manufacturing, 24/7 power generation resources and U.S. sources of critical materials. However, this alone is not enough to close the gap with countries that have benefited from decades of government subsides and investment. The new Energy Dominance Financing authority, which provides loans for grid enhancement, is capped at just $1 billion, a limit other global suppliers do not have. It would cost over $25 billion just to build out the required capacitor film lines, as an example. This does not include transformers, switches, power plants, grid towers and other required equipment.

A new model for innovation

Utilities, industries and the DOE will play an integral leadership role in reshoring America’s grid. No single sector can do this alone, and forward-thinking utilities are already breaking the mold. Dominion Energy is investing in fusion, Tennessee Valley Authority and Type One Energy have partnered to develop a commercial fusion power plant, Georgia Power has added two units to the Vogtle nuclear plant and Meta is partnering with Constellation Energy to drive more energy production through nuclear power.

Instead of waiting for vendors to pitch generic solutions, these utilities are openly sharing their challenges, publishing their R&D roadmaps, and hosting innovation summits for startups and established firms to propose targeted, high-impact solutions. This lowers barriers for new entrants and aligns grid technology innovation with actual utility needs.

The message to American innovators is clear: expand domestic production, prove your worth, and utilities will test, deploy and scale your technologies.

Read More in Regulation & Policy

We need more partnerships like these: targeted, transparent and focused on results. Government, industry and utilities should align around shared R&D priorities and rapid deployment, advancing focused policies and incentives. We must level the playing field for American innovators, expand our production capacity, and launch national upskilling initiatives to train the next generation of materials scientists and engineers.

What’s at stake: the US economy and security

Advanced energy materials should be treated as a central pillar in America’s economy and national security, on par with semiconductors and rare earths. Reshoring capacitor film manufacturing alone can reclaim $200 billion annually while securing today’s grid and tomorrow’s fusion revolution.

If we continue outsourcing energy supply chains, we risk national security and forfeit the economic benefits of our energy transition. America will be left scrambling for scraps while our competitors dictate the terms.

It’s not too late. By rebuilding our own foundation now, we can transform vulnerability into strength and make the U.S. the architect of the next energy era.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/oWcymlewXofqOmHjVYk3R1PlcNYDCwDyWVQ4D0Y0F2M/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTY5NDQ4NzE4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-14 12:14:19.036115

The Washington Post on the revival of the U.S.-China trade war

The United States and China, inveterate rivals yet inextricably interlinked, are once again barreling into a trade war nobody wants. Tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, coming after a few months respite, once again threaten to damage the economies of both countries and derail global growth.

China on Thursday blindsided the White House by announcing sweeping new curbs on the export of critical raw earth minerals and magnets, needed in everything from laptops and electric vehicles to U.S. military fighter jets, submarines and missiles. Beijing added five new elements to the seven already subject to stringent export controls.

President Donald Trump responded Friday by announcing new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as new export controls on critical technology destined for China. Trump also threatened to scuttle a planned meeting later this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asian leaders meeting in South Korea. That sit-down was supposed to lay the groundwork for a full-scale summit early next year.

Both sides left time for an off-ramp. China delayed the start of its new restrictions until Dec. 1. Trump delayed the imposition of his retaliatory measures until Nov. 1. This raises the possibility that the world’s two largest economies are mainly staking out hardline negotiating positions, with threats and ultimatums, to improve their bargaining positions.

Longer term, however, the past 48 hours point toward a looming era of increasing friction as the superpowers shift from competition with occasional cooperation to clashes and outright conflict.

China controls about 70 percent of the world’s rare earth mining and 90 percent of the global processing. It was entirely foreseeable that they would use this market power as a pressure point when Trump picked a fight with Xi earlier this year.

At the same time, China has its own pain points. The United States dominates in semiconductors and chip-design software that China cannot yet manufacture domestically and needs to compete in the artificial intelligence boom. The United States also remains the world’s largest consumer market and accounts for about 15 percent of their exports.

China’s willingness to play the rare earths card has pushed the United States to look elsewhere for alternative sources, something that America should have started doing decades ago. Despite the name, rare earths are actually not all that rare, but they are currently most easily and cheaply mined in China.

The United States has vast deposits of rare earths but significantly trails China and Brazil, partly because of deindustrialization but also because mining certain materials tends to create politically untenable levels of environmental damage. As a result, Trump has been looking to strike minerals deals with countries such as Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo and possibly even Myanmar or Venezuela — all of which are embroiled in conflict but have significant assets below ground.

Even more frustrating than needing access to Chinese minerals to keep the economy going is America’s dependence on them processing and transforming its own minerals into finished products. The United States now exports 95 percent of its rare earths to China for processing because it costs so much less than doing it here. Trying to increase domestic processing capacity could take a decade or more, and permitting remains too cumbersome and slow.

Before the blowup at the end of this week, the two sides had been making conciliatory gestures on trade and seemingly trying to dial down the rhetoric ahead of the heads of state meeting. Trump nixed a $400 million lethal arms package to Taiwan, the self-governing democracy which China considers a renegade province. Trump also lifted a ban on selling AI chips to China. Beijing, in turn, toughened controls on two of the precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, one of Trump’s demands. China also gave the preliminary okay for an American consortium to take 80 percent ownership of TikTok.

The bonhomie after summer trade talks in Geneva and London belied the reality that the United States and China are locked in a herculean struggle for influence and military superiority in the Asia-Pacific region that will define the 21st century. Escalating tensions have led some to speak fancifully of decoupling or delinking of the two economies.

The hard truth is that, for the foreseeable future, the United States and China remain mutually dependent. A trade war is in neither country’s interest. Since a divorce is unrealistic, at least anytime soon, it’s better Washington and Beijing go back to talking.

The New York Times says you should blame Trump when your energy bill goes up

You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.

The Wall Street Journal on SCOTUS and racial gerrymandering

Here we go again. The Supreme Court keeps getting dragged into redistricting fights involving race, and this week the Justices will rehear a racial gerrymander challenge to Louisiana’s Congressional map. It could be a landmark that ends the cynical use of race by both major parties to advance their partisan interests.

In recent years, the Justices have considered challenges to maps in Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. They punted last term on deciding the Louisiana case (Louisiana v. Callais) that they will reconsider Wednesday. They will also take up the question of whether the intentional creation of majority-minority districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the Fifteenth Amendment’s prohibition against abridging a citizen’s right to vote based on race. The right answer is yes.

State Legislatures are caught in a legal vise. If they draw maps that consider race too little, they can be found to violate Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. If they weigh race too much, they could run afoul of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.

Liberal groups sued Louisiana after Republicans redrew the state Congressional map following the 2020 Census. The map included one majority-minority district, but the plaintiffs said Section 2 requires a second. They reasoned that because blacks make up 30% of Louisiana’s voting-age population, two of the state’s six districts should be majority black.

Section 2 bars voting practices that discriminate based on race. It also guarantees that minorities have an equal opportunity “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Congress’s aim was to prevent minorities from being disenfranchised by the likes of poll taxes.

The law’s text doesn’t mention majority-minority districts and stresses that it doesn’t establish a right to proportional representation. But the Supreme Court’s muddled Gingles precedent (1986) read into the law a requirement to draw majority-minority districts on two conditions: when minority populations are large, compact and politically cohesive, and when the majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc” to defeat a minority’s “preferred candidate.”

Courts and legislatures have struggled to divine what this means. Must a minority group’s “preferred candidate” be of the same race? How should courts determine if a minority population is “politically cohesive”? In the Louisiana case, the district court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to draw a second majority-minority district.

Republicans then drew a 250-mile majority-minority district that snakes from the state’s northwest to Baton Rouge. The district isn’t compact and is barely contiguous. Non-black voters then challenged the new map as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A lower court agreed, saying the second district violated Gingles.

In the Court’s recent Allen v. Milligan decision (2023), Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals in requiring a second majority-minority district in Alabama because the minority population was compact. The other four Justices wrote in dissent that the majority misapplied Gingles and contended that courts should “apply a race-neutral benchmark” in deciding whether maps violate Section 2.

Yet Justice Kavanaugh emphasized in a concurring opinion that “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” This echoed the Court’s SFFA v. Harvard decision striking down racial preferences in college admissions. Map-making now may be the only field in which government sorting by race remains legal.

The Court began to slide shut the door to racial gerrymandering in its landmark Shelby County (2013) decision, which struck down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 4 pre-clearance formula. The Court held that the formula was an anachronism from the Jim Crow era and didn’t account for racial progress. The same is true of the Gingles interpretation of Section 2.

As Louisiana argues, “race-based redistricting rests on an invidious stereotype: that all minorities, by virtue of their membership in their racial class, think alike and share the same interests and voting preferences.”

Justice Clarence Thomas has been making this argument for years in eloquent dissents, and he wrote last term that the Court’s “Janus-like election-law jurisprudence” has created an “intractable conflict between this Court’s interpretation” of Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause. The result is that “states do not know how to draw maps that ‘survive both constitutional and VRA review.’”

Consider Texas, which was sued by the Biden Justice Department for not drawing enough majority-minority districts. With that case pending in the courts, the Trump Justice Department threatened a legal challenge claiming several districts were “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” Texas Republicans this summer used the Trump threat as an excuse to redraw the districts to increase their partisan advantage. Now they are being sued again under Section 2.

The Justices would do the country and themselves a favor by correcting the Gingles error and declaring that the Constitution forbids race-based map-making. As the Chief wrote in a 2006 redistricting opinion, “it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.”

The Guardian says the relief is real, but will Palestinian suffering end?

The reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, the release of the living hostages has led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due to uncertainty about who is being freed and where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return to dig through rubble for the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.

As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefire appeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined a high-powered peace summit of more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination in Mr Trump’s plan gives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.

The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidents Obama and Biden. This despite the Biden administration a year ago having attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.

A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.

Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid – and food and medicines must be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, with Sir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.

Strong international support for the Palestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump’s crackdowns on student visas

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

So declared Donald Trump in 2015, kicking off a presidential campaign rooted in hatred, fear and xenophobic myth — though at least tempered by the “good people” afterthought.

But 10 years later, it turns out “good people” from around the world aren’t welcomed in Trump’s America, either. Even foreign college students here legally and on their own dime to study in America’s great universities — the very definition of the “best of the best” — are getting the signal loud and clear that this president doesn’t want them here.

In St. Louis, as around the nation, colleges and universities have seen their enrollment of foreign students here on student visas plummet this year. Some of it’s due to stricter student visa requirements the administration is imposing for no good reason. Others are choosing not to come here out of concern about whether they will be allowed to stay and work after graduation — a concern exacerbated by the administration’s new $100,000 H-1B work visa fee on American employers who want to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.

Still others, presumably, are repelled by the toxic and increasingly brazen anti-immigrant rhetoric from the MAGA movement and its expanding campaign to rid America of anyone not born here.

That campaign is especially self-destructive when it comes to supporting American higher education. Unlike most American-born college students, foreign students who study here generally are paying top tuition rates, a financial lifeline for institutions that have struggled with diminishing public funding and declining enrollment by American-born students.

As the Post-Dispatch’s Monica Obradovic reports, a survey of four St. Louis-area universities found a drop in international enrollment of more than 2,700 students this year compared to last. St. Louis University alone has dropped by more than 1,500 international students. Washington University in St. Louis is down almost 1,000 foreign students. Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville is down 15%.

It’s part of a national trend that has dire implications for America’s economy. The NAFSA Association of International Educators estimates that foreign students contribute close to $44 billion to the economy annually, including supporting more than 378,000 jobs here. The New York Times reported this month that nearly 20% fewer international students arrived in the U.S. for the start of the current school year in August compared to last year. That’s the largest one-year drop on record except for the 2020 pandemic year.

Some of the administration’s student visa revocations have been in response to foreign students engaging in peaceful protest against U.S. policy regarding Gaza and other controversies. That’s a shameful statement to the world about how little our current president values our own First Amendment.

But most of the decline in international students is due to stricter student visa restrictions, travel bans from specific countries — and students simply (and understandably) declining to come here because of the current xenophobic political climate fueled by this administration. A spokesperson for Webster University in St. Louis County, for example, told the Post-Dispatch’s Obradovic that the private school has seen international enrollment fall at its three domestic campuses in favor of its seven foreign campuses.

The issue is bigger than money. International students tend to be the best and the brightest from their countries. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that fully one in four billion-dollar American startups have founders or co-founders who initially came here as international students. George Mason University reported in 2024 that almost one-third of Nobel laureates affiliated with American academic institutions were born somewhere else.

In terms of both economic and intellectual benefit to the U.S., these are exactly the “good people” Trump alluded to a decade ago. Yet under his current regime, they’re being expelled, barred or just convinced to stay away in record numbers. We’re all the poorer for it.

ITER, striving to distribute knowledge rather than produce commercial energy, is like the public library of fusion.","Real stars, the ones in space, are simple beasts. Our sun formed some 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud consisting of essentially one ingredient: hydrogen, the most basic and abundant element in the universe. Gravity kneaded the cloud into a big, rotating ball and kept squeezing from there, density and warmth spiking, until its core reached about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.

Hydrogen crumbles when collisions occur at this temperature and pressure, creating the soupy jumble of atomic parts known as plasma, the fourth state of matter after solid, liquid, and gas. Though rare on Earth outside of lightning bolts and neon signs, plasma accounts for over 99 percent of the solar system’s mass, most of it stored, highly agitated, in the sun. Throughout the sun’s soup, trillions of times every instant, four hydrogen atoms lock together in a series of steps to make helium. With a much higher fusion point, helium bobs placidly amid the solar havoc, a sturdy lifeboat, not even breaking a sweat at 27 million degrees—and there’s enough hydrogen in the sun to keep forging helium for another five billion years.

One further process takes place in each of these nuclear fusion reactions. A helium atom is just a speck lighter than four hydrogen atoms, and the leftover bits of matter, unleashed and energetic, thrash through the plasma, shimmy gradually to the sun’s surface, and stream into space. Those headed in the right direction deliver morsels of heat and light to Earth.

Here’s how mighty our sun is: The total energy it produces each second would power the entire Earth, gluttonously, for hundreds of thousands of years. And the process by which a star does this seems tantalizingly easy. What if we could create a smaller sun here on Earth and tap into its power? Then, theoretically, we’d have a virtually unlimited source of clean and cheap energy, emitting no carbon dioxide, potentially halting global warming and environmental collapse. The world would literally be saved. It sounds improbable, but such an endeavor has long been under way at a vast construction site in the south of France, where both the hard science and the need for human collaboration are unprecedented and unpredictable, and the dream of a better future can be witnessed coming to life.

The artificial star is called ITER (pronounced “eater”), the Latin word for “the way” and an acronym for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The 100-acre work area, pancake flat, is an hour’s drive inland from the Mediterranean Sea, tucked amid pine forests and vineyards, with craggy hills on the horizon.

Each weekday, more than 2,000 people, physicists to welders, arrive at the site. Smaller crews toil at night. Thirty-three nations representing half the world’s population are official ITER members, and workers from 90 countries have been involved in its creation—a web of cultures knitting a singular machine. In the middle of the jobsite, dominating the view, a windowless cement edifice rises like a volcano.

To enter this structure, you must visit the attached dressing room and swap your footwear for white clean-room shoes, then use the electric shoe scrubber to ensure that any dirt or contaminants are gone, and march in place on a sticky mat to eliminate gunk on the soles. The machine being built needs to be kept fastidiously pristine. A dropped pen cap or stray fingerprint could cause damage. You also have to wear a white lab coat, a hairnet, a hard hat, protective eyewear, and white gloves.

Once properly dressed, you pass through a plastic strip curtain and unzip a canvas flap, like a tent door, and zip it shut behind you. Then walk down a narrow corridor, fluorescently lit, the walls, floor, and ceiling all the same bright white as your shoes. The air is still and stifling.

At the end of the hallway, unzip and rezip another door, navigate a second white corridor, climb up a layer of scaffolding jungle-gym style, and duck through one more zippered portal. There’s a claustrophobic sense of being lost in a labyrinth. Traverse yet another dizzying white hallway and open a further door and there you are, inside the great machine room.

A lot of the metal is burnished to a brilliant shine, many pieces plated in silver, an ideal material for deflecting heat from sensitive components. Pipes run here and there in parallel rows like raked sand in Zen gardens, wending through the works. The heart of the machine is in the form of a giant sphere, with a doughnut-shaped hollow where plasma may one day whirl. The device is called a tokamak. There are few sharp edges on a tokamak, and massive segments of ITER’s machinery are sculpted with graceful, sandstone-like curves.

ITER is publicly funded, billions of dollars shouldered by dozens of governments, with no profit motive or military aim. “We are contributing to world peace,” says Kijung Jung, head of the project’s South Korean unit, expressing an admirable objective that is somewhat belied by decades of international disputes. The project is open source; if ITER operates as planned, any nation or private company can access its intellectual property, free of charge. This is not going to happen soon. The quest for a mechanical star has been unfolding for a century, and still has years to go.

But in a world that can feel quick-tempered and fractious, ITER appears to be a crazily ambitious long-term project rooted in optimism and a desire for unity. The endeavor has already extended across careers and lifetimes, with each step forward seemingly offset by unanticipated setbacks. “It will be a savior for future generations,” promises Dutch physicist Akko Maas, a 25-year veteran of ITER, speaking from his office overlooking the teeming construction area. A few scientists have observed that ITER may be our era’s version of the Egyptian pyramids or the Gothic cathedrals of Europe. Some visitors permitted to see the machine have been moved to tears, for it can seem a miracle that ITER exists at all.

Other observers, including some of the most powerful voices in science, have not been swayed by ITER’s charms. Three separate Nobel Prize winners in physics—Pierre-Gilles de Gennes of France, his countryman Georges Charpak, and Masatoshi Koshiba of Japan—independently declared that attempts to create a miniature sun to help power the Earth are a waste of money and effort, doomed to fizzle out, and possibly dangerous.

Despite such criticism, an ITER-like facility, if completed and hooked to the energy grid, would presumably be safer, cleaner, and more productive than any nuclear power plant now in use. All of the world’s 400-plus nuclear reactors operating across some 30 nations rely on fission. Fusion and fission are similar-looking words based on the same concept of creating energy from excess matter in atomic reactions, but otherwise they’re opposites. In a fusion plant, lightweight atoms—hydrogen has just one electron, one proton, and zero, one, or two neutrons—are forced together. With fission, heavier elements such as uranium or plutonium, each with a total of more than 300 electrons, protons, and neutrons, are split apart.

The great advantage of fission is that reactions are easy to start. One good jolt and particles drop from the big atoms like fruit from a tree. But fission is messy—some of the radioactive waste will be toxic to humans for tens of thousands of years. Fusion, too, produces hazardous radioactive by-products, but nothing remotely comparable. Also, fissile material like uranium may be depleted within a century, while the type of hydrogen best suited for fusion is almost endlessly abundant in seawater.

There’s also fission’s limited but unavoidable record of catastrophe: Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, in 1979; Chernobyl, Ukraine (then part of the U.S.S.R.), in 1986; Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Fission reactions, without careful control, can become explosive, prone to gallop off uncontrollably. With fusion, runaway reactions and meltdowns aren’t possible. In a fusion plant, any accident or system failure, or even a small instability in the plasma, immediately causes the reaction to lose strength and extinguish itself.

Also, fusion produces four times as much energy as fission with the same quantity of fuel. And fusion is about four million times more energetic, and vastly cleaner, than chemical reactions that burn oil or coal. Renewable energy sources including solar, wind, and geothermal are, like nuclear power, largely carbon free, but none of them appear capable of scaling up to meet global demand.

Fusion fills the bill of energy savior, except that it’s difficult to begin the reaction and harder to maintain it. Atoms naturally repel one another, and enormous forces are required to slam them together and fuse them. Even then, plasma is skittish and fragile, constantly seeking to dissipate. The largest detonation of all time, the big bang, could maintain fusion for only three minutes before it faded away. For the next hundred million years, fusion didn’t exist in the universe, until gravity muscled enough hydrogen together for the first stars to ignite. Virtually every lab experiment involving fusion has consumed more energy than it has produced, contrary to the goal of a power plant.

Fusion energy currently sits at the maddening intersection of conceptual simplicity and technological perplexity. Some fusion experts have concluded, across several decades now, that controlling fusion is beyond the limits of human capability.

Daniel Jassby, who worked at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab for 25 years, wrote after his retirement that a fusion plant would be too convoluted, requiring endless maintenance, and “cause more problems than it would solve.” The late Lawrence Lidsky, an associate director of MIT’s fusion center and founding editor of the Journal of Fusion Energy, declared after a long career that fusion power is a fantasy, noting that it’s widely regarded as “the hardest scientific and technical problem ever tackled.” Walter Marshall, former chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, reportedly said that “fusion is an idea with infinite possibility and zero chance of success.”

There’s no shortage of scientists who support ITER—Stephen Hawking once said that fusion was the single idea with the greatest potential to advance humanity—but the project’s detractors mostly articulate the same idea: ITER’s complexity can seem absurd.

The more you know about the machine, the less it may appear to make sense. “This is high risk, high reward,” says Kathryn McCarthy, director of the United States’ ITER bureau. The idea is undeniably a long shot, possibly a wild-goose chase, that might in fact exceed human capacity. But for many who’ve dedicated their working lives to ITER, it’s precisely this uncertainty and absurdity that make the effort alluring. How can we know our limits unless we try our hardest to exceed them?

Achief absurdity is the heat. Of the three fusion requirements, plasma confinement, pressure, and heat, humans are most limited by pressure. A million Earths could fit inside the sun, and this size difference is insurmountable—the center of the sun is 13 times denser than lead. There’s no known way we can create a squeeze like that on our planet.

To make up for this, a lot of heat is needed. The main source of ITER’s heat comes from a pair of giant laserlike particle guns called neutral beam injectors. Each gun is the size of two city buses parked end to end; their barrels point into the tokamak. They will fire one-million-volt particle beams continuously for an hour. To power the guns and other components, ITER has built a 10-acre electrical switchyard capable of drawing as much energy from the French national grid as a city of one million people, though the machine, once operational, should prove that this debt can be repaid at least tenfold.

When the guns open fire, hydrogen gas in the tokamak will swirl through the doughnut, increasing in velocity as the temperature rises—one million degrees Fahrenheit, two million, 10 million. The atoms will move faster than the speed of sound, then swifter still, as the heat exceeds the 27 million degrees at the center of the sun, then passes 50 million, 100 million, 200 million. The force of accelerating particles in the tokamak will equal that of two space shuttles launching at once. Only at 270 million degrees, 10 times the temperature of the sun’s core, will hydrogen atoms in ITER collide and shed electrons, then fuse together as helium.

How do you contain something so hot? No known material could do it. A tokamak made of pure diamonds would vaporize instantly. But here the nature of plasma is helpful—the stew of atomic parts includes a large number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. Since these particles are affected by magnetic forces, the jar confining ITER’s plasma will be formed of electromagnetic fields.

Like many ideas being implemented at ITER, the development of the electromagnetic system draws on the most promising discoveries from years of research at laboratories worldwide that have nothing to do with nuclear fusion. The magnets at ITER, also absurd, start with the central solenoid, which will fill the hole of the doughnut. It’s like a grain silo six stories high, and will become the backbone of the world’s most powerful magnetic system, generating forces that could lift an aircraft carrier out of the water. Circling the machine like Hula-Hoops will be six immense poloidal magnets, and hanging vertically will be 18 D-shaped toroidal magnets, each over 50 feet tall, enclosing the plasma’s loop. Together the magnets will weigh more than 11,000 tons, and they must be machined with extraordinary precision, the margin for error less than the thickness of a sheet of paper. “To create this,” says one ITER worker, “you have to be a little crazy.”

These are all superconducting magnets, which means that they can carry strong electrical currents without resistance, allowing the intense fields required to corral ITER’s plasma. For superconductivity to work, these magnets must be kept extremely cold. ITER has also built a cryoplant big enough to house a soccer field—“the most complicated refrigerator in the world,” as an ITER cryogenic engineer put it—that will circulate liquid helium through the magnets.

ITER’s magnets need to be cooled to negative 450 degrees Fahrenheit. This is just a few ticks above absolute zero, the point at which atomic energy has reached its minimum, nearly motionless state. Perhaps the ultimate absurdity of ITER is that it will contain one of the hottest known places in the universe and one of the coldest, little more than a body’s length apart. “We are playing with Mother Nature’s forces,” says Alberto Loarte, director of ITER’s science division, jotting down a page of mathematical calculations showing just how great these forces are. “I can’t predict the difficulties we will face. We may learn that we understand nothing.”

Here’s how it’s supposed to work: The doughnut-shaped area in the tokamak will be pumped clear, forming a vacuum—any stray molecules can pollute the plasma. The magnets will be supercooled and activated, then hydrogen gas will be injected into the vacuum chamber at about half a gram per second. This gas will be heavier than common hydrogen. ITER’s recipe calls for a combination of deuterium, which adds one neutron to the normally neutronless atom, and tritium, which adds two.

Without these isotopes, the tokamak would have to be heated hundreds of millions of degrees higher, yet this efficiency also brings complications. Deuterium, though rare, can be plucked out of seawater; our oceans contain a many-million-year global supply. But tritium doesn’t naturally occur, and is slightly radioactive, so ITER will also be testing first-of-a-kind components that, it’s hoped, will permit the machine to safely breed its own tritium.

Once the neutral beam injectors have zapped the gas to the necessary 270 million degrees, the resulting plasma will glow faintly red, like an aurora—the northern and southern lights are also plasmas—and, says an ITER physicist, emit a sound like the screech of an alley cat. Newly fused helium atoms will drop out of the plasma, a sort of ash, and collect in a huge dish known as the divertor at the bottom of the tokamak.

Heavy hydrogen will continually be added, keeping the plasma fed. Another benefit of using deuterium and tritium is that about half of the fusion reaction’s by-products are neutrons. Neutrons, well named, are neutral, unaffected by magnetism. Loose neutrons will fly through the plasma in all directions and crash against the walls of the tokamak, striking what’s called the blanket.

ITER’s blanket, not soft, is formed from hunks of tungsten, steel, aluminum, and bronze, designed to absorb this hailstorm of neutrons, hundreds of trillions per second, and transfer the heat of the particles’ kinetic energy from inside the tokamak to outside. In an actual fusion power plant, this heat could be used to boil water, creating steam, which can spin turbines and generate electricity.

More than a hundred years of effort and money have already been devoted to achieving these minutes. Painted across the lobby of the five-story ITER headquarters building, home to administrative offices and scientific think tanks, is a timeline of fusion milestones. It begins in 1919, when French physicist Jean Perrin hypothesized that stars produce energy through fusion. This was definitively proved in the 1930s, and soon after the power of fusion was grasped, scientists set about trying to kill people with it.

The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 used only fission. After World War II, the global arms race escalated, and the U.S. initiated a project to weaponize fusion. On November 1, 1952, the first hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike—a two-stage explosive using fission and fusion—completely eliminated one of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, a blast equal to 700 Hiroshimas. This was just the start, as scientists swiftly realized that fission-fusion hybrid bombs could be boosted exponentially. The threat of destroying the planet with a single weapon was real.

Global powers attempted to change that trajectory. In 1953, U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower delivered what is known as the Atoms for Peace address at the United Nations in New York City, in which he called on “the entire body of the world’s scientists and engineers” to abandon the military use of atomic reactions and instead adapt their studies “to the arts of peace.”

Most scientists focused on fission, but a handful of researchers, regarded by some mainstream academics at the time as mavericks or dreamers or con artists, realized that fusion was the ultimate, world-changing prize, and set about trying to utilize it. The first generation of fusion machines, incorporating mirrors or lasers or electric currents, all ended in miserable failure. Some simply didn’t work or were exposed as frauds, while others formed plasma that lasted a fraction of a second before collapsing.

Plasma, physicists learned, was a fiendish substance. Containing it has been compared to wrapping jelly in rubber bands. Volatilities in plasma—events that snuff the reaction—were given descriptive names: kink instability, sausage instability, bump-in-tail. The list totals more than 50. By the time of the Second United Nations International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1958, world leaders generally agreed that all nations’ nuclear energy research should be declassified and shared. The Soviet Union, concurring, disclosed a breakthrough that was later given the name tokamak, a shortening of the Russian phrase “toroidal chamber with magnetic coil.”

The tokamak was an elegant design that could achieve hotter plasmas and longer confinement times than anything before. No fusion device had ever been more promising, and scientists calculated that bigger tokamaks would provide the volume needed to maintain plasma in a stable and energetic state. By the late 1970s, three separate giant tokamaks were in development: in Princeton, New Jersey; Oxfordshire, England; and Naka, Japan. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on each one, and optimism surged. But years passed in which none of these new machines came close to proving that fusion was economically feasible. Fusion, observers like to say, is 20 years away—and always will be.

At a juncture when fusion could’ve easily been abandoned, it was unexpectedly revived. In 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. president Ronald Reagan held a summit in Geneva, their first ever meeting. The agreement they reached included a declaration that the two nations, and any other countries willing to join them, would work together to build a fusion reactor “for the benefit of all mankind.” And thus from the endgame of the Cold War was born ITER.

Bickering and infighting commenced immediately. ITER is inhuman in scope—hot, cold, immense, subatomic—yet can also seem like the most human thing ever, bloated by geopolitics, red tape, and hubris. Two dozen European countries and Japan promptly joined the alliance, and with no nation holding majority control, haggling began over ITER’s technical design and cost. The squabbling dragged on for years, through the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991—Russia remained with ITER—and bureaucratically onward into 1998, when the U.S., having spent $345 million on what some officials felt was basically nothing, quit the project.

The battle over where to build the machine consumed more years of politicking, ultimately coming down to France or Japan. A compromise was reached, and it was decided that there would be a Japanese director general and a French worksite. Ground was broken in January 2007, a mere 21 years after the Gorbachev and Reagan accord in Geneva.

Seven more years of preparatory work ensued—clearing and leveling the site, then creating an elaborate foundation fitted with shock absorbers to protect the machine from potential earthquakes. Just over a decade ago, in 2014, construction finally began on the monumental tokamak housing, the centerpiece of the 39 buildings and technical areas sprawled across ITER’s campus. Specialists in dozens of fields, plasma physics to electromagnetics to cement pouring, were recruited and hired. The ITER site has its own bus system, plying the paved perimeter roads, while dirt lanes in the middle are a cacophony of forklifts, dump trucks, and backhoes, with teams of hard-hatted workers marching around on foot. In late 2018, the first of the machine’s 10 million pieces was put into place.

These pieces are being manufactured by member nations across the globe, then shipped to the worksite in France. The chief contribution of the U.S. is the central solenoid, the megamagnet, which is being built by General Atomics, a family-owned business in San Diego. Russia is contributing additional magnets and superconducting materials. Europe is creating some of the main tokamak hardware, and South Korea the rest. India is supplying cooling system apparatuses; Japan is fashioning heating structures. About 5,000 companies worldwide have been involved in the effort.

Some parts made abroad are the size of a basketball court and weigh more than a passenger jet. Many are heavily wrapped and encased in a protective frame before being loaded onto a cargo ship. From Asian countries, the trip to France takes more than a month. The package is then balanced on a barge and floated up a canal and across a lake. The last 65 miles are on roads, which were reinforced and widened, permitting a 352-wheeled transport platform to creep at three miles an hour all night for three or four nights to arrive at ITER.

How much will all of this cost? It’s hard to know exactly, as there is no official global accounting. The ITER agreement signed in 2006 claimed that the entire project, including the value of items made by members, would cost around six billion dollars, start to finish. That price has ballooned to $65 billion, more than 10 times the original estimate, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. (ITER disputes that figure.) If it alters the course of civilization, fusion supporters say, it’ll be seen as a bargain—even the new figure represents less than three days of current global expenditures on energy—but ITER will be, by far, the most expensive scientific instrument on Earth.

Many of ITER’s delays and cost overruns have been self-inflicted—an internal assessment of ITER’s management practices detailed pricey design changes and administrative gridlock—but some have been beyond the project’s control: storms at sea, pirates in the Suez Canal. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan interrupted parts production there for a year. The COVID pandemic slowed the world for two more. Yet through everything ITER churned inexorably on.

Then came an extraordinary accomplishment. ITER may be the world’s largest jigsaw puzzle, but the most essential construction, the tokamak and attached components, has been reduced to nine massive pieces, called vacuum vessel modules. These will fit together like segments of an orange. Each weighs about 1,500 tons. To move one, ITER had to invent several new lifting machines. Workers rehearsed the sequence of events that needed to happen. And on May 12, 2022, the first module, made of parts supplied by almost every ITER member, was tucked perfectly into its spot.

The milestone, decades in the making, was a celebrated ITER triumph. Now that one module was in place, the other eight would surely follow. After all the hurdles, the machine was going to get built, and switched on. There was light at the end of the tunnel.

And then the project nearly self-destructed.

ITER is entirely dependent on funding from federal governments, which can be fickle sources of money. Politicians like to hear about success and momentum, even when the reality is, according to the internal ITER report, that management is blundering and the engineering challenges are more formidable than anticipated. Some cheerleading by the project’s leadership is expected—in 2015, the U.S. was reportedly considering a second ITER exit, and in order to stay, needed to be convinced that progress was coming. But what happened at ITER is that showmanship seemed to have eclipsed honesty, and in a project of exacting, revolutionary science, this was bound to bring disaster.

The placement of the vacuum vessel module in 2022 generated glowing news reports from major trade publications. The job, however, was apparently done in a corner-cutting rush. Inspections revealed tiny cracks and pinhole leaks. The tokamak was compromised. The module couldn’t be repaired where it was, wedged tight, and the installation couldn’t be reversed without partially tearing the machine apart. Workers didn’t know what to do, and construction of the tokamak ground to a halt.

At the very moment ITER needed decisive leadership, there was none. Two days after the module was hung, the director general of ITER, Bernard Bigot, died of an illness at age 72. Bigot, a French physicist, was ITER’s third chief, following two Japanese directors, Kaname Ikeda and Osamu Motojima. All three executives seemed to succumb, at least somewhat, to the organizational malaise known as “big project syndrome.” A warehouse at ITER is filled with parts that nobody knows who ordered or why. The head of communications before Bigot’s tenure, Michel Claessens, later admitted that ITER’s public statements often contained “lies, propaganda, and misinformation,” creating an atmosphere that resulted in the reckless installation of the vacuum vessel module.

An Italian electrical engineer named Pietro Barabaschi, who has a long history in fusion, was appointed by the project’s governing body, the ITER Council, to take over. Approachable, energetic, informal—he often comes to work in jeans and running shoes, and everyone calls him Pietro—he seems comfortable amid chaos. He’s 59 years old, lanky and tall, and speaks fluent Italian, English, and German, as well as workable French. Taming fusion, says Pietro, is like humans learning to harness fire for the second time in history. Being burned by mistakes is inevitable, and he publicly pledged that ITER would be transparent about them, and even published an article in the science journal Nature Reviews Physics titled “The Importance of Documenting Failure.” Pietro’s first major decision as director was that the vacuum vessel module would be removed, at enormous expense and multiple years of holdup. Either the project would be done right, he implied, or it wouldn’t be done at all.

The sentiment among ITER workers seemed to be that Pietro clearly made the right choice, and might have just killed the project. “I thought that was it, the end of ITER,” says communications officer Sabina Griffith, who has worked at the site for almost two decades. Lola Zedet, an ITER construction coordinator, said that the news of the module’s removal was both understandable and shocking. After the insane scramble to get the vacuum vessel module in place, the world had been turned upside down. “Shifts of people were looking at each other and doing nothing,” says Zedet. “It was almost surreal.” But after some time and mental recalibration, she says, the crews returned to work, and the unbuilding of ITER began.

Many fusion experts believe that success is more probable from a nimble private company motivated by profit than from an overstuffed public project like ITER. There are currently more than a hundred private fusion initiatives worldwide battling for a potentially epic grand prize of an energy fortune.

ITER’s avuncular stance is that there isn’t competition at all—the true dream is fusion energy for the globe, and the more places attempting it, the better the chance it will happen. Private firms are welcome to visit the site, to study what’s worked and what hasn’t, and to tap into a fount of hard-earned wisdom. ITER, striving to distribute knowledge rather than produce commercial energy, is like the public library of fusion. Also, ITER shares the results of its extensive diagnostics and testing on parts and materials, allowing others to save time and money, and push on. It appears unlikely that any private firm will make the public effort obsolete.

From the outside, it seemed like ITER was going backward right through to the end of 2024, each day further from completion, the machine dismantled, the vacuum vessel module pulled out and then itself disassembled, then tests to determine the course of repairs. But on the vast campus, the culture had shifted toward progress. In Pietro’s view, so many elements of the project were pioneering, entering the realm of the unknown, that ITER was like a scientific Lewis and Clark. They’d gotten lost for a while in the wilderness, but had reorganized and streamlined the management structure, and soon would be navigating smoothly again. For every problem that may be encountered, Pietro believes, there exists a reasonable solution. Government funding during this reset did not dry up.

In April 2025, just shy of three years since the vacuum vessel module had first been installed, it was put in again and the project was back to zero. Two months later, the second segment was mounted. The remaining seven are all in various stages of completion. The jobsite is buzzing, welding sparks flying from the construction zones, cranes swinging through the sky, physicists scribbling on whiteboards.

Pietro, putting in 12-hour days, bounces from meeting to meeting, often taking a total of six minutes for lunch, enough to wolf down a sandwich or salad. “It’s both a sprint and a marathon,” he says of ITER, “with surprises around every corner.” But no matter how crammed his schedule, Pietro tries to observe two traditions. A couple of times a week, he puts on a hard hat and protective gear and goes alone to observe the tokamak construction, climbing up the scaffolding to get to his favorite spot, at the very top, with a bird’s-eye view of the machine, all of the ambition and folly and genius of it. He just takes it in for a while, the sound of hammering echoing continuously, a metallic smell in the air. Then gets back to work.

Mission over emissions For more than 25 years, the U.S. military planned for climate change.
“The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap,” he wrote in a March posting on X.","Retired Marine Corps gunnery sergeant Vida Rivera knows heat can be as dangerous as any enemy.

Early in her military career, she collapsed from heat exhaustion while carrying a 65-pound pack on a sweltering hike in Quantico, Virginia. Years later in Afghanistan, Rivera drove a truck in temperatures nearing 120 degrees. But she was ready. She’d taken a mechanics course — twice — to make sure she could fix the truck’s air conditioning if it failed.

She knew extreme heat could incapacitate her Marines. “They need water and good temps like everybody,” she said.

Across the U.S. military, climate change isn’t a distant threat. It’s a daily challenge. The fallout from a warming planet has hit the military hard, sidelining more than 10,000 troops since 2018, flooding bases and undermining everything from runways to nuclear readiness.

Extreme weather is battering installations from Guam to North Carolina and fueling instability in regions overseas where American forces may be called to intervene.

For decades, the Pentagon viewed climate change as a national security threat — not for environmental reasons, but because it undermined operations and readiness.

Now the Trump administration is dismantling that approach. Pentagon leaders have cut climate research funding and abandoned adaptation plans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed global warming concerns as “climate change crap.”

Critics warn that the military is being forced to fly blind — and that the cost could be strategic vulnerability in a world where climate is increasingly shaping conflict.

“I think it puts our troops at risk,” said Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security. “… We’re going to be less prepared if our troops are deployed somewhere where it’s incredibly hot and their equipment doesn’t work right, or if they themselves can’t physically operate … That’s malpractice, I think.”

The Defense Department did not respond to Floodlight’s requests for public documents and an interview to discuss changes to its climate policy.

The Pentagon’s 2026 budget request recommends cutting $1.6 billion in “wasteful” climate spending. Among the targeted programs: a $6 million grant to decarbonize emissions from Navy ships. Where most of the remaining cuts would come from is unclear.

That marked a sharp break from the previous administration, when the Department of Defense sought $5 billion for climate initiatives in its fiscal 2024 budget — including efforts to harden bases against extreme weather and reduce battlefield fuel dependence.

How warming undermines U.S. military power

In September 2018, Hurricane Florence dumped 36 inches of rain on Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, creating a 13-foot storm surge and damaging more than 3,000 homes at the Marine Corps base and nearby air stations.

Just a month later, Hurricane Michael struck Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida with 160 mph winds, flipping fighter jets and damaging more than 600 buildings. The branch spent nearly $5 billion to repair and upgrade the base to become more resilient to future storms.

And in May 2023, Typhoon Mawar slammed Andersen Air Force base in Guam with 140 mph winds and 28 inches of rain. The storm upended cars, took out power lines and damaged nearly 500 buildings. It cost nearly $10 billion to repair and to harden the base against future extreme weather events.

According to the National Weather Service, unusually warm ocean temperatures supercharged all three storms.

These aren’t isolated events. Rising seas are projected to cause chronic flooding at coastal military bases in the coming decades. By 2050, half of coastal bases could each face 270 or more flood events each year, according to a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Major storms can hobble nuclear deterrence, too. Hurricanes could damage submarines or delay the transport of nuclear warheads, warned researcher Jamie Kwong, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. All three nuclear delivery systems — air, land and water — could be hampered by climate change, she said.

Training and lives at risk

Since 2022, the U.S. military has been deployed to more than 230 climate emergencies, according to the nonprofit Center for Climate and Security.

Much of that work has fallen to the National Guard. Over the past decade, the National Guard put in nearly 4 million days of service responding to hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, the Pentagon said in a recent report to four Democratic U.S. senators who had requested the information.

And heat-related illnesses among troops are climbing. From 2020 to 2024, the annual rate of heat exhaustion among service members jumped 52%. In 2024 alone, troops suffered more than 2,800 heat-related illnesses.

Fort Benning has long had a problem with excessive heat. Stretching across 182,000 hot and muggy acres in west-central Georgia straddling the Alabama state line, it’s one of the Army’s top training centers — and it has recorded more heat-related illnesses than any other U.S. military base. Until about a decade ago, someone there was dying from the heat every three years.

That crisis led to the 2019 creation of the U.S. Army’s Heat Center at Fort Benning, where military personnel are taught how to prevent and treat heat-related illnesses.

Officers there developed techniques like arm immersion — lowering soldiers’ arms into cold water during training breaks to reduce body temperature — and ice sheeting, where frozen bed sheets are wrapped around overheated troops to bring down body heat quickly.

To reduce the risk of heat illnesses, the military generally suspends nonessential outdoor activities on extremely hot days. One such instance occurred in August, when a heat wave gripping the Korean Peninsula forced U.S. and South Korean forces to postpone half of their field training exercises.

These so-called “black flag” days— generally 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above — are becoming more common at many military bases, according to a 2023 Defense Department report.

As global temperatures rise, the military may have to suspend summer training at its hottest bases and “spend a heck of a lot of money” to relocate that training, predicts Caroline Baxter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for education and training under the Biden administration.

It’s not just troops who suffer. Military planes and ships are affected, too. Hot, humid air is less dense, which means planes struggle to generate the lift they need and can’t carry as much cargo. In fact, a 2019 Climate and Security brief warns that hotter, more humid air will force military aircraft to reduce payloads — or abandon missions entirely.

During the 2016 raid to capture Osama bin Laden, one of the Black Hawk helicopters sustained severe damage during a hard landing. President Barack Obama emphasized the impact that the hot temperature had on the incident.

Warm seawater, meanwhile, makes it harder to cool ship engines, while melting glaciers dilute ocean salinity, which can compromise the effectiveness of sonar.

As the world warms, it’s bringing more droughts and food shortages to fragile areas, contributing to problems that threaten national security interests, the U.S. Army said in its 2022 climate strategy document.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led the military response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, noted that drought caused by global warming helped trigger the 2011 Syrian civil war and the later armed conflict in Sudan. He has since founded the Green Army, an organization that fights toxic pollution in Louisiana.

“You can change your policy to not consider the impact of global warming on your strategic posture,” Honoré said, “but … the heat will cause a disruption to global stability as well as security. And it will continue to have a human impact on our day-to-day training and operational readiness.”

Melting Arctic ice also increases the potential for military conflict, experts say, because it’s opening up shipping lanes that were once inaccessible. Contested economic and military activities between Russia and other Arctic nations “will increase the risk of miscalculation,” a 2023 threat assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community warned.

“What that really means is there is an accident waiting to happen,” according to “Threat Multiplier,” a book by Sherri Goodman, who as deputy undersecretary of defense led the military’s environmental efforts during the Clinton administration.

Mission over emissions

For more than 25 years, the U.S. military planned for climate change.

The Department of Defense developed its first climate change strategy in 1998 and a decade later declared global warming a national security issue. After Joe Biden took office, the military’s focus on climate impacts took on new urgency.

“Climate change is an existential threat to our nation’s security,” then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2021, “and the Department of Defense must act swiftly and boldly to take on this challenge and prepare for damage that cannot be avoided.”

For the Pentagon, climate change wasn’t just about the environment — it was about how and where troops could operate.

“How do I continue to do my job despite the fact that the operational environment is changing?” said John Conger, a former high-ranking Defense Department official who later ran the Center for Climate and Security. “ …You’re not thinking about emissions, you’re thinking about missions.”

In 2022, the U.S. Army began rolling out its first hybrid tactical vehicles. There was a practical reason for that, too: Hybrids are quieter and consume less fuel, which can save lives in combat.

“We were losing marines and soldiers in the constant movement of fuel to the front in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Goodman wrote in her book. “For every 24 fuel convoys in Afghanistan, one soldier was killed.”

Some Pentagon projects aimed at boosting effectiveness and efficiency have also spun off climate-friendly civilian innovations. For example, the military’s work with General Motors on hydrogen fuel cells produced fast-charging, off-grid power units that could speed electric car charging.

New doctrine: Climate doesn’t matter anymore

President Donald Trump has pushed to rechristen the Department of Defense as the “Department of War.” And Hegseth has made it clear that the Pentagon’s priorities have shifted.

“The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap,” he wrote in a March posting on X. “We do training and warfighting.”

On March 17, Hegseth issued a memo banning Pentagon agencies from spending money on climate planning and ordering leaders to “remove all references to climate change and related subjects from mission statements.”

Hegseth doubled down on his message in his Sept. 30 address to hundreds of military leaders at Quantico, declaring there would be “no more climate change worship” in the U.S. military.

The secretary’s March directive does leave room for the continuation of some weather-related work, including risk assessments, environmental reviews and base resilience improvements.

But the Pentagon also announced it’s canceling 91 studies focused on climate and social science research. The move will save $30 million — a tiny fraction of the department’s $850 billion budget. That research was designed to help military planners anticipate emerging security threats, including climate change, extremism and disinformation.

‘We’re not going to be ready’

Cutting those grants is short-sighted, says Tom Ellison, deputy director of the Center for Climate and Security. His group, working with Virginia Tech, was slated to get $2 million to study how rising seas and extreme weather could fuel instability in the Philippines, Guam and Japan — regions important to U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific. But in March, they learned the grant was canceled.

“These research projects answer key questions about not just climate change, but a variety of issues shaping the world in which the US military operates, including migration, technology, ideology, public opinion, etc.” Ellison wrote in an email to Floodlight.

“Moreover,” he added, “they do it for relative pennies,” noting the Pentagon spends $30 million “roughly every 20 minutes.”

Climate action plans from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard have quietly disappeared from public websites in recent months. The Pentagon also shut down its climate resilience portal.

Baxter, the former deputy assistant defense secretary, helped build that portal, which she called a vital hub for validated climate data.

Said Conger, the former Center for Climate and Security director: “If you do not have complete information because you willfully ignore certain parts of the puzzle, you put yourself at a disadvantage — because the Russians and the Chinese aren’t ignoring it.”

Sikorsky, the center’s current director, agreed.

“It sends a message to our competitors and adversaries … ‘We’re going to be weak because we’re not going to be ready.’”

The Washington Post on the revival of the U.S.-China trade war

The United States and China, inveterate rivals yet inextricably interlinked, are once again barreling into a trade war nobody wants. Tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, coming after a few months respite, once again threaten to damage the economies of both countries and derail global growth.

China on Thursday blindsided the White House by announcing sweeping new curbs on the export of critical raw earth minerals and magnets, needed in everything from laptops and electric vehicles to U.S. military fighter jets, submarines and missiles. Beijing added five new elements to the seven already subject to stringent export controls.

President Donald Trump responded Friday by announcing new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as new export controls on critical technology destined for China. Trump also threatened to scuttle a planned meeting later this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asian leaders meeting in South Korea. That sit-down was supposed to lay the groundwork for a full-scale summit early next year.

Both sides left time for an off-ramp. China delayed the start of its new restrictions until Dec. 1. Trump delayed the imposition of his retaliatory measures until Nov. 1. This raises the possibility that the world’s two largest economies are mainly staking out hardline negotiating positions, with threats and ultimatums, to improve their bargaining positions.

Longer term, however, the past 48 hours point toward a looming era of increasing friction as the superpowers shift from competition with occasional cooperation to clashes and outright conflict.

China controls about 70 percent of the world’s rare earth mining and 90 percent of the global processing. It was entirely foreseeable that they would use this market power as a pressure point when Trump picked a fight with Xi earlier this year.

At the same time, China has its own pain points. The United States dominates in semiconductors and chip-design software that China cannot yet manufacture domestically and needs to compete in the artificial intelligence boom. The United States also remains the world’s largest consumer market and accounts for about 15 percent of their exports.

China’s willingness to play the rare earths card has pushed the United States to look elsewhere for alternative sources, something that America should have started doing decades ago. Despite the name, rare earths are actually not all that rare, but they are currently most easily and cheaply mined in China.

The United States has vast deposits of rare earths but significantly trails China and Brazil, partly because of deindustrialization but also because mining certain materials tends to create politically untenable levels of environmental damage. As a result, Trump has been looking to strike minerals deals with countries such as Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo and possibly even Myanmar or Venezuela — all of which are embroiled in conflict but have significant assets below ground.

Even more frustrating than needing access to Chinese minerals to keep the economy going is America’s dependence on them processing and transforming its own minerals into finished products. The United States now exports 95 percent of its rare earths to China for processing because it costs so much less than doing it here. Trying to increase domestic processing capacity could take a decade or more, and permitting remains too cumbersome and slow.

Before the blowup at the end of this week, the two sides had been making conciliatory gestures on trade and seemingly trying to dial down the rhetoric ahead of the heads of state meeting. Trump nixed a $400 million lethal arms package to Taiwan, the self-governing democracy which China considers a renegade province. Trump also lifted a ban on selling AI chips to China. Beijing, in turn, toughened controls on two of the precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, one of Trump’s demands. China also gave the preliminary okay for an American consortium to take 80 percent ownership of TikTok.

The bonhomie after summer trade talks in Geneva and London belied the reality that the United States and China are locked in a herculean struggle for influence and military superiority in the Asia-Pacific region that will define the 21st century. Escalating tensions have led some to speak fancifully of decoupling or delinking of the two economies.

The hard truth is that, for the foreseeable future, the United States and China remain mutually dependent. A trade war is in neither country’s interest. Since a divorce is unrealistic, at least anytime soon, it’s better Washington and Beijing go back to talking.

The New York Times says you should blame Trump when your energy bill goes up

You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.

The Wall Street Journal on SCOTUS and racial gerrymandering

Here we go again. The Supreme Court keeps getting dragged into redistricting fights involving race, and this week the Justices will rehear a racial gerrymander challenge to Louisiana’s Congressional map. It could be a landmark that ends the cynical use of race by both major parties to advance their partisan interests.

In recent years, the Justices have considered challenges to maps in Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. They punted last term on deciding the Louisiana case (Louisiana v. Callais) that they will reconsider Wednesday. They will also take up the question of whether the intentional creation of majority-minority districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the Fifteenth Amendment’s prohibition against abridging a citizen’s right to vote based on race. The right answer is yes.

State Legislatures are caught in a legal vise. If they draw maps that consider race too little, they can be found to violate Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. If they weigh race too much, they could run afoul of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.

Liberal groups sued Louisiana after Republicans redrew the state Congressional map following the 2020 Census. The map included one majority-minority district, but the plaintiffs said Section 2 requires a second. They reasoned that because blacks make up 30% of Louisiana’s voting-age population, two of the state’s six districts should be majority black.

Section 2 bars voting practices that discriminate based on race. It also guarantees that minorities have an equal opportunity “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Congress’s aim was to prevent minorities from being disenfranchised by the likes of poll taxes.

The law’s text doesn’t mention majority-minority districts and stresses that it doesn’t establish a right to proportional representation. But the Supreme Court’s muddled Gingles precedent (1986) read into the law a requirement to draw majority-minority districts on two conditions: when minority populations are large, compact and politically cohesive, and when the majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc” to defeat a minority’s “preferred candidate.”

Courts and legislatures have struggled to divine what this means. Must a minority group’s “preferred candidate” be of the same race? How should courts determine if a minority population is “politically cohesive”? In the Louisiana case, the district court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to draw a second majority-minority district.

Republicans then drew a 250-mile majority-minority district that snakes from the state’s northwest to Baton Rouge. The district isn’t compact and is barely contiguous. Non-black voters then challenged the new map as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A lower court agreed, saying the second district violated Gingles.

In the Court’s recent Allen v. Milligan decision (2023), Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals in requiring a second majority-minority district in Alabama because the minority population was compact. The other four Justices wrote in dissent that the majority misapplied Gingles and contended that courts should “apply a race-neutral benchmark” in deciding whether maps violate Section 2.

Yet Justice Kavanaugh emphasized in a concurring opinion that “the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” This echoed the Court’s SFFA v. Harvard decision striking down racial preferences in college admissions. Map-making now may be the only field in which government sorting by race remains legal.

The Court began to slide shut the door to racial gerrymandering in its landmark Shelby County (2013) decision, which struck down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 4 pre-clearance formula. The Court held that the formula was an anachronism from the Jim Crow era and didn’t account for racial progress. The same is true of the Gingles interpretation of Section 2.

As Louisiana argues, “race-based redistricting rests on an invidious stereotype: that all minorities, by virtue of their membership in their racial class, think alike and share the same interests and voting preferences.”

Justice Clarence Thomas has been making this argument for years in eloquent dissents, and he wrote last term that the Court’s “Janus-like election-law jurisprudence” has created an “intractable conflict between this Court’s interpretation” of Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause. The result is that “states do not know how to draw maps that ‘survive both constitutional and VRA review.’”

Consider Texas, which was sued by the Biden Justice Department for not drawing enough majority-minority districts. With that case pending in the courts, the Trump Justice Department threatened a legal challenge claiming several districts were “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” Texas Republicans this summer used the Trump threat as an excuse to redraw the districts to increase their partisan advantage. Now they are being sued again under Section 2.

The Justices would do the country and themselves a favor by correcting the Gingles error and declaring that the Constitution forbids race-based map-making. As the Chief wrote in a 2006 redistricting opinion, “it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.”

The Guardian says the relief is real, but will Palestinian suffering end?

The reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, the release of the living hostages has led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due to uncertainty about who is being freed and where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return to dig through rubble for the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.

As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefire appeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined a high-powered peace summit of more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination in Mr Trump’s plan gives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.

The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidents Obama and Biden. This despite the Biden administration a year ago having attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.

A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.

Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid – and food and medicines must be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, with Sir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.

Strong international support for the Palestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump's crackdowns on student visas

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

So declared Donald Trump in 2015, kicking off a presidential campaign rooted in hatred, fear and xenophobic myth — though at least tempered by the “good people” afterthought.

But 10 years later, it turns out “good people” from around the world aren’t welcomed in Trump’s America, either. Even foreign college students here legally and on their own dime to study in America’s great universities — the very definition of the “best of the best” — are getting the signal loud and clear that this president doesn’t want them here.

In St. Louis, as around the nation, colleges and universities have seen their enrollment of foreign students here on student visas plummet this year. Some of it’s due to stricter student visa requirements the administration is imposing for no good reason. Others are choosing not to come here out of concern about whether they will be allowed to stay and work after graduation — a concern exacerbated by the administration’s new $100,000 H-1B work visa fee on American employers who want to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.

Still others, presumably, are repelled by the toxic and increasingly brazen anti-immigrant rhetoric from the MAGA movement and its expanding campaign to rid America of anyone not born here.

That campaign is especially self-destructive when it comes to supporting American higher education. Unlike most American-born college students, foreign students who study here generally are paying top tuition rates, a financial lifeline for institutions that have struggled with diminishing public funding and declining enrollment by American-born students.

As the Post-Dispatch’s Monica Obradovic reports, a survey of four St. Louis-area universities found a drop in international enrollment of more than 2,700 students this year compared to last. St. Louis University alone has dropped by more than 1,500 international students. Washington University in St. Louis is down almost 1,000 foreign students. Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville is down 15%.

It’s part of a national trend that has dire implications for America’s economy. The NAFSA Association of International Educators estimates that foreign students contribute close to $44 billion to the economy annually, including supporting more than 378,000 jobs here. The New York Times reported this month that nearly 20% fewer international students arrived in the U.S. for the start of the current school year in August compared to last year. That’s the largest one-year drop on record except for the 2020 pandemic year.

Some of the administration’s student visa revocations have been in response to foreign students engaging in peaceful protest against U.S. policy regarding Gaza and other controversies. That’s a shameful statement to the world about how little our current president values our own First Amendment.

But most of the decline in international students is due to stricter student visa restrictions, travel bans from specific countries — and students simply (and understandably) declining to come here because of the current xenophobic political climate fueled by this administration. A spokesperson for Webster University in St. Louis County, for example, told the Post-Dispatch’s Obradovic that the private school has seen international enrollment fall at its three domestic campuses in favor of its seven foreign campuses.

The issue is bigger than money. International students tend to be the best and the brightest from their countries. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that fully one in four billion-dollar American startups have founders or co-founders who initially came here as international students. George Mason University reported in 2024 that almost one-third of Nobel laureates affiliated with American academic institutions were born somewhere else.

In terms of both economic and intellectual benefit to the U.S., these are exactly the “good people” Trump alluded to a decade ago. Yet under his current regime, they’re being expelled, barred or just convinced to stay away in record numbers. We’re all the poorer for it.

Ripple effects on US economy As other countries and regulators are working to mitigate climate risk, the administration has criticised climate change, with Trump calling it a “con job”.
“Climate change is a tremendous stress on the economy,” she said.
Atkins’ comments ignore increasing calls for climate change impacts to be incorporated into financial statements which ultimately harms investors who aren’t aware of the risks coming from climate change, Martin said.
There is increasing evidence that climate change is already having devastating impacts on the US economy.","The US administration’s pushback on climate issues and firing of climate experts under President Donald Trump has given investors mixed signals and could impact the broader economy due to a lack of data and regulatory insight, experts have told Green Central Banking.

“It’s easier to make an ideologically driven decision, to ignore the problem as it’s growing and manifesting, if you don’t have the expertise in the room,” said Alex Martin, policy director of climate finance at Americans for Financial Reform.

Under Trump’s leadership, federal regulators have either limited or paused initiatives around climate change. Most recently, the US Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) disbanded two committees focused on the impact that climate change could have on the economy and financial stability, which advocates worry could leave regulators without key information for managing risks.

The FSOC has previously recognised the systematic threat of climate change and “choosing to ignore these risks isn’t just petty political posturing; it makes the financial system more fragile by weakening regulators’ ability to monitor and respond to cross-cutting threats that endanger Americans’ financial security,” said Jessye Waxman, campaign advisor at Sierra Club.

Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused its climate disclosure rules that would have required publicly traded companies to report their emissions data and has refused to defend its position in court.

Other jurisdictions, including in California and the EU, already require climate disclosure data or will do so soon. In California, for example, nearly 70% of companies that fall under requirements to report supply chain emissions data are headquartered outside the state.

Ripple effects on US economy

As other countries and regulators are working to mitigate climate risk, the administration has criticised climate change, with Trump calling it a “con job”. California’s disclosure rules are being challenged in court, while SEC chairman Paul Atkins recently threatened to ban European accounting rules from the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) if the agency continues to pursue sustainability and climate issues.

European companies are allowed to use standards from the IFRS in lieu of the US’s Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. While the IFRS has established climate standards under the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), these are separate from its accounting standards and one does not impose requirements on the other, an IFRS foundation spokesperson said.

These actions could have ripple effects across the US economy, said Allison Fajans-Turner, policy lead at the Rainforest Action Network, especially as the Trump administration has rolled back the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Climate change is a tremendous stress on the economy,” she said. Not only from physical impacts, but also from rising energy costs. Trump’s attack on clean energy is ultimately going to hit people’s bottom line and fall on the taxpayer as other countries increase their clean energy manufacturing, Fajans-Turner said.

“The US is ceding clean energy manufacturing to other countries. And this administration said they wanted to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. The actions that they’re taking are actually doing the opposite of that. Clean energy was one of the fastest growing sources of jobs, and by starving it of support and resources they’re actually squashing down that job market”.

Mixed signals for banks and investors

Moves such as the FSOC disbandment of climate groups is part of a general trend by the US government to sideline and dismiss experts, said Martin.

Both Trump and his administration have made claims about authoritative institutions and individuals without providing evidence to back them up. Claims by the SEC’s Atkins that the ISSB prevents the IFRS from setting reliable, independent account standards is no different.

“It’s almost like climate denial in a way,” said Martin.

Atkins’ comments ignore increasing calls for climate change impacts to be incorporated into financial statements which ultimately harms investors who aren’t aware of the risks coming from climate change, Martin said.

This has led to less interest in green projects such as renewable energy in the US even as the rest of the world has increased investment by 10%. Businesses are receiving mixed signals on how to comply with jurisdictions and become more sustainable without drawing the ire of the Trump administration which has shown it is “willing to attack businesses [and] individuals, for not participating in [the administration’s] denials of these realities around climate change,” Martin said.

US banks have responded to Trump’s anti-green stance by withdrawing from volunteer climate commitment groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which has subsequently closed down. In addition, some companies have continued their green transition efforts without publicly talking about it, a phenomenon known as greenhushing.

Investors and companies in general want to make the highest return with the lowest risk possible, and investors are increasingly looking beyond the next quarter to the next 50 years, said Steven Rothstein, chief programme officer at climate thinktank Ceres.

“There are many banks and investors that are stepping away from public statements. They are doing the work, but they’re not talking about it,” he said.

There is increasing evidence that climate change is already having devastating impacts on the US economy. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that the effect of extreme weather events has increased drastically since the 1980s. Meanwhile, a report from Ceres found that there is more risk on bank balance sheets from physical and transition risk of climate change than there was from the subprime housing crisis.

“Fundamentally, Mother Nature doesn’t know who’s elected president, and the fires and floods continue,” Rothstein said.",https://greencentralbanking.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/US-retreat-from-climate-regulation-could-put-economy-under-stress-experts-say-meta-image.png,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:31.774997

EIG’s Renewable & Energy Transition Moves Even while he warns of risk, EIG is active in the clean energy space.
Fidra Energy: EIG launched this UK/EU battery storage platform.
European Energy & EIG: The two raised €130 million for green energy construction, especially wind and solar, in Europe.
Prosolia Energy: EIG agreed to a €255 million deal to support Prosolia in growing its solar power business across Europe.","Blair Thomas, chairman and CEO of EIG Partners, has made a strong warning about investing in renewable energy today. He said, “I think US renewables are largely un-investable today because of the policy framework.” He went on: “Another I would point to is the UK North Sea. It’s largely uninvestable because of policy decisions by the UK government.”

Why He Says Renewables Face a Risky Future

Thomas’s view is that even though the technology for wind, solar, and battery storage is more advanced than ever, the rules set by governments are too unstable. Investors need certainty. If rules change mid-project, costs rise and profits shrink.

He pointed to two regions:

The United States – where shifting tax incentives, regulation delays, and political opposition make projects risky.

The UK North Sea – where licensing, taxes, and government choices have pushed investors away.

EIG’s Renewable & Energy Transition Moves

Even while he warns of risk, EIG is active in the clean energy space. Their work shows they still see opportunity — but only where policy is stable.

According to EIG’s public reports, the firm has committed over $6.5 billion to energy transition investments globally, including renewable, hydrogen, and battery projects as of 2024.

Here are a few examples of what EIG is doing now:

Aukera: EIG helped arrange a €450 million facility for Aukera to build more than 1.5 GW of solar, wind, and co-located battery projects in Europe by 2026.

Fidra Energy: EIG launched this UK/EU battery storage platform. It plans a 10 GW battery portfolio by 2030, including a major 1.45 GW site in South Yorkshire.

Fidra and Sungrow: They signed a partnership to deploy 4.4 GWh of storage systems in the UK, supporting big battery projects.

Modern Energy & Industrial Sun: EIG invested $90 million to boost large-scale solar plants in the U.S. (Texas region) for industrial clients.

European Energy & EIG: The two raised €130 million for green energy construction, especially wind and solar, in Europe.

Prosolia Energy: EIG agreed to a €255 million deal to support Prosolia in growing its solar power business across Europe.

Policy Instability: The Main Blocker

Thomas’s critique is clear: policy risk is the greatest barrier. Even good technology and strong capital don’t help if rules shift. Investors may lose confidence, and money moves away.

Some key facts:

Energy transition investments are complex and long term; investors often lock money in for 10–20 years.

Governments may change tax incentives, or remove subsidies, or revise rules for licensing and permits.

Projects need stable grid and transmission access. Delays or grid constraints reduce project value.

What Makes a Market “Investable”?

Thomas and many in the field say a market is investable when:

Rules are stable for many years

Permits are predictable and fast

Financing and capital are assured over the project life

Grid access is reliable and cost-effective

Challenges Are Global, Not Just in the U.S.

Thomas did not limit his view to the U.S. He also warned about the UK North Sea, where policy changes, taxation rules, and licenses have driven away investors.

Globally, many countries face similar tension: they want renewable growth, yet they fear locking in bad deals or excessive subsidies. So they hesitate, or keep changing course. That uncertainty scares away big investors.

How EIG’s Own Data Supports His Warning

EIG’s public data supports Thomas’s skepticism about wide investment in renewables. The firm has steadily increased its focus on energy transition. But still, only a portion of its capital goes into clean energy.

Metric Value Total capital committed over lifetime Over $51.3 billion in energy projects worldwide Latest AUM (Assets Under Management) ≈ $23.8 billion as of June 30, 2025 Investment in energy transition (by 2024) $6.5 billion

What Must Change for Renewables to Grow

To make renewable energy truly investable, several reforms are needed. Thomas and analysts broadly agree on these steps:

Long-term policy commitments—plans that last 10–20 years without sudden swings.

Faster permitting processes—clearer steps and faster approvals for projects.

Better grid and transmission build-out—more electricity lines to carry solar and wind power.

Stable tax credits or subsidies—support that does not change midstream.

Public-private partnerships—governments and private firms sharing risk and reward.

Without such changes, Thomas believes many renewable projects will stall. Investment will slow. And that could hamper progress toward climate goals.

Conclusion

Blair Thomas’s strong warning shakes up how we think about clean energy investments. He makes us see that advanced technology alone is not enough.

MISSION, Texas — At a press conference hosted by the Texas International Produce Association (TIPA) on Friday, October 10, 2025, regional leaders, business officials, and lawmakers called for immediate action to address what they described as a mounting crisis of water scarcity in the Rio Grande Valley. The group urged the U.S. government to make Mexico’s compliance with the 1944 Water Treaty enforceable through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The event, held at the TexaSweet Building in Mission, gathered key figures including U.S. Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz, Texas Citrus Mutual President Dale Murden, Elsa Economic Development Corporation Executive Director Daniel Rivera, and Texas International Produce Association President and CEO Dante Galeazzi. Together, they outlined how Mexico’s failure to deliver water as required by treaty obligations has left millions of people, thousands of farmers, and the region’s ecosystem in jeopardy.

“For far too long—80 years—we have been held hostage by the Mexican government, which failed over and over to give us the water that they owed us,” said Congresswoman De La Cruz. “That’s why we lost our sugar cane industry—over 500 jobs and millions of dollars gone. That will not happen under my watch.”

De La Cruz, who represents South Texas in Congress, said her office has worked closely with federal agencies to push Mexico to fulfill its obligations. She noted that over the past year, Mexico has begun delivering overdue water and is expected to provide 420,000 acre-feet by the end of this month. “This is huge,” she said, “but our work does not end there. We need to put teeth on the 1944 Water Treaty.”

According to De La Cruz, the best path forward is to link the treaty to USMCA, the trilateral trade agreement governing commerce among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. “Currently, under the 1944 Water Treaty, there are no consequences to the Mexican government if they fail to deliver,” she said. “By tying it to the USMCA, we create consequences—real, enforceable measures if they do not comply.”

Dale Murden, who represents more than 400 citrus growers as president of Texas Citrus Mutual, emphasized that the issue extends far beyond agriculture. “Availability affects this region in every way,” Murden said. “Regional growth, the economy, the environment, agriculture, sustainability, and our community’s health all depend on water. The Rio Grande is our lifeline.”

Murden noted that over six million people rely on the river for drinking, sanitation, and public use. He added that repeated shortfalls by Mexico have left Valley cities “scrambling for emergency measures during droughts,” making long-term planning nearly impossible. “Reduced flows lead to dying wetlands, rising salinity, and loss of fish and wildlife habitat,” he said. “Protecting the river’s flow is protecting the Valley’s health, welfare, and future.”

From an economic standpoint, Daniel Rivera of the Elsa Economic Development Corporation described how water shortages are already affecting communities and budgets. “In Elsa, we’re already paying almost three times as much for our water as we were a couple of years ago,” Rivera said. “That strains families and our city operations.”

Rivera said that without reliable water, growth slows, developers hesitate to invest, and confidence in the region’s economic future weakens. “Water is a foundation for every home we build, every business park we design, and every factory we hope to land,” he said. “The 1944 Water Treaty isn’t just an environmental agreement—it’s a trade issue. Water drives production, labor, and infrastructure—the very sectors USMCA was designed to strengthen.”

The agricultural toll has been severe. Dante Galeazzi, president and CEO of the Texas International Produce Association, said farmers have been forced to plant fewer crops for several consecutive years due to water scarcity. “More than 90 percent of our freshwater comes from the Rio Grande,” he said. “If there’s no water in that river, where are we going to get it?”

Galeazzi said farmers planted 30 percent fewer fruits and vegetables this past season—not by choice but by necessity. “It’s the third year in a row they’ve had to tell customers, ‘I’m sorry, I have nothing for you,’” he said. “It’s the third year they’ve had to tell their banks they’ll be short on payments. Some are asking themselves if it’s time to stop farming altogether. That’s not right. That’s not how it should be.”

All four speakers urged the public to participate in the U.S. Trade Representative’s open comment period before November 3, 2025, to support including the 1944 Water Treaty in the USMCA. Comments can be submitted through https://comments.ustr.gov/s/submit-new-comment?docketNumber=USTR-2025-0004

De La Cruz said public pressure is essential to show Washington the Valley’s unity and urgency. “We need the public to step in and make comments,” she said. “This is the time when the Rio Grande Valley can step up into the national light and really highlight the need for this treaty to be in the USMCA agreement.”

When asked what might happen if the effort fails, De La Cruz responded firmly, “I don’t know anything but success. There is no other option but to win here.”

Murden closed the event by reiterating the call for collective action. “We want to encourage public participation in the USTR comment process and highlight the importance of uniting the Valley’s voice on water security and environmental protection,” he said. “No water, no growth, no life. It’s that simple.”

At the conclusion of the event, attendees were provided with informational packets containing background materials and a QR code. The QR code takes readers directly to the U.S. Trade Representative’s comment portal, enabling the public to quickly participate in the feedback process and lend their voice to the campaign for water security in the Rio Grande Valley.

Dive Brief:

Harris County, Texas, sued the Environmental Protection Agency Monday for canceling its Solar for All grant funding. Harris County received one of the largest Solar for All Awards in 2024.

The EPA eliminated the program in August, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but the lawsuit states “the OBBBA provides no authority for EPA’s Elimination Decision.”

“The Trump administration is breaking the law to score political points, and Harris County residents shouldn’t have to pay that price,” Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement posted on social media. “Congress appropriated this funding, EPA awarded it to Harris County after a rigorous competitive process.”

Dive Insight:

The Texas Solar for All Coalition was awarded nearly $250 million in 2024 to expand solar access across the state as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Harris County — the state’s largest county and home to Houston — led the coalition and secured more than $54 million.

On August 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency would no longer implement the $7 billion Solar for All program, saying the OBBBA “repealed EPA’s authority to administer the program and rescinded all remaining funds.”

Zeldin said very little of the money had been spent and recipients were “still very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process.”

On Sept. 2, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit supported the EPA’s termination of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants, stating the Biden administration modified the grant agreements “to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.”

Harris County’s lawsuit asserts the OBBBA rescinds only $19 million in unobligated administrative costs, not the grant funds that were obligated by the IRA’s Sept. 30, 2024, deadline.

Rescinding the funding causes “irreparable harm to Harris County and its constituents,” the lawsuit states. “Harris County personnel and Texas Coalition staff have dedicated countless hours to setting up operations for Solar for All and working to deliver the program’s benefits to their constituents,” the plaintiffs state.

Chinese EV makers, bolstered by significant government subsidies, have built a big advantage in manufacturing capacity, speed of design, supply-chain networks and, especially, price.","When the federal government’s electric-vehicle tax credits expired on Sept. 30, Hyundai made its move. The Korean automaker knocked as much as $10,000 off the price of its EVs in the U.S., more than making up for the taxpayer-funded $7,500 credit the GOP canceled years ahead of schedule in its “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

So, were Hyundai and the rest gouging Americans all along, using the tax incentive to greedily jack up profits? Doesn’t look that way: Market leader Tesla makes a decent profit, but for most other automakers, gas-powered vehicles have been much more profitable than their battery-operated counterparts. The credits were always meant to be temporary, and they’ve run their course. Whether Americans actually want electric vehicles is a question politicians can’t answer — only the market can.

Automakers should now prove they can stand on their own. Yet the outlook is fraught because of one big problem: China.

American automakers are losing a fight for the future against competitors bankrolled by the Chinese government. Stepping back and letting it happen stands to reduce economic growth, especially in the auto-dependent Midwest, and put America’s national security at risk as well.

So far, America’s response to the stiff competition is to bar Chinese vehicles altogether. President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, opposites in so many ways, agreed that opening the U.S. market to Chinese EV imports would hurt Detroit. Both administrations imposed enormous tariffs that keep out the competing vehicles.

As a temporary measure giving U.S. automakers an opportunity to play catch-up, the tariffs are understandable. But permanent protectionism is poison for innovation. Those trade barriers hurt American consumers who otherwise could be saving a fortune on their next vehicle purchase. And history shows that trade barriers can’t be sustained forever. America must gear up to beat its Chinese competitors mano a mano — and that’s not happening.

U.S. automakers just booked an excellent quarter for EV sales, as car buyers responded to the end of credits by accelerating purchases. Next quarter’s EV sales are expected to flatline, as they did when Germany eliminated a similar tax subsidy.

Into this sluggish sales environment, automakers will need to unload tens of thousands of EVs they have already manufactured. Some, like Hyundai, have decided to keep sales going by piling money on the hoods. Others will provide less direct incentives, while hoping their new EV and battery plants don’t go completely idle during the widely expected downturn ahead.

When its credits expired, Germany was much further along in adopting EVs than the U.S. Princeton University’s Zero Lab predicts that battery-powered EV sales in the U.S. will be about 40% lower as of 2030 without the credits than if the GOP had elected to continue them.

The Trump administration appears content to keep trade barriers in place and encourage Detroit to make gas-powered SUVs and pickup trucks for as long as possible. In that scenario, America’s expensive EVs are destined to be niche players at home and abroad. There’s also the question of whether Americans want — or can afford — electric vehicles.

If that’s the extent of the policy, the world will move on, and Detroit will be left in the dust. EV sales this year are expected to exceed 20 million vehicles, and China will make two-thirds of them, including millions for export. Anyone who thinks EVs are going away isn’t paying attention to the global market, especially emerging markets where, absent trade barriers, affordable Chinese models dominate.

Most Americans don’t recognize company names like BYD, Geely and Great Wall, but you’d better believe the Big Three know them. Ford’s Jim Farley has called China’s progress on EVs “the most humbling thing I have ever seen,” and said it poses a “colossal” threat to Ford’s future.

Chinese EV makers, bolstered by significant government subsidies, have built a big advantage in manufacturing capacity, speed of design, supply-chain networks and, especially, price. While all EVs are cheap to operate over their lifetimes – no gas required, few moving parts to repair — China is making high-quality vehicles at astonishingly low sticker prices. American automakers can’t come close.

America’s auto industry is an important strategic asset. It needs to be a world beater again, and that won’t happen unless it can meet the competition head-on.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/OPED-USCHINA-AUTOMAKERS-EDITORIAL-SD-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:03:54.305510

In partnership with Kia America and UC Irvine, Wallbox demonstrates vehicle-to-home tech as the Spain-based brand preps wider U.S. rollout

In a California neighborhood built for an all-electric future, six homes are quietly running on power pulled not from the grid—but from the car in the driveway.

Wallbox has completed the first U.S. residential installations of its Quasar 2 bidirectional EV charger, a system that allows drivers to both charge their electric vehicles and discharge that stored energy back into their homes. The milestone, achieved through a collaboration with Kia America and the University of California, Irvine (UCI), showcases how electric vehicles can double as backup power sources and energy management tools.

The first six Quasar 2 units were deployed in Menifee, California, where homeowners can now power essential loads directly from their Kia EV9s, effectively turning their vehicles into mobile batteries.

“This is more than a technology milestone. It is a glimpse of a future where every EV is an energy asset,” said Douglas Alfaro, Chief Business Development Officer at Wallbox. “Quasar 2 puts homeowners in control of their energy, helping them achieve resilience, independence, and sustainability in their daily lives.”

EVs as home batteries

The Quasar 2 enables vehicle-to-home (V2H) power flow—letting compatible EVs send electricity back into the house during outages or periods of high utility rates. When paired with Wallbox’s Power Recovery Unit, the system can supply up to three days of backup power, based on an average home’s daily consumption. Wallbox and Kia formed their partnership back in 2023.

“As we continue to expand our lineup of electric vehicles, projects like this help us showcase how EVs can deliver value beyond mobility,” said Sujith Somasekharan, Director of Connected Car & Mobility at Kia America. “Partnering with Wallbox and UCI allows us to show how our vehicles can power homes, reduce costs, and create meaningful environmental impact for families.”

The Wallbox Quasar 2 charger delivers up to 12 kW of power for both charging and discharging and can also integrate with solar systems through the company’s Power Meter for Energy Management Solutions, allowing customers to recharge their EVs directly from on-site solar generation.

A living lab for grid-smart neighborhoods

The demonstration is part of a broader pilot led by UCI’s Advanced Power and Energy Program (APEP), which studies how electric vehicles, smart homes, and distributed energy systems can coordinate to enhance grid stability.

“Real-world deployment of bidirectional charging is essential for gathering the data and technical insights needed to scale V2H deployment across the grid,” said Professor Scott Samuelsen, APEP’s founding director.

By operating in a residential setting, the Menifee project gives researchers a direct look at how homeowners interact with V2H systems—how often they use backup power, how it impacts energy costs, and how EVs can be managed as grid resources.

The word on Wallbox

Wallbox says broader U.S. availability for the Quasar 2 is next. Back in March, the Wallbox team announced pre-ordering availability for the Quasar 2 and Power Recovery Unit initially limited to California, Texas, Florida, New York, Washington, New Jersey, or Illinois, with a nationwide rollout to follow.

Founded in 2015, Wallbox has become one of the most active innovators in EV charging and energy management, offering solutions across more than 100 countries. Its growing partnership with Generac Power Systems—which made a minority investment in the company in 2023—will expand distribution of Wallbox products through Generac’s dealer network and integrate bidirectional EV charging into its broader home energy ecosystem.

The ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s , which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

Reliance on Public Charging

According to data from fast-charging provider EVgo Inc., experienced electric vehicle owners typically charge at home, while newer adopters rely more on public charging. These habits opened opportunities for businesses to expand their charging infrastructure.

The Times reported that retail and restaurant chains — including Cracker Barrel, Dunkin’, Target, Wawa, and Ikea — each added four to 14 charging stations. Additionally, Pilot Travel Centers activated 27 stations during the latest quarter.

EV Credits Gone

Reports of the expansion came nearly two weeks after federal electric vehicle tax credits ended. The incentives, valued at up to $4,000 for used vehicles and $7,500 for new ones, ended Sept. 30 following the passage of a Republican tax and spending package last July.

However, funding for charging is expected to continue after a federal court ordered President Donald Trump’s administration to restore billions in previously frozen funds in June.

Future of EV Sales

Still, Ford CEO Jim Farley recently warned that electric vehicle sales could fall to 5% without federal incentives, describing the market as “way smaller than we thought.”

Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.
As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity.
“Everybody’s able to share.” Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities.","For years, Western leaders have debated the creation of a regional energy market: a coordinated grid to pool solar power in Arizona, wind in Wyoming, hydro in Washington and battery storage in California.

The shared resources would meet the demands of 11 different states, bolstering utilities’ local power plants with surplus energy from across the region.

With the passage of a landmark new law in California, that market is finally on its way to becoming a reality. Proponents say it has the potential to lower energy costs, make the grid more resilient and speed up the deployment of clean energy.

But the market’s success, experts agree, depends heavily on which states and utilities decide to opt in. As energy issues have become increasingly politicized, it’s uncertain whether Western leaders can buy into a common vision for meeting the region’s power needs.

“As we move toward weather-dependent renewables to run our grid, we’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern,” said California Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation aimed at establishing the new market. “A Western energy market is critical.”

The California measure earned bipartisan support, and leaders in conservative and liberal states alike have long touted the benefits of a region-wide market.

But some skeptics worry about merging the power systems of states with varying climate goals. And some fear the new market could give federal regulators appointed by President Donald Trump an opening to interfere and mandate more fossil fuel-powered plants that can be turned on regardless of the weather.

A bigger market

Across the 11 Western states that straddle or sit west of the Rocky Mountains, 37 separate private and public utilities operate portions of the grid.

This fragmented structure differs from the grid systems in Eastern and Midwestern states, where regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, coordinate and plan for energy needs across vast swaths of the country.

Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.

Under the current system, each utility is required by state public utility commissions to build enough power to meet peak energy demands. That could mean building gas plants that only turn on a few times a year during extreme heat waves.

As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity. Such agreements could also prevent the periodic shutdowns of wind and solar farms when they produce more energy than local utilities can use.

“We could be drawing on the solar resources from the Southwest during the day, and then in the evening the wind resources in Montana and Wyoming are a great benefit,” said Austin Scharff, senior energy policy specialist with the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We have a lot of hydro resources, and we can help make sure the regional grid stays balanced when those are needed.”

Some industry leaders say such trading would allow states to pull in cheap electricity from elsewhere, rather than building expensive new power plants.

“When you have this bigger market, not everybody has to build to their peak in the same way,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “Everybody’s able to share.”

Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities. Utilities spanning much of the West also transact through a real-time market that allows them to address pressing short-term demand issues. Some are poised to join a new day-ahead market that will conduct planning based on daily demand and production forecasts.

But some lawmakers and officials believe the region needs a larger vision that goes beyond moment-by-moment needs, a market that can plan interstate transmission lines and energy projects to serve the whole region in the decades to come.

“We’re facing really rapidly growing energy demand,” said Nevada Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “The best way for us to meet that is to effectively move energy all across the Western U.S. The only way we can do that is through an RTO.”

Watts sponsored a bill, enacted in 2021, that requires Nevada to join an RTO by 2030. Colorado also passed a law that year with a 2030 deadline for utilities to join an RTO.

“Any future is better than our status quo, which is 37 separate grids in the West,” said Chris Hansen, a former Democratic senator who sponsored the Colorado legislation. “We can lower costs and provide greater reliability if we’re sharing resources.”

Hansen now serves as CEO of La Plata Electric Association, an electric cooperative in southwestern Colorado.

A new market

The push for a West-wide market had always faced one major hurdle: Any market would likely include the massive geographical footprint and energy supply managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. As the West’s largest grid operator, CAISO manages the flow of electricity across most of the Golden State. It’s governed by a five-member board appointed by California’s governor, and other states were unlikely to sign up for a market in which they have no representation.

The law passed by California legislators last month allows for a new organization with independent governance from across the region to oversee Western energy markets.

“This legislation is a key reset and has been the largest sticking point in building a regional market,” said Amanda Ormond, managing director of the Western Grid Group, which advocates for a more efficient grid. “This is a primary concern of a lot of folks that has now been solved.”

The law sets in motion a yearslong process that will task regional leaders with establishing the organization’s governance and navigating a series of regulatory procedures. The new market could be in place by 2028.

State leaders across the West say the California law is a long-awaited development.

“You get this really good benefit from being able to optimize across a larger footprint than an individual utility can,” said Tim Kowalchik, research director with the Utah Office of Energy Development. “Those resources can play really well together.”

Utah led a study in 2021, collaborating with other Western states, exploring the potential for energy markets in the region. State officials say the research has helped drive the current effort.

“It was fascinating how substantial the benefits were,” said Letha Tawney, chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. “The interdependence of the West started to become much more apparent, and it really changed the conversation.”

The study looked at a variety of market options and found that an RTO would have significant benefits, lowering costs for electricity customers and promoting clean energy. Based on the study’s projections, the market would produce roughly $2 billion in gross benefits per year, largely by saving utilities from building extra capacity.

Another study in 2022, conducted by a pair of consulting firms, found that an RTO would create as many as 657,000 permanent jobs and bolster the region’s economy.

While Western leaders say the potential benefits are massive, no states outside of Nevada and Colorado have committed to joining a regional RTO. State leaders say they’ll be watching carefully to see what emerges from the new California law. While the decision on joining the market will largely be left to individual utilities, state regulators can play a major role by directing them to conduct an economic analysis of such a move.

State sovereignty

The push for a regional market has also faced opposition from skeptics who fear it undermines states’ power to set their own energy and climate goals. Some point to Eastern governors’ frustration with PJM Interconnection, the RTO that manages the grid across a swath of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

“It’s very dangerous,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a California-based nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re giving up control of our sovereignty. Once a state’s in, it’s not the state that has the control.”

Some experts fear that states with significant coal or gas industries may be hesitant to join a market that could incentivize their utilities to import cheap solar power from elsewhere. On the flip side, some climate advocates in California are wary of plugging into a market that could support coal power from out of state.

“Some states are parochial-minded: ‘This is a California thing, and we don’t want anything to do with California,’” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit climate-focused group. “That one state’s government will not decide how a market will be operated, it’s a seismic shift in the industry.”

Backers of an RTO argue that it can incorporate states’ varying energy goals. They point to research showing that the market will support renewable power. But others fear merging fates with coal-heavy states could give federal regulators more leverage to intervene in favor of fossil-fuel power.

Even if Trump is out of office when the market comes online, the regulators he appoints to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will still be serving out their terms. Some believe FERC could set rules that require the new market to favor fossil fuel-powered resources.

“When you have a mixed market with a lot of coal plants, it creates opportunities for the Trump administration to rejigger the rules to favor coal,” said Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a California-based consumer advocacy group. “In another reality, this would have sounded like a hysterical concern, but it’s pretty obvious where [Trump’s appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] want to go.”

Freedman’s group pushed California lawmakers for protections that would have given states more flexibility to withdraw from the market, while also prohibiting “resource adequacy” mandates that could be used by the feds to prop up coal. While those elements were included in a Senate version of the bill, they were stripped from the Assembly bill that ultimately was passed.

Supporters of the bill say such concerns are overblown, and the new market is structured to avoid the pitfalls facing other RTOs.

“The simple economic fact is that right now clean energy resources are the cheapest in the world,” said Petrie-Norris, the law’s sponsor. “We’re going to see solar displacing dirty fuels rather than the reverse.”

Much depends on convincing states and utilities it’s in their best interests to join the market. The strength-in-numbers advantages of an RTO depend on widespread participation. While many Western leaders have long touted a region-wide market, the opportunity is arising at a time where energy has become a partisan issue.

Meanwhile, the long-awaited market emerging from California is facing new competition from the east. The Southwest Power Pool, an Arkansas-based RTO serving the middle of the country, is expanding its footprint in the West, with several utilities poised to join its day-ahead market.

“Anytime you have two neighboring utilities in different markets, you have seams that create a lot of friction and inefficiency,” said Rubin Shen, with the energy industry group. “Whether or not everybody can come together and be all-in on a full West-wide market, it’s too soon to tell.”

GM stock fell 3% in premarket trading to $53.96, even as the S&P 500 (SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also dipped, by 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively.

In its statement, GM attributed much of the slowdown to changes in U.S. government policy. “Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the company said.

This shift means the massive battery plants and production lines GM built over the past several years will take longer to reach full capacity. The company’s “Factory ZERO” facility in Detroit, once a symbol of the EV future, now faces a slower ramp-up as consumer demand softens.

Accounting Rules Force Harsh Reality Check

The $1.6 billion charge reflects an accounting process that measures whether the value of assets can still be justified by future cash flow. Accounting expert Robert Willens explained, “For long-lived assets, you compare the net carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to produce over their useful lives. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized.”

In other words, GM’s EV investments no longer appear capable of generating the returns once projected when federal incentives and stricter environmental rules were in place.

The impairment showcases the tension between government policy and corporate strategy. After years of aggressive investment in EV capacity, the rollback of key incentives has left automakers like GM caught between sunk costs and shifting demand dynamics.

GM Still Grows EV Sales Despite Challenges

Despite the write-down, GM’s EV sales continue to rise. The company delivered 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter, a 110% year-over-year increase and its best quarter to date. EVs now make up about 9.4% of its total U.S. vehicle sales.

The company said part of the surge reflected buyers rushing to take advantage of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit before it expired at the end of September. That short-term boost, however, may not translate into sustained growth as the incentive phaseout takes effect.

GM emphasized that the charge does not signal an abandonment of its EV goals but rather a recalibration of production schedules to align with market conditions.

Investors Sell GM Stock as Policy Friction Mounts

The sell-off in GM stock reflects investor concerns that the company’s massive EV buildout could take longer to pay off. While GM’s traditional gasoline vehicle lineup continues to drive profits, the EV division now represents a growing source of uncertainty.

Before the write-down, Wall Street analysts expected GM to generate about $11.4 billion in operating profit for 2025, down from nearly $15 billion in 2024. These forecasts may face further pressure if EV sales momentum fades.

Coming into Tuesday’s trading, GM shares were up about 4% year-to-date, with investors already wary of how import tariffs and policy reversals might weigh on margins. The latest charge confirms that the policy environment is now directly affecting automakers’ bottom lines.

EV Industry Confronts Political Reality

GM’s announcement adds to growing concern across the auto sector that the Trump administration’s policy shifts are impacting the EV industry. The removal of consumer tax credits and the easing of emissions standards have slowed adoption, while automakers are left with billions in EV investments that may take longer to pay off.

The broader message from GM’s charge is that the electric transition remains underway, but progress will likely be uneven as political and market forces collide. Moreover, the company’s $1.6 billion adjustment reflects a recalibration to new realities, not a retreat from its EV ambitions.

Is General Motors Stock a Good Buy?

Analyst sentiment toward General Motors (GM) remains cautiously optimistic even after the company’s $1.6 billion electric vehicle write-down. According to data from 18 Wall Street analysts over the past three months, GM holds a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating, with 13 analysts recommending a Buy, three suggesting a Hold, and two rating the stock a Sell.

The average 12-month GM price target sits at $65.89, implying an 18.46% upside from GM’s most recent closing price.

Alan Johnson spent more than 43 years working inside a chemical plant — a job that paid the bills, gave him purpose, and may have been slowly killing him all along.

Now 73, he lives about 15 miles outside Danville, Illinois, in a low-slung house with algae-streaked siding and a red barn out back. Inside, the rooms are dim and close. Model cars line the shelves. Pill bottles cluster on the table. Two dogs drift through the tight home — one calm, the other, Oreo, white-haired and rambunctious, eager to sit at Johnson’s feet.

It was raining the day we met. We’d planned to sit out front but instead settled in his living room, where a walker stood beside a worn recliner, and the window looked out onto wet grass. His hands shook and his voice wavered at times. The words came in fits and starts.

Parkinson’s, he said. Heart disease. Three kinds of dementia.

“You can’t hardly get a breath in there,” Johnson said, describing the air inside the chemical plant. He explained, “Even if you take a shower, you still got it on your skin.”

He spent decades working around vats of chemicals at the Danville factory now owned by Viscofan ($VIS.MC), the world’s largest producer of artificial meat casings. The plant emits carbon disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and other chemicals — all substances linked to neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular harm.

He remembers the burn pits behind the building — how they’d torch waste before dumping the rest under what’s now a maintenance shed. He remembers red-tinted runoff in the creek out back and dead fish. He remembers Environmental Protection Agency officials showing up in the middle of the night and giving his boss 20 minutes to shut down a leak — or they’d shut the whole place down themselves.

The problems, he said, never really stopped. “They don’t want to fix it. It costs money.”

His wife never worked a day at the plant, but died from a bad heart. To this day, Johnson thinks he brought toxic chemicals home on his skin.

And he’s not alone.

Hunterbrook Media talked to more than 40 Danville locals and former Viscofan workers — some of whom were granted anonymity out of fear of retaliation — to gather firsthand accounts of the experience of living next to one of Illinois’ most problematic polluters. Many told the same story: a workforce scarred with an unusual number of health problems, a sick town, and a company that never seemed to answer for any of it.

Some said employees were paid off in exchange for silence. Some residents only posted anonymously online. Others wouldn’t speak at all.

Still, the stories surface.

The roof caving overhead. Pennies turning green in one worker’s pockets. An employee being told to take a taxi, instead of an ambulance, to the hospital after coming into contact with acid. Lick Creek, where some locals recall swimming as children, carrying trails of dead fish. Locals call it “the smell.” It’s sharp, metallic — like cat pee and rotten eggs. Some say it causes headaches. Others don’t notice it anymore. It’s just part of living in Danville.

Before Viscofan, the plant had been owned by an American company, Teepak — and was, workers say, better run and safer.

“Teepak, they took care of their employees, they took care of us,” Johnson said. “This place? I don’t think they even give hams anymore for Christmas.”

Viscofan, a Spain-based multinational that touts Danville as its largest plant in the United States, took over the plant in 2006. Locals say that’s when things got worse. Enforcement didn’t improve, and protections weakened. And the illnesses? They kept coming.

Since then, the company has repeatedly violated environmental law through uncontrolled emissions, routine discharges into local waterways, and mishandling toxic waste on its property, according to public records obtained by Hunterbrook. For years, Viscofan defused pressure from the Illinois EPA by signing compliance commitment agreements — at least five since 2015.

But in June, that familiar escape route collapsed. In a sharply worded letter to Viscofan’s U.S. leadership obtained by Hunterbrook via a public records request, the Illinois EPA signaled its intent to pursue legal action, arguing that the company’s latest proposed settlement was insufficient given the “nature and seriousness” of the violations.

And now, as sickness spreads and more names fill the obituary pages, Danville’s residents are left asking: Why is this plant still here?

The Factory Town

Danville’s past reads like a tale of Midwestern industrial glory. A city powered by factories, the kind of place where stable, well-paying jobs were plentiful and manufacturing was booming. General Electric, Chuckles, Bunge, and Heatcraft were there, along with a Hyster forklift plant, and a large General Motors foundry that employed thousands.

But like so many factory towns in the Midwest, Danville watched its economy drain out in slow motion as plants closed and people left. Since 1970, Danville has lost at least six manufacturers and more than a third of its population.

What followed is still playing out. Today, Danville’s violent crime rate is nearly 1,700 per 100,000 people — among the highest in Illinois. The headlines barely scratch the surface: a man stabbed in an alley behind a neighborhood gas station and another slashed in the neck. Vacant homes — long abandoned — go up in flames, sometimes several in a single week, each blaze engulfing more than crumbling boards. The city is stretched thin, and trust in public systems is largely gone.

One side of town, where Danville High School is located, still bears the bones of what it was — the other side wears what it’s become. Viscofan straddles that intersection.

The factory was built in 1957 by Teepak, then a U.S.-based meat casing company that supplied major meat processors with cellulose and fibrous film. For decades, Teepak was seen as a reliable employer that treated workers well. In 2006, the company was purchased by Viscofan. Danville became its flagship U.S. facility; as of 2023, the plant employed nearly 300 people. And today, the site sits on more than 2.3 million square feet of land and operates around the clock, according to the company. The Danville facility is seemingly the only Viscofan plant in the U.S. producing cellulose casing fibrings. Its facility in Montgomery, Alabama, converts “cellulose, fibrous, and plastics,” and its Bridgewater, New Jersey, plant focuses on collagen casings, according to the company’s website.

Other manufacturers still operate in Danville — including Mervis, Hyster‑Yale, Thyssenkrupp, and Flex‑N‑Gate — but among the locals Hunterbrook spoke with, there was a near-unanimous view that Viscofan stands apart, and not in a good way.

“My mother worked for Bunge for years, and she never had issues with that place,” said Amanda Brady, a former Viscofan employee. “Hyster is just a place that ships parts — no fumes at all. Viscofan is the worst place I have ever worked. I didn’t mind the job itself, but the environment was horrible and was getting worse by the day.”

Where the plant is located tells its own story.

Viscofan backs up against some of the most distressed housing in Vermilion County. Fair Oaks, a nearly 200-unit public housing complex, sits a little over half a mile away. When a Hunterbrook reporter visited the complex in July, the neglect was evident — worn brick buildings with rusting window frames in need of repair.

Some of the homes in the streets just behind the plant echo the same pattern: overgrown lawns, dirty siding, personal belongings, even a refrigerator, catching dust on porches. Within a one-mile radius of Viscofan, 64% of residents are low-income, and around 25% of households earn under $15,000 a year.

A Hunterbrook analysis of property data shows that many of the cheapest homes in Danville cluster tightly around the Viscofan plant. Properties within half a mile sell for a median of just $47,500, and home values remain depressed out to nearly two miles.

Beyond that ring, values climb steeply. By three miles, the median home price has nearly doubled to $68,000, reaching about $90,000 by five miles. At the 10-mile mark, the median reaches $109,000 — more than twice as high as homes closest to the smokestacks.

The disparity holds even after adjusting for home size. Within two miles, the median home price is about $35 to $40 per square foot, compared to over $72 per square foot 10 miles out. Lot sizes also expand steadily: a median of 7,000 square feet near the plant, versus more than 11,000 square feet about 10 miles out.

In short, Viscofan’s footprint doesn’t just happen to sit amid low property values — it defines a gradient of cheaper and smaller housing radiating outward from the plant.

Still, some lash out at the critics. “Complaining about a smell, then complain when they close down, and folks are out of work as local industry further dive bombs,” one resident wrote in a comment on Facebook. “It’s not a perfect world.”

In Danville, that kind of tension is just another part of the landscape. Viscofan is still here — and that’s either the problem or the point.

Sick and Spreading

“If you made it out,” said Damian Street, a former Viscofan employee, “you were going to die in six months.”

Street worked at the plant for nearly seven years, first as a process technician. He’d grown up just blocks from the plant, back when it was still Teepak, and said his grandfather had retired from the quality lab there. But by the time he started in 2016, the stories he’d heard as a kid — about the air, the chemicals, the people getting sick — were no longer rumors. They were realities he was starting to see up close, every day.

“There’s been numerous people out there get cancer last few years, and I’m worried myself about it now,” he said. “I had a neighbor that used to work there. … He made it about a year before he died. It was so aggressive that there was nothing that could be done.”

The longer Street stayed, the more it felt like the place was eating people alive. He spoke of toxic salt dumped straight onto the ground, walls dissolving under acid leaks, metal beams crumbling to flakes in months. “I’ve seen this stuff eat like complete metal,” he said. “If it’s doing that to concrete and cinder blocks and I-beams, what do you think it’s doing to your actual body?”

Over time, his colleagues started to disappear.

“It’s like two or three people have died since I’ve left from out there that have gotten cancer and died,” he said. “The EPA comes out there — they [Viscofan] make it look pretty, they do what they got to do to get by, and then they go right back to square one.”

Street’s stories weren’t an outlier. In fact, they fit into a pattern Hunterbrook began to uncover after four months of interviews, records searches, and outreach.

Hunterbrook reached out to hundreds of former workers at Viscofan’s Danville plant. Dozens responded, and nearly 20 agreed to speak. Several said they were currently battling cancer, breathing issues, Parkinson’s disease, or another severe health condition, or had recently recovered. The others pointed to friends and coworkers who hadn’t been so lucky. Through interviews, Hunterbrook learned of at least 20 former employees at the Danville plant who had developed serious health issues.

Most had cancer, but there were also reports of neurological disease and cardiovascular damage. Several also reported dental issues after leaving the plant. Brandy Lake, a former lab employee, experienced issues with her teeth and gums. In total, Brady lost 20 teeth following her time at the plant.

To understand how that could happen, we had to understand what working inside Viscofan actually meant.

Employees said that Viscofan prohibits them — but not supervisors — from bringing mobile devices into the plant. Johnny Gonzalez, a former Viscofan worker, recounted being told by his supervisors that the company was wary of trade secrets being leaked to competitors if pictures were taken.

But nearly 80 photos and videos obtained by Hunterbrook — shared by former employees willing to break company rules to expose the inner workings of the factory — reveal a grim portrait of life in and around the plant.

Inside the Plant

Viscofan is where your hot dog casing comes from — and where workers say the roof crumbles above your head and the walls are eaten away by salt.

Viscofan’s Danville plant manufactures cellulose sausage casings — transparent, high-gloss membranes used to hold hot dogs, ham sausages, and lunch meats. The product is simple. The process to make it is not.

The Danville plant uses the viscose process, a multistage chemical operation involving wood pulp, carbon disulfide, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid. In general, the sequence is controlled: Pulp is steeped in sodium hydroxide, aged, and reacted with carbon disulfide to create sodium cellulose xanthate. That compound is dissolved into viscose — a thick orange liquid — which is extruded into tubes and passed through regenerating acid baths made from sulfuric acid, which results in sodium sulfate. The cellulose is then regenerated into solid casings that are then dried and rolled into reels.

Robert Rust, a retired Iowa State University meat science professor who previously consulted for Teepak, said that this process isn’t unique to Viscofan. “I think that was the only process … for manufacturing those types of cases,” Rust said, noting that just a few companies have ever done it at scale in the United States — namely Viscofan and its competitor, Viskase. He described the market as “a classic oligopoly,” where the basic viscose formula and sulfuric acid bath have been standard for decades.

But standard doesn’t mean safe. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid as Group 1 — carcinogenic to humans — with greater risk in hot, poorly ventilated operations. At Viscofan, former workers said, dangerous exposure is normal.

The consequences could be immediate. Brady recalled a man being sprayed with 93% sulfuric acid — a concentration that can easily cause chemical burns and be corrosive to steel. Instead of calling an ambulance, the safety manager at the site made him wait while they summoned a taxi, Brady said.

Sulfuric acid, in particular, is no trivial chemical in the plant. In 2023, the Danville plant used about 6,700 tons of sulfuric acid, and at any given moment, it maintains two 65,940-gallon tanks of 93% sulfuric acid on-site, according to an Illinois EPA inspection report reviewed by Hunterbrook.

On the floor, it was seen as proof of how even life-threatening emergencies were treated as routine inconveniences inside the plant.

“They would put you under the shower station and if you felt fine after, they tell you to get a set of dry clothes and then get back to work,” one former worker said about acid exposure incidents at the plant.

When the viscose process is run cleanly, emissions are largely contained by scrubbers and solvent recovery systems. At Viscofan, it’s not.

The issues begin before production even starts. Trains bring in tankers of bulk chemicals — namely sulfuric acid — via a side rail that runs directly into the plant. According to photos obtained by Hunterbrook, the ground near the unloading lines is damp with runoff and ripe with dark liquid pooling between the tracks. The liquid, which former employees say is full of chemicals, seeps into gravel and concrete. In at least one instance, the chemical-stained ground was covered by wooden pallets.

Once inside the facility, the breakdowns escalate. Carbon disulfide and hydrogen sulfide — both toxic, flammable gases — are generated during the extrusion phase, where viscose is shaped into its final form. And while the majority of hydrogen sulfide is removed through caustic scrubbers, carbon disulfide is not.

Photos obtained by Hunterbrook show hydrogen sulfide concentrations of 10.7 parts per million on a fixed wall monitor, and up to 40 ppm on a handheld reader inside the plant.

For reference, exposure to just 2 to 5 ppm can cause headaches and nausea. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends no more than 10 ppm of exposure in any 10-minute period, and OSHA sets a ceiling at 20 ppm over an eight-hour window for plants like Viscofan. Brady, the former lab employee, described Viscofan’s heightened levels as a regular occurence, and said evacuations happened roughly three times a year.

According to former workers, some areas of the plant are badly eroded, and rust and cracks in the concrete on the plant floor are common sights. “The ground under the acid tanks is eroded enough to park cars there,” said a person with knowledge of the plant’s operations.

In one picture obtained by Hunterbrook, a large concrete tank marked as “25% CAUSTIC” outside the plant showed significant cracks at its base with liquid seeping through.

Extrusion was especially bad, said Gonzalez, who said he worked at the plant from 2014 to 2016. The area was hot, humid, windowless, and almost pitch-black, and the ventilation was bad, he recalled. Giant rolls of paper were fed into dies, coated with viscose, and run through a series of acid tanks and rollers. When the casing broke, workers had to reach shoulder-deep into chemical baths, their clothes and skin soaked, according to Gonzalez. He said masks were communal, tethered to short air hoses, and often useless for the reach the job required.

“I would like, wake up feeling like I couldn’t breathe,” he recalled. “It felt like something was inside there, clogging it up.”

Outside the building, things don’t improve. Behind the plant are two wastewater basins known as the lagoons. In a 2023 report from the Illinois EPA, an inspector reported that the first of these, the north lagoon, received caustic material from 250-gallon totes of viscose for treatment. The second, the south lagoon, has an outfall that leads directly into the publicly owned treatment works. After the chemical waste is treated, workers routinely dredge the sludge from the lagoons for removal, according to a former employee.

“I couldn’t tell you how many animals have went across there and probably have just become part of whatever the hell is in the bottom of that lake,” said one former employee. That same employee was diagnosed with cancer within six months after leaving Viscofan.

A Record of Excess

Viscofan’s Danville plant has violated the Clean Air Act in seven of the last 12 quarters, according to the EPA. Each of those quarters included a violation marked as “high-priority” — one of the agency’s most serious categories, reserved for violations most likely to significantly harm human health and local environments or threaten the act’s programs.

And yet, the plant continues to operate at full tilt — treating less of its emitted gases on average and releasing carbon disulfide on a scale unmatched by any other casing facility in the country, according to Hunterbrook’s analysis.

In 2023, Viscofan’s Danville plant reported releasing 2.4 million pounds of carbon disulfide into the air. By comparison, the second-largest emitter in the country — Viskase’s Loudon, Tennessee, plant — reported less than 2 million pounds, with no significant violations of the Clean Air Act.

Carbon disulfide is a neurotoxin linked to memory impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular damage. Viscofan’s Danville plant emits an average of nearly 7,000 pounds per day, and a 2019 report from an independent research institute did not note the use of flares or biofilters — even though the Illinois EPA found in 2008 that biofiltration would be possible at the site. In filings with the EPA, the company has argued that carbon disulfide is “required to get cellulose completely into solution” — and warned that “product quality may decline” if it is compelled to reduce it.

Despite a 47% decline in emissions of hydrogen sulfide between 2012 and 2019, levels have since picked up and grown 45%. The plant’s RSEI Hazard score — an EPA measure of toxic exposure — is more than 3,300 times higher than the median among other unlaminated plastics shaping facilities nationwide.

Ammonia is another recurring pollutant. In 2014, Viscofan’s Danville plant reported releasing nearly 339,000 pounds. That number was over 145,000 pounds in 2023 — still high relative to most other casing plants. The company has stated that “reducing the amount used may impact quality and yield.”

Hydrogen sulfide, another toxic gas produced during cellulose conversion, is largely removed by a caustic scrubber, but some is still emitted. According to a report from the Illinois EPA, Viscofan is allowed to release up to 15 pounds per hour — which amounts to tens of thousands of pounds annually.

Solid waste has triggered red flags, too. Street recalled issues at the landfill about five years ago after unwashed casing waste was dumped without proper treatment. “These guys were dumping this casing right into the tote, taking it right to the dumpster,” he said. “Well, this stuff reacts with certain temperatures, so they were having flare-ups.”

He also said the company routinely ran defective machinery that produced unusable product — adding more chemical-laced scrap to the load. “They will run junk all day long,” Street said, “instead of shutting the machine down and trying to fix it.”

One man — who said he used to haul Viscofan’s waste for trash collection company Republic Services — said he witnessed the disposal operation firsthand.

“I saw it with my own eyes,” he told Hunterbrook.

He estimated he’d removed waste from about three 20-yard dumpsters of chemical sludge, three salt-filled 10-yard dumpsters, and compacted trash on a near-daily basis, including most weekends. A photo taken on Viscofan’s property obtained by Hunterbrook shows one such 20-yard dumpster lined with black plastic and stacked with yellow-orange blocks of solid chemical residue, according to the worker. The gelatinous blocks, he explained, are known as “solidified viscose” — the juices squeezed out of meat casings, collected in mini bulk tanks, left to harden, and then dumped once solid.

“It was so bad it rotted the dumpsters out on the bottom,” he said.

But he isn’t the only one who has had issues with the waste generated at Viscofan’s Danville plant. So has the Illinois EPA.

Viscofan produces three major types of solid waste: sodium hydroxide solution, a byproduct of the viscose process; xanthate crumb, the byproduct of the reaction between carbon disulfide and cellulose; and viscose that didn’t meet manufacturing standards.

In 2015, the company officially crossed the line into being “a large quantity generator” of hazardous waste after it produced more than 1,000 kilograms of corrosive sodium hydroxide in a month, according to an Illinois EPA report. By the following year, it also generated over 1,000 kilograms of flammable solids containing carbon disulfide in one month. That classification carried strict obligations: Label every container, store it properly, and ship it off-site within 90 days.

Viscofan did almost none of it, according to records from an inspection by the Illinois EPA on August 10, 2023, after it received a complaint.

On that day, the inspection report indicates, Britney Rutherford, an inspector from the Illinois EPA, asked Alvaro Mendoza, a company representative, how many totes of waste were present in different areas of the plant. He stated that there were approximately 350 totes in total. But when she walked the yard herself, the scale was much greater.

According to the report, Rutherford found more than 1,300 250-gallon totes scattered across Viscofan’s sprawling campus in Danville. Of those totes, some were dated back to 2021; one carried two different dates, marked in 2022 and again in 2023; and some even leaked caustic solution directly onto the ground.

Rutherford asked Mendoza to explain the sheer volume of waste on-site — but instead of acknowledging the backlog, in English he downplayed the problem, according to the report. In Spanish, though, Mendoza told someone that the inspector had exaggerated the count — despite photographs showing row after row of totes scattered across the yard.

“Viscofan is operating an unpermitted hazardous waste landfill,” Rutherford wrote in her report of the site inspection. “Dumping or allowing the continued spills of corrosive wastes onto the ground near the pond constitutes an unpermitted hazardous waste landfill without any of the engineering requirements of an actual landfill.”

The inspection notes also revealed a more systemic failure: Viscofan was misclassifying its waste. Instead of labeling viscose waste when it was first collected, the company waited until it aged and separated. At that point, the sodium hydroxide solution, the harmful part, had already been decanted, and the determination was made only afterward, leading to a misclassification of the hazardous waste.

The company’s own record contradicted that practice. Its contingency plan from November 19 and prior waste shipments to a disposal firm explicitly characterized the viscose solution as corrosive hazardous waste, according to the report. Yet when asked to label totes accordingly, employees apparently marked them as nonhazardous. When regulators requested a proper waste profile three times, Viscofan twice sent profiles only for the solids that had been treated, not for the liquid layer or the untreated waste as it was actually generated, according to the report. Only when Illinois EPA staff arrived on site to take their own samples did the company finally provide a complete profile. It confirmed what was already clear: The viscose solution was a corrosive hazardous waste.

By the end of that inspection, Rutherford was convinced that Viscofan was cutting corners in its waste management process — and slapped the company with 21 violations. She noted that properly disposing of all the discarded and off-spec viscose would cost the company over $700,000.

The violations set off a chain of escalating consequences. On October 30, 2023, the Illinois EPA issued a formal notice of violation. Viscofan delivered its first response on December 18, and barely a month later, on January 18, 2024, company officials were called into a meeting with state regulators to account for what inspectors had found. In that meeting, the plant claimed that the amount of waste Rutherford found was “atypical” — and blamed it on Republic Services, claiming the local trash hauler refused to accept the solidified waste.

By February 8, 2024, Viscofan tried to bargain with a compliance plan — but regulators weren’t buying it. Just a week later, the Illinois EPA warned the matter was so serious it might be handed off to prosecutors. That warning hung over the plant for more than a year, until on June 24, the Illinois EPA made its move: a letter of intent to pursue legal action.

And that is not the only legal problem facing Viscofan. In October 2024, the Illinois EPA referred two different violations to the U.S. EPA for use in separate federal enforcement actions regarding the company’s operations in Danville, according to a spokesperson for the state agency.

One involves a 2023 enforcement action over repeated air permit and emissions reporting violations dating back several years, including failures to properly monitor, test, and document sulfur compound emissions. The other, a 2021 case, centers on emissions-related compliance issues, including alleged lapses in maintenance, recordkeeping, and incident reporting.

The Locals

The harmful impacts of Viscofan’s operations don’t end at the factory’s fence line.

Before process gases are released into the air, Viscofan is required to clean them using a scrubber system — a device that brings polluted air into contact with a liquid to absorb or neutralize contaminants. When functioning properly, a scrubber can remove the vast majority of harmful emissions.

At the Danville plant, however, that isn’t always happening.

According to a picture obtained by Hunterbrook and a person familiar with the plant, stacks fans in one part of the plant — which vent gases from the extrusion process — appeared to be disconnected from the scrubber system responsible for removing harmful emissions. The elbows that would normally connect the fans to the scrubbers are missing, the person said, allowing fumes to vent directly into the atmosphere — unchecked.

Viscofan has been accused of skimping on proper air scrubber practices several times before. In 2015 and 2021, the Illinois EPA issued air-related violations to the plant, alleging that it emitted hydrogen sulfide beyond limit — and that its scrubbers underperformed in controlling toxic releases. In both cases, Viscofan struck compliance commitment agreements, promising better emissions control.

But drone footage of Viscofan taken by Hunterbrook on August 19 suggests that incidents of that kind are not relegated to the past. The video shows at least one stack fan visibly disconnected from its air scrubber, parts of which appear to be scattered across the terrace. The footage also captured the fan venting at the same time — releasing fumes into the air.

Similarly, in an aerial shot taken by Indy Drone Video, an Indiana-based videography group, in June 2023, one of Viscofan’s scrubbers again appears to be inactive — except this time the opposite stack fan is venting freely into the air.

Those same stacks, one person familiar with the plant said, contain equipment meant to measure emissions in parts per million. Federal and state guidelines limit how much can be released.

It is unclear what chemicals could be released from the particular stack vents that Hunterbrook identified as lacking proper scrubber control. An air test conducted independently by Hunterbrook just outside Viscofan’s entrance detected acetonitrile — a colorless, flammable solvent used in industrial processes, including plastics and pharmaceuticals production. It’s also used regularly in the process of casting and molding plastics.

According to the EPA, chronic inhalation of acetonitrile could result in “cyanide poisoning from metabolic release of cyanide after absorption.” The agency also notes that inhalation can affect the central nervous system and result in “headaches, numbness, and tremor.”

Chemicals released by Viscofan present a dual risk in Danville: They can travel through the air via smokestack emissions or leaks, and they can seep into water systems — most notably Lick Creek, a slow-moving waterway behind Viscofan’s industrial wastewater lagoons.

These open-air lagoons are used to store and treat runoff from the plant, located just feet from the creek’s edge. Contaminants from the lagoons can leach into the water table, flow downstream, or evaporate into the surrounding air.

One clear example of this vulnerability occurred last year. On July 10, 2024, Danville received about 4 inches of rainfall — enough to noticeably raise the levels of the lagoons behind the plant relative to levels seen just three days later. With close proximity to Lick Creek, that kind of surge increases the risk of overflow, runoff, and contamination.

The August 19 drone footage shows the lagoon ending just a few feet from the creek’s bank.

In 2013, the Illinois EPA issued a permit for Viscofan’s Danville plant covering discharges to Lick Creek and setting pH and other limits. But Viscofan has repeatedly violated that agreement over the past decade.

The plant operates three outfalls, each discharging into Lick Creek. Since 2014, it has released high-pH and chemically contaminated water into the creek at least 20 times, according to records reviewed by Hunterbrook. Among the chemicals in these incidents: Red Dye 40, a sodium hydroxide solution, and scrubber liquid all flowing into the creek without control because of worker mistakes, poor manufacturing procedures, or aging equipment.

And at times, the contamination has been serious enough to trigger action from the Illinois EPA. In 2015, 2017, and 2018, Viscofan was cited for violating the Illinois Environmental Protection Act in connection with discharges — or conditions that could cause discharges — affecting local waterways.

When a Hunterbrook reporter visited the creek, the smell was sharp and unmistakable — a chemical musk hanging over the water.

Some residents who live near Lick Creek have echoed these concerns online. “They also dump the chemicals in water behind them,” wrote a local, whose home borders the creek. “I live on Daisy Lane by there — dead fish all the time.” Another resident replied, “I was told the same thing.”

In Danville, symptoms tied to chemical exposure aren’t theoretical. They’re routine.

“I’ve been back in Danville now for about 10 years,” said Sheena Morris. “I was born and raised here.” She’s been working full-time at a print shop less than a mile from Viscofan for more than three years now.

“There’s always a smell,” she said. “It gets really bad a couple to three times a week. Sometimes it’s like rotten eggs, like a sulfur smell to it … like a boiling hot dog.”

Her father, Tom Kelly, who owns the shop, has cancer — several types. So did her fiancé, who died last September. Two employees have been diagnosed — one with breast cancer twice, another with skin cancer. Her grandmother died of cancer. “I know a lot more people that have it really at this point in my life than don’t,” she said.

Cases of bottled water were stacked in the entryway and back rooms of Morris’ ink shop when a Hunterbrook reporter visited. Some locals don’t drink from the tap.

“We just don’t trust it,” Morris said. “I smell just a bunch of chlorine. They’re constantly treating it and then sending out notices about that too.”

When asked about the community response, she was blunt: “Nobody does really anything about that.”

“It employs people. So they’re not pushing back because they need the jobs in this community,” she added.

The health impacts she described are echoed in public data. Between 2018 and 2022, Danville’s 61832 zip code recorded 1,196 cancer cases — an annual rate of about 700 per 100,000 people. That’s far above the Illinois state average of 561.

And while there is no direct proof of a causal connection between the chemicals emitted by the factory and the health outcomes in the surrounding areas, community sentiment certainly lays some blame at Viscofan’s feet.

“My dad worked there when I was a kid,” wrote a local on a community Facebook page. “He would come home in the morning after working 3rd and the Pennie’s in his pocket would be green. … Place is nasty.”

“Came home smelling like cat pee,” another local recalled of her boyfriend who worked at the plant. “Some there have to wear mask[s]. It’s bad for the workers and environment.”

A local who said they worked at Viscofan recalled the factory removing its smokestack and facing repeated fines: “If there not burning off the chemicals I don’t see why the people living in the area can’t sue them.”

One woman said her father died of cancer after working at the plant. Another person said he knew multiple workers who died of heart attacks in their 40s. One local called Danville the “cess pool of the country.” Others described the plant as toxic and explosive: “It can even lead to infertility in women.”

Don’t Talk, Don’t Ask

Street started working in maintenance at Viscofan in 2016. At first, he liked it. “I thought, ‘Man, this is great,’” he said. “Days off, swing shift, rotating shift — what I wanted to do.”

But over time, the problems piled up. He said proper safety precautions often weren’t followed, and workers handled a slew of toxic chemicals without proper respiratory protection. “I had to take breaths, had to get down from where I was at before I lost my breath and actually passed out,” he said.

He also recalled a serious injury. “That one girl got her arm stuck in the roller,” Street said. “It literally rolled her arm for, like, 10 minutes before they actually got her out.”

For two to three years, he said, he lifted heavy weights completely alone. “I was lifting these 65-70,000 pound dies by myself and hanging them up in these bays and these tanks by myself.”

When he raised concerns about safety and contamination, he believed it made him a target. “They got rid of me because I was vocal,” he said. “I’m very vocal about stuff. … You can’t run from me. I’m gonna express my concerns and opinions about it.”

One day during lunch shortly after he raised complaints, he rested his head on top of his toolbox, he said. A Viscofan executive took a photo and accused him of sleeping. Street said he still had time left on his break and wasn’t asleep. The photo was used to put him on a “last chance agreement,” he said. He was later fired for “performance.”

“My performance? I said, ‘I was here for seven years and now all of a sudden my work performance is a problem,’” Street recalled telling his boss.

He said he wasn’t alone. Other workers who spoke up, he said, were also walked out.

And the woman who got her hand caught in the machine? “They just paid her off. Well, don’t say nothing about it,” he said.

The Union Collapse

For years, Viscofan’s union had been a buffer between management and workers — a place employees could take grievances about safety, conditions, and retaliation. But in May of this year, that structure effectively collapsed.

In a May 20 letter to hourly employees that was shared with Hunterbrook, Viscofan wrote that it was “withdrawing recognition” of the local chapter of the union represented by the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, claiming that a majority had signed a petition requesting the move. Effective immediately, the company suggested, the union would no longer represent them. In the same breath, the CEO of Viscofan’s U.S. operations promised wage increases and new benefits — coming soon.

Whether Viscofan’s move is legal isn’t clear-cut. Traditionally, a union can be decertified through a secret-ballot election run by the National Labor Relations Board. But U.S. law also allows it if an employer has objective evidence the union has lost majority support — as Viscofan seemingly suggested in its letter to employees.

But by pledging raises and benefits in the same letter, the company risked appearing to offer incentives for rejecting union representation — a move that could violate federal labor law.

Michael C. Duff, a professor at the Saint Louis University School of Law and a former NLRB attorney, expressed skepticism about the company’s decision.

“The idea that it put references to improvements in benefits in a letter that it sent all employees suggests to me that either they don’t have the advice of counsel, or it’s possible that somebody doesn’t know U.S. labor law,” he said.

In a letter to Viscofan’s CEO on September 16, four members of the Congressional Labor Caucus also cast doubt on Viscofan’s letter to workers. They declared that the May letter to workers “clearly violates the National Labor Relations Act” and pointed to the company’s alleged attempt last year to pressure employees into signing a petition to weaken the union’s ability to collect dues.

They called on the company to negotiate honestly with the union. Yet today, the future of union protection for Viscofan workers remains unclear, and the union’s May 28 challenge before the NLRB has made little progress.

According to Alec Severins — the head of Vermilion County Watchdog, a community Facebook page — the company’s decision to unrecognize the union came shortly after he began looking into claims of runoff behind Viscofan’s anhydrous tanks and sharing concerns with union representatives. “Their union is real big on safety,” he said.

He described it as the tipping point in what had already been years of escalating tension between management and organized labor. “Union troubles have been going on for a few years,” he said. “But we haven’t seen anything like this happen.” (In 2019, workers at Viscofan’s Danville plant went on strike, leading the company to quickly sign a new collective bargaining agreement.)

Since then, Severins said, many employees feel they’ve been left with no option but silence. “Right now, since the union’s gone, they feel like they can’t speak up,” he said. “They’ll be retaliated against.”

The collapse of the union also coincided with a quiet shift in Viscofan’s workforce. Lake, the former lab employee, and one other employee said that by 2022, as much as 75% of Viscofan’s workforce in Danville had been hired from the company’s plants outside of the continental U.S. (Viscofan has manufacturing sites in Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, China, and seven other countries outside of the U.S.).

Viscofan declined to comment on the makeup of workers at its Danville facility or the legality of its decision to withdraw recognition of the union.

Tim Miller, a former Viscofan employee, wrote in a post on Facebook that the shift in hiring practices was tied directly to the union’s weakening over the years. Without local hires and without a powerful union, he wrote, there were fewer protections. “They want to rid this place of the union and turn it into a minimum wage hell hole,” he wrote. “Bottom line. It’s their way or the highway. They show no respect for a binding CBA.”

Street, the former maintenance worker, echoed similar concerns. He said a strong union had once been a line of defense against dangerous conditions and retaliation. Without it, workers feared the worst.

“Now that these guys won’t have union representation, it’s going to be even worse,” he said. “Who you gonna go tell?”

Viscofan declined to address any of the allegations raised by workers — including unsafe working conditions, uncontrolled pollution, inadequate emission controls, and reported retaliation against those who spoke out. Instead, a spokesperson for the company insisted that it met “strict local and international standards for quality, safety, and employee well-being.”

No Protection

Viscofan’s Danville plant relies on highly toxic and corrosive chemicals, but former workers say basic protective gear was scarce and safety protocols were rarely enforced.

One former worker in the chemical department said he was routinely burned through his gloves by caustic substances. “You were on a two-pair-of-gloves limit a week,” he said. “As soon as your hand hit caustic, the gloves were ruined.”

“I don’t know how many pairs of gloves I was basically forced to wear, because they’re like, ‘No, I can’t give you any more — I’ve reached the limit,’” he added.

He recalled finishing shifts with his pants and shirts soaked in chemicals. “That stuff gets on you — it burns you,” he said. “I’ve probably still got scars on my hands.” Workers were told to rinse chemical burns with soap and water — a method he later found out could irritate the caustic even further. When he tried to raise concerns about exposure risks or ventilation, he said little changed. “Unless there’s a life or death situation, they pretty much brush it off,” he said.

Gonzalez, who worked for two years at the plant, recalled asking his supervisors to replace a drip pan in the plant — a metal tray meant to catch chemicals. The existing one, he said, had been removed, leaving chemicals dripping onto him for months.

“It took them about three months to put another drip pan on there,” he said. “I feel like they don’t really care about their employees at all.”

Johnson, the longtime Viscofan worker who first joined the plant under Teepak in the 1970s, added that respiratory protection was almost nonexistent at first. “They didn’t have masks or anything else. You just did what you wanted,” he said. In his later years, he noticed management began encouraging younger workers to wear masks, but never enforced it across the board.

Brady, who worked in Viscofan’s lab for more than four years, recalled trying to evacuate a workspace due to gas levels above the safety threshold. “As I proceeded to do that due to the exhaust fans not working,” she said, “the supervisors and the higher-ups in management said they are fine and to keep working — and refused to evacuate the employees.”

Others voiced even deeper distrust. Some former lab workers alleged that they had been asked to falsify internal safety data — and that outside oversight was limited. “Every time somebody tries to make a complaint to OSHA, nothing ever gets done,” said Lake, who said she was responsible for recording Viscofan’s gas levels inside the plant.

“I was told by the person training me to only write down good numbers and not to bother the supervisors about the bad readings because they would not do anything anyway,” she recalled.

When she did record actual gas levels and reported them once they became concerning, her warnings were dismissed. She said she was told that “there was nothing they could do because their hands were tied by the owners of Viscofan.”

Several others echoed the sentiment, saying they believe regulators routinely ignored or overlooked issues.

Even major safety certifications, one worker alleged, were treated like pageantry. Street said the plant’s BRC audits usually ended with a barely passing grade. When a new auditor came in, he initially failed the facility outright. A month or two later, he returned and gave the plant a glowing score. Street said nothing changed between the two visits, with the exception that Viscofan “hadn’t swayed him” the first time around.

Despite years of allegations, Viscofan has faced limited OSHA enforcement. The most serious, and expensive, action came only in July 2024, when the agency cited Viscofan’s Danville facility for one repeat violation, seven serious violations, and one other-than-serious violation. The initial penalties totaled just under $200,000 and documented incidents where workers were hospitalized, caught in rollers, and burned with hazardous chemicals, all with insufficient preventative action taken by the company.

But according to photos of notices posted inside the plant and obtained by Huntebrook, Viscofan has received at least three complaints since 2022. The complaints allege that workers were exposed to shock and burn hazards, unlevel and trip-prone working surfaces, and harmful levels of carbon disulfide and ammonia — claiming the plant had “not implemented controls” to remove hazardous gases from the breathing area.

For now, oversight has come in bursts before fading back into the hum of daily life. On paper, the system has worked: the penalties are paid and the doors stay open. But in Danville, the air still smells the same.

In town, there’s perhaps no one who knows Viscofan better than Deborah Stacey. She lives just across the road, in a sagging house where the lawn has grown wild and chairs and tables lie flipped all around.

She’s a squatter, sick with cancer — and she’s learned to live with the industrial hum, and smell, that settles over her front porch every night.

“Sometimes you gotta have bad odor with good odor, you know,” Stacey said. “Because if we ain’t got the bad odor, then you might as well forget the good one.”

Other EV makers are sticking it out but just shoving money on the hood to try and make up for the tax credit.","The federal electric vehicle tax credit expired at the end of September, and it’s predictably been the cause of some minor chaos— but it's also led to a number of new ideas from automakers.

Nobody headed to the dealership today will be able to take advantage of the $7500 in savings afforded by the tax credit. The situation varied by model, but in many cases, the change meant the effective price for many consumers buying EVs went up $7500 overnight. Automakers understand this to be an unsavory position that’s unlikely to encourage sales, so many of them have taken matters into their own hands. From creative loopholes proposed and cancelled to traditional discounts and all-out vehicle cancellations, there’s a little of everything going on right now,

We thought it might be handy to run through some of the big moves, so keep scrolling to see what automakers are up to in order to keep buyers coming to showrooms and driving off in new electric cars.

Hyundai

Hyundai simply dropped the price of its 2026 Ioniq 5 as a response to the tax credit disappearing. The base model went down $7600, and other trims went down by as much as $9800. That’s not a massive cut in the context of what you would’ve effectively paid with the tax credit, but it sure is preferable to the price staying exactly the same.

Ford and General Motors

Ford and General Motors both thought they had come up with a genius loophole to maintain the tax credit discount for cars on the lot. Both the FoMoCo and GM in-house lending arms were planning to initiate the purchase of EVs in inventory while the credit was still applicable, and then pass those savings onto the customers who would ultimately lease the vehicles. It drew ire from a certain U.S. senator, however, and the plan was quickly put to bed just as rapidly as it was proposed.

The above said, neither Ford nor GM are continuing unchanged. Ford told Road & Track that it will “maintain the competitive lease payments” it offers now and continue to offer 0% financing for 72 months for those who wish to purchase an EV.

Meanwhile, GM has simply promised to “fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October” to keep prices in check for buyers.

Stellantis

Stellantis never joined its crosstown rivals in the tax credit loophole scheme, but it has come through and replicated the savings of the federal tax credit through incentives applied to its EVs. That means EVs like the Dodge Charger Daytona and Jeep Wagoneer S will still be $7500 less than what the sticker says.

Tesla

Tesla went with the intriguing strategy of coming out with new, “Standard” trims of both its Model 3 and Model Y. These models start $5000-$5500 less than the trims above them, but even after removing content and luxuries aplenty, that’s still not enough to completely make up for the $7500 tax credit it loses. (If you’re curious to read about all the details surrounding these Standard trim models, you can find the full story here.)

Honda / Acura

Acura ended production of the ZDX electric SUV with the announcement coming right at the end of September. It was only here for a single year, and Acura’s statement to Car and Driver cites “market conditions” as one of the reasons it’s been eliminated. Consider this one a tangential victim of the tax credit—and for what it’s worth, its Honda Prologue sibling is still trucking along.

Mercedes-Benz

Mercedes-Benz made waves in July when it announced both the EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs would be put on pause in the U.S. All vehicles scheduled for production prior to September 1 were to be produced, but nothing after that would be made for the U.S. market. This timing suggests Mercedes is responding to the EV tax credit disappearing, though the closest that the brand's statements came to saying as much is when it cited “market conditions” as a reason for the pause.

Other EV makers are sticking it out but just shoving money on the hood to try and make up for the tax credit.

On September 15, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reinstated a policy from the first Trump administration that the agency would not ""second-guess"" pre-project emissions projections made by permit applicants in New Source Review (NSR) permitting. Specifically, EPA re-issued a 2017 memorandum, titled ""New Source Review Preconstruction Permitting Requirements: Enforceability and Use of the Actual-to-Projected-Actual Applicability Test in Determining Major Modification Applicability.""

Before beginning construction of a project, the Actual-to-Projected-Actual Applicability (APTA) test is utilized to determine whether a proposed project at an existing source triggers NSR permitting by comparing pre-project actual emissions with the projected post-project actual emissions. With the reinstatement of the 2017 policy, EPA is clarifying that ""when a source owner or operator performs a pre-project NSR applicability analysis in accordance with the calculation procedures in the regulations, and follows the applicable recordkeeping and notification requirements in the regulations, that owner or operator has met the pre-project source obligations of the regulations, unless there is clear error (e.g. the source applies the wrong significance threshold)."" As long as the owner or operator complies with the regulatory requirements, EPA will not ""substitute its judgment for that of the owner or operator by 'second guessing' the owner or operator's emissions projections."" The 2017 policy also clarifies that the intent of an owner or operator to manage emissions from a unit after a project is completed is relevant information that may be considered when projecting future actual emissions.

The 6th Circuit's opinion in U.S. v. DTE Energy Co., 711 F.3d 643 (6th Cir. 2013), held that EPA has the authority to pursue enforcement based solely on an allegedly improper projection of future emissions even though actual emissions from the source had not increased. The ""no second-guessing"" policy indicates that as long as an owner or operator makes a good-faith projection about a project's emissions increase (or lack thereof), EPA will exercise its discretion and not pursue enforcement ""unless post-project actual emissions data indicate that a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase did in fact occur.""EPA will look to the actual emissions during the 5- or 10-year recordkeeping or reporting period to assess whether a significant emissions increase has occurred.As such, the policy indicates that EPA will use its substantial discretion to restrict enforcement for mere projection errors that did not result in post-project significant actual emissions increases or significant net increases and will reserve enforcement for matters where post-project actual emissions indicate that an NSR permit is required.

EPA's reinstatement of its ""no second-guessing"" policy comes on the heels of its September 2, 2025, interpretation of ""begin actual construction,"" wherein the Agency previewed its current stance on the topic and signaled its intention to amend the NSR regulations to authorize a broader set of construction activities before (or without) receiving an NSR permit.

Many crops, including fruits and nuts, depend on a steady stretch of “chill time” beginning in early fall to ensure healthy yields.","ATLANTA — If fall feels a little warmer — and a lot longer — than it used to, you’re not imagining things.

A new study shows every county in the contiguous U.S. has warmed since 1970 due to climate change. Not only has this led to higher energy bills and a longer allergy season, the trend has significantly pushed back first fall freeze dates.

“In fact, of 204 cities analyzed, 88% of them see their first fall freeze happen on average almost two weeks later,” said Climate Central meteorologist Shel Winkley. “In places like Reno, Nevada, and Bend, Oregon, that delay is typically more than a month.”

It’s not only happening in the West. From coast to coast, fall is losing some of its familiar chill.

Climate Central’s study shows Toledo, Ohio’s first freeze is arriving 29 days later on average than in the 1970s; Philadelphia typically sees its first frost 20 days later; and Nashville and New York don’t get frosty until about two weeks later than they used to.

While summer lovers may not see a problem, the consequences can be costly. Later freezes are known to affect health, agriculture and the environment.

“It can stretch allergy season longer, give pests like mosquitoes more time to buzz and thrive, and even reduce the quality of fruit and nut crops that depend on colder temperatures,” Winkley said. “It also affects fall color, farming schedules and local ecosystems.”

The first freeze is more than just a weather milestone — it’s a biological signal. Farmers rely on predictable freeze dates for planting, harvesting and pest control. While a later freeze and longer growing season can mean more time for crops to grow, it also opens up more opportunities for pests and diseases to thrive.

Many crops, including fruits and nuts, depend on a steady stretch of “chill time” beginning in early fall to ensure healthy yields. However, since 1980, Climate Central reports 181 locations have seen this chilling period shrink.

Beyond farms and forests, fall warming throws off the natural timing for birds to migrate and animals to hibernate.

The evidence is clear: Cooler falls are history thanks to climate change. Now, like Mother Nature, we have to find new ways to adapt.",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/CCT/images/eff04cf8-becd-45fd-81bb-62ae7358b042/20251013T205859/eff04cf8-becd-45fd-81bb-62ae7358b042_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:14:14.005851

Today, New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) issued its quarterly short-term assessment of reliability (STAR) report for the state grid. The report predicts possible deficiencies in electricity supply for New York City, Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley, starting next year and growing through 2030. The report follows the cancellation of two critical transmission projects to serve New York City. For the next few years, new battery storage can supply most or all the identified need, and more electric transmission (particularly into New York City) can solve longer-term issues.

New York leaders have repeatedly failed to follow through on clean energy, storage, and transmission projects that would have supplied New York with abundant, affordable, clean energy. The cancelled 175-mile Clean Path NY transmission line, which was to be built by 2027, would have brought 1,300MW into New York City before 2030. In July, the New York State Public Service Commission abandoned efforts to develop a transmission project to connect multiple offshore wind farms to provide clean energy and meet growing demand. That project could have lowered costs by $40 to $70 billion from 2033 to 2052. That’s on top of the approximately 50,000 MW of mostly clean energy projects stuck in the interconnection queue, which could be built faster and cheaper than new gas.

Instead, NYISO may recommend that dirty, expensive, gas-burning power plants continue to operate in New York City and Long Island. This would be:

Expensive for New Yorkers

Devastating to frontline communities who have borne the brunt of health impacts from harmful pollution in their neighborhoods for decades

Contrary to the state mandates to clean up the energy system to reduce costs and transition to non-emitting sources of energy

Moreover, the report does not support a NYISO executive’s suggestion of a potential need for “several thousand megawatts of new dispatchable generation.” The identified need in the report is resource neutral. Battery storage, transmission, and other cheap, clean resources can address the need. Meanwhile, NYISO’s own rigorous evaluations of resource adequacy reveal that the statewide system has between 192% and 1,250% of the industry-standard protection against loss of load events. NYISO’s quarterly report confirms that resource adequacy criteria are still met.

Earthjustice statement of Liz Moran, New York Policy Advocate:

“If Governor Hochul is truly committed to an affordable energy agenda for New Yorkers, she will respond to this NYISO report with a plan to dramatically accelerate new transmission and battery storage. NYISO’s dangerous suggestion to keep dirty gas-plants operating in New York City and Long Island lacks factual support and not only runs counter to our landmark climate law, but would also harm health and drive up energy prices for all New Yorkers. As the federal administration raises costs for everyday Americans just to benefit the oil and gas industry, New Yorkers are counting on Governor Hochul to exhibit true leadership by building our clean, renewable future – not more fracked gas pipelines or power plants.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-10-14 13:02:49.310057

Nuclear growth: For nuclear energy, “a new generation of large-scale nuclear reactors is being built in several countries with enhanced features, and small modular reactors are under development,” according to the report.
By 2030, the Asia Pacific region, led by China, “will dominate solar PV, wind and nuclear generation,” the report predicts.

China is seen as dominating the nuclear, solar, and wind power sectors by 2030, according to the report.

Main conclusions: The report’s findings show that more than 60 percent of global electricity will come from renewable sources—largely solar and wind, followed by nuclear—by 2030. Data centers could be responsible for driving a 23 percent annual increase in U.S. power needs up to that time.

Three forecast scenarios based on different levels of U.S. government support for climate/clean energy goals are examined, with the findings that in any of these three possible government policy scenarios, energy from clean and renewable sources will surpass traditional sources by 2035 at the latest.

The report also notes that the growth of distributed commercial, industrial, and residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, together with pending technological advancements in such areas as battery storage, is creating “new opportunities for downstream players to integrate, manage, and maintain these systems.” These opportunities go beyond the traditional roles of simply delivering and maintaining physical components of the energy grid.

Nuclear growth: For nuclear energy, “a new generation of large-scale nuclear reactors is being built in several countries with enhanced features, and small modular reactors are under development,” according to the report. By 2030, nuclear will account for at least 9 percent of global electricity generation, making for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2 percent.

By contrast, solar PV will account for at least 17 percent of global electricity generation (19 percent CAGR), and wind will provide at least 13 percent (10 percent CAGR) by 2030.

Expansion in Asia: The report identifies key drivers of nuclear growth in China, which has committed to increasing its non–fossil fuel energy share to 20 percent by 2030.

By 2030, the Asia Pacific region, led by China, “will dominate solar PV, wind and nuclear generation,” the report predicts. By that time, Asia will have a total of 193 GWe of installed nuclear electricity generating capacity, and Asian capacity will reach 423 GWe by 2050. By contrast, the installed nuclear electricity generating capacity numbers for 2030 and 2050 will be, respectively, 110 GWe and 228 GWe in North America, and 148 GWe and 247 GWe in Europe.

Headwinds in Europe and America: The analysis points out that the European Union “is setting new renewable energy targets for 2040, though these plans face challenges due to differing views on including nuclear power in the renewable energy mix.”

In the United States, half of the nuclear generating capacity is more than 30 years old, and “major investments are required” to boost the nuclear sector, the report states.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb3c57e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4d%2Fe4%2Fbb1ded484b42b9984b85ed346946%2Fgm-ren-cen-may-2023.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 12:12:53.826136

Canada’s drive toward net-zero by 2050 requires a dramatic expansion of storage capacity. By 2030, the country is projected to have as many as 5 million light-duty EVs on the road (Source: NRCan/Dunsky).

To align with climate targets, dedicated Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) capacity will need to rise above 12,000 MW by the end of this decade (Source: Canadian Climate Institute/Navius Research).

The AI platform from BluWave-ai directly addresses the complexity of managing this massive, dual-front energy transition:

Enabling Dispatchable Renewables with the Sunbank Solar Farm(City of Summerside): The Smart Grid Optimizer is deployed for the Sunbank Solar Farm (a joint venture with Samsung Renewables) integrated with Microsoft Azure. The AI deployment allows the utility to deliver clean energy on demand and reducing reliance on traditional peak generation methods around highly variable solar and wind energy.

Maximizing Performance of New Grid-Scale Batteries: The Energy Storage Autopilot AI is being deployed with major partners, including a project with Evolugen, to maximize the lifetime performance, reliability, and financial returns of their grid-scale batteries. This is key to efficiently managing the estimated 4 GW of battery storage planned for the Ontario grid.

Grid Infrastructure Deferment: Collaborations such as with Area X.O, Hydro Ottawa, and Moment Energy use AI to optimize multiple battery systems alongside EVs. This strategy helps defer costly distribution grid infrastructure upgrades, reinforcing the potential for AI-driven digitalization to deliver massive savings (estimated at $1.8 trillion globally by 2050 by the IEA).

“BluWave-ai’s innovative technologies are empowering the global evolution of traditional electrical grids toward more sustainable, efficient, and resilient software-defined smart grids,” added Dr. Thomas Triplet, VP of Technology at BluWave-ai, “Our portfolio covers foundational inventions of AI driven systems management for our utility and transport customers, ensuring our solutions are not just groundbreaking, but also highly effective and scalable in the face of growing energy demands.”

“This award validates our strategy of applying advanced AI, secured by a growing patent portfolio and massive data scale, to every part of the global energy transition,” said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. “Our technology is designed to make renewable energy more reliable and electric transportation more efficient. EVs are projected to reach 4-5 GW of storage capacity as an aggregate across Canada which is the equivalent to 17 small modular nuclear reactors. By mastering AI-driven optimization for EVs, stationary storage, and renewable generation, we are actively modernizing Canada’s electricity grids and demonstrating the intelligent software foundation required for a graceful energy transition.”

The EV tax credit ended last month.
The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.
In 2021, GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next.","General Motors will record a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration moves to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California's ban on new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges, mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021, GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD's sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world's other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

This delivery marks an operational milestone as the Company prepares to begin commissioning its first U.S.-based waste conversion system.

""Our team has been working tirelessly to reach this point,"" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman and CEO of Waste Energy Corp. ""This first feedstock delivery marks the true beginning of our mission - diverting waste that once polluted our landfills and converting it into clean, profitable energy for a sustainable future.""

Turning Waste Into Energy for the AI Age

Every year, millions of pounds of non-recyclable plastic and tires end up in landfills, leaching toxins into the environment. Waste Energy Corp's proprietary waste conversion system is designed to divert and convert this waste into high-value fuels, carbon black, carbon credits and other renewable energy products - generating strong margins while reducing environmental impact.

""As global demand for energy skyrockets - driven by the exponential growth of AI, data centers, and electrification - the world urgently needs new, scalable sources of clean energy,"" continued Gallagher. ""Waste Energy Corp sits at the intersection of two megatrends: environmental sustainability and the accelerating need for power to fuel the age of AI.""

Patent-Pending Blockchain-Based Carbon Credit Automation

In addition to producing clean fuel, Waste Energy Corp is developing a patent-pending blockchain-based carbon credit automation and trading platform that will capture, verify, and monetize emissions data directly from its conversion systems in real time.

The Patent Pending system - built to integrate IoT sensors, AI-driven verification, and blockchain-based transaction records - will enable automated creation and trading of carbon credits generated through the Company's waste diversion and fuel production activities. Each verified ton of emissions reduction will be tokenized and traded on WEC's forthcoming automated carbon credit creation marketplace, offering a new recurring revenue stream with global scalability and enormous ESG value to companies.

""This technology converts every pound of waste we divert from landfills and processes it into not just clean fuel, but measurable environmental value,"" said Gallagher. ""Our automated carbon credit system allows Waste Energy Corp to directly participate in the multi-billion-dollar global carbon markets - creating a financial layer on top of our physical operations.""

Building a Profitable and Sustainable Energy Platform

At full capacity, the Company's Midland facility is expected to process up to 90 tons of waste per day, generating over $10 million in annual revenue with gross profit margins exceeding 50%. Each ton of diverted waste represents both an environmental win and a monetizable resource - transformed into clean diesel and reusable carbon materials rather than buried in a landfill.

""This first feedstock delivery is a reminder of why we built this business - to prove that doing good for the planet and doing well for our shareholders can be the same mission,"" Gallagher concluded.

According to EPA, additional NSR guidance and policy developments may follow, as well as a potential rulemaking to codify certain aspects of the Agency’s new approach to preconstruction permitting under the NSR Program.
This summary addresses how EPA’s new approach to the NSR Program might impact stationary source projects.
The court reasoned that CAA Section 165 unambiguously limits NSR permitting requirements only to “construction” that is “commenced after August 7, 1977.” The court additionally held that “construction” within the meaning of the NSR regulations also includes modification.
Therefore, according to the court, NSR permitting requirements apply only to facilities constructed or modified after August 7, 1977, regardless of operational status (e.g., idled, shut down) or operator intent.","The New Source Review (“NSR”) Program under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) requires new major stationary sources and existing major stationary sources making major modifications to undergo permitting prior to beginning construction; a process that could take several years and result in stringent emissions control technology requirements. Given its scope, the NSR Program may impact the development of a wide range of facilities across various sectors, including power plants, refineries, manufacturing facilities, and data centers, among others. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) recently has announced a suite of policy developments and a forthcoming rulemaking that attempt to clarify when NSR preconstruction permitting is required and could limit the lead time for development of both new facilities and modifications at existing facilities.

EPA’s new NSR policies establish revised interpretations of certain regulatory requirements for preconstruction permitting under the CAA. These developments effectuate the Administration’s ongoing initiatives to simplify and streamline permitting processes and reduce regulatory “red tape” for projects powering advancements in the nation’s industrial and energy sectors. According to EPA, additional NSR guidance and policy developments may follow, as well as a potential rulemaking to codify certain aspects of the Agency’s new approach to preconstruction permitting under the NSR Program.

This summary addresses how EPA’s new approach to the NSR Program might impact stationary source projects.

Withdrawal of Reactivation Policy

On September 18, 2025, EPA issued a memorandum, New Source Review Program “Reactivation Policy” (“Reactivation Memorandum”), announcing that the Agency will no longer apply its longstanding “Reactivation Policy” in permitting and enforcement actions under the NSR Program on a national basis. In a September 15, 2025 press release announcing the Reactivation Memorandum, EPA stated that its new approach should “allow[] for idled facilities like power plants[,] which are desperately needed to provide electricity much faster,” to be brought back into operation under the NSR Program.

Implemented by the Agency under various articulations in guidance and permitting actions since the 1970s, EPA’s Reactivation Policy applied a rebuttable presumption that existing major stationary sources that have “permanently” shut down, or otherwise have been removed from a state’s emissions inventory, but are seeking to restart operations, are considered “new” and therefore subject to the NSR Program. However, the Agency has, at times, expressed skepticism over the Policy’s validity under both the CAA and its NSR Program regulations. Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (“Third Circuit”) recently rejected EPA’s application of the Reactivation Policy to require a preconstruction permit for the resumption of operations at an existing major stationary source previously considered to have permanently ceased operations. See Port Hamilton Refining & Transp. LLLP v. EPA, 75 F.4th 166 (3d Cir. 2023) (“Port Hamilton”). The court reasoned that CAA Section 165 unambiguously limits NSR permitting requirements only to “construction” that is “commenced after August 7, 1977.” The court additionally held that “construction” within the meaning of the NSR regulations also includes modification. Therefore, according to the court, NSR permitting requirements apply only to facilities constructed or modified after August 7, 1977, regardless of operational status (e.g., idled, shut down) or operator intent. As a result of the decision, EPA was precluded from applying the Reactivation Policy within the jurisdiction of the Third Circuit.

EPA now explains in the Reactivation Memorandum that it agrees with the Third Circuit’s interpretation of the CAA. Consistent with Port Hamilton, EPA will no longer apply the Reactivation Policy “to classify resuming operation of a stationary source as construction of a new source in EPA permitting and enforcement actions” or in its “oversight of state, local, and tribal air permitting programs.” EPA intends to implement its new approach on a national basis, which would bring nationwide application of NSR requirements in line with the approach currently in place within the jurisdiction of the Third Circuit. The nationwide application is based on EPA’s determination that the Port Hamilton decision reflects the “best read[ing]” of the CAA, similar decisions in four other U.S. Courts of Appeals on the scope of the CAA’s NSR requirements, and the “strong interest in equal treatment among sources and nationwide uniformity” under the CAA.

EPA encourages state, local, and tribal air agencies to follow its new approach “where doing so is consistent with applicable law in their jurisdictions.” However, the Agency explains in the Reactivation Memorandum that its new policy does not preclude local permitting authorities from implementing local requirements for preconstruction permitting for reactivating idle sources “where those policies … are more stringent than the CAA.” Furthermore, EPA plans to evaluate on a case-by-case basis “the extent to which it is necessary to enforce or revisit its approval of State Implementation Plans” containing requirements based in the now-withdrawn Reactivation Policy or are otherwise “not independently supported by state or local laws.”

Notwithstanding EPA’s new policy, the Agency will continue to apply NSR permitting requirements to modification at sources that have been shut down. Therefore, where an idled source seeks to make modifications to restart operations, the modifications must be analyzed to determine whether they are considered “major modifications” that are subject to the NSR Program.

Revised Interpretation of “Begin Actual Construction”

The NSR Program’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Nonattainment New Source Review (“NNSR”) regulations at 40 C.F.R. §§ 52.21 and 51.165, respectively, require that “[n]o new major stationary source or major modification to which [PSD or NNSR requirements apply] shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements.” The phrase “begin actual construction” means, “in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature.” 40 C.F.R. §§ 52.21(b)(11), 51.165(a)(1) (emphasis added).

On September 2, 2025, EPA issued a letter to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (“MCAQD”) clarifying the Agency’s interpretation of these requirements. MCAQD originally sought EPA’s opinion on whether an NSR permit was required prior to the initial stage of construction activities at a semiconductor manufacturing facility, which consisted of construction of the core and shell of a building that would eventually house the emission unit. In the letter, EPA explained that its previous interpretation of the federal NSR regulations adopted “an overly broad reading” of the term “emissions unit,” by construing the term to include “installations necessary to accommodate an emission unit.” According to the letter to MCAQD, EPA now interprets its NSR regulations to allow certain construction activities, such as the construction of the core and shell of a building, to occur prior to issuance of an NSR permit, so long as the construction does not involve “the physical construction on an emission unit” itself or, in accordance with MCAQD’s regulations, “the laying of underground piping or construction of supports and foundations that are part of any emissions unit.”

EPA plans to undertake a rulemaking to codify its new interpretation and clarify which construction activities require or do not require an NSR permit to proceed. According to a September 9, 2025 press release, EPA anticipates that this rulemaking will provide “flexibility to begin certain building activities that are not related to air emissions,” streamline preconstruction permitting, and reduce potential project delays. In the rulemaking, the Agency intends to revise the definition of “begin actual construction” so that it is tied specifically to the construction of the emissions unit itself. The rulemaking also may adopt a narrower definition of “emissions unit.”

According to the Office of Management and Budget’s Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, EPA expects to issue a proposed rule in January 2026 and a final rule in September 2026.

Reissuance of “No Second Guessing” Memorandum

In a press release issued on September 15, 2025, EPA announced for the first time that the Agency has reissued its December 7, 2017, memorandum, New Source Review Preconstruction Permitting Requirements: Enforceability and Use of the Actual-to-Projected-Actual Applicability (“APTA”) Test in Determining Major Modification Applicability (“2017 Memorandum), also known as the “no second guessing” memorandum. EPA originally issued the 2017 Memorandum to outline the Agency’s intended approach to NSR enforcement for existing major stationary sources undertaking modifications in light of a series of decisions from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit involving certain NSR enforcement actions. The 2017 Memorandum had been rescinded by EPA on December 9, 2022, with no rationale provided.

Now, with the reissuance of the 2017 Memorandum, EPA’s interpretation of the NSR program and its NSR enforcement policy, as discussed in the 2017 Memorandum, are back in effect. In the 2017 Memorandum, EPA explained that it would interpret the NSR regulations to permit the consideration of a project owner’s intent to actively manage future emissions from a proposed project at an existing major stationary source, which would allow the project owner to prevent significant emissions increases from a project that would have to be taken into account when calculating the project’s projected actual emissions.

EPA also explained its view that the NSR rules provide “no mechanism” for the Agency to review a source’s exclusion of emissions that (1) could have been accommodated during the baseline period, and (2) are unrelated to the project. EPA further clarified that owners/operators would be considered to have met their pre-project requirements under the NSR regulations if they performed a pre-project NSR applicability analysis in accordance with the regulations and followed the applicable recordkeeping and notification requirements, “unless there is clear error (e.g. the source applies the wrong significance threshold).” Importantly, EPA stated that it does not intend to pursue enforcement for projects that would result in less than significant emission increases or net emission increases, unless post-project actual emissions data indicated that a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase did, in fact, occur.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16337_2239.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:03:27.094333

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have muted this year’s autumn colors, and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual. Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of the mid-south and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red. But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because it causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly.

GM to take a $1.6 billion hit as tax incentives for EVs are slashed and emission rules ease

General Motors will book a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed. Shares dipped 3% before the opening bell Tuesday. The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones. General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, warned that more hits may be ahead as it adjust production under a new administration, and non-cash charges may impact operations and cash flow in the future.

Brewers turn potential grand slam by Dodgers slugger Max Muncy into wild double play in NLCS

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Max Muncy came within inches of hitting a grand slam for the Los Angeles Dodgers to open the scoring in the National League Championship Series. Instead, the Milwaukee Brewers turned it into one of the most incredible double plays in postseason history. With the bases loaded and one out in the fourth inning, Muncy hit a long drive to center field. Sal Frelick jumped and reached over the wall in an attempt to make the catch. The ball popped out of Frelick’s glove and hit the top of the fence before Frelick caught it in the air. He fired the ball in, and Brewers catcher William Contreras forced out one runner at home plate and another at third base for a most unusual 8-6-2 inning-ending double play.

This Virginia nonprofit is finding out. - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/agrivoltaics-crops-virginia-pilot-loudoun,"Virginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland.

With the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature?
What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react?
But a 2024 survey from the American Farmland Trust found that most Virginia farmers and farmland owners hold nuanced views.","More than a decade ago, residents of Loudoun County, Virginia, banded together to buy up treasured open space before it became a strip mall and housing development, donating the land to the Piedmont Environmental Council instead. The nonprofit has maintained it as a unique blend of cattle pasture, a nature preserve, and a community farm that donates its yield to a local food pantry.

Now, a small corner of the farm has become what organizers say is a first for the state: a crop-based agrivoltaics demonstration project. They hope the combination of solar panels and vegetable farming will showcase how much-needed renewable energy can complement, not harm, agricultural lands, at a time when data centers are demanding more and more electricity.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, to stop burning fossil fuels by 2045 and to develop 16,100 megawatts of land-based renewable energy by 2035 — mostly in the form of solar.

Virginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland. Using a conservative metric that 10 acres of land can host 1 megawatt of solar capacity, a Nature Conservancy analysis found that the state has 40 times more suitable land area than needed for solar fields, even after ruling out over 2 million acres of ​“prime conservation lands” including farmland.

Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University determined that large-scale solar today is erected on less than 1% of the state’s cropland. Under a ​“high-growth scenario,” that figure could rise to 3.1% by 2035, including 1.2% of the state’s federally designated prime farmland. Yet low-density residential development may pose a far greater threat to those spaces, according to research by the nonprofit American Farmland Trust, which advocates for ​“smart solar” that doesn’t jeopardize agricultural land.

In fact, many landowners find that renting a portion of their land to solar companies can help their farming enterprise pencil out financially, reducing pressure to sell their property to developers. An acre of land, after all, may yield hundreds of dollars if devoted to crops but thousands if leased for panels.

And yet there’s no doubt that solar has grown exponentially in the state in the last decade, and that it has disproportionately displaced farmland. Cropland makes up 5% of Virginia’s total acreage but 28% of the land area now used for large-scale solar, the Virginia Commonwealth University researchers found.

Especially in the early years of renewable-energy construction, some companies set a poor example for responsible development, said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council. ​“It was a little bit ​‘Wild West,’” he said. ​“Those early projects in 2018, 2019 — there were a lot of significant runoff issues.”

As solar fields have gone up at a breakneck pace — replacing plots of forests as well as farmland — opposition to them has also grown. Virginia localities approved 100% of solar projects in 2016, according to reporting from Inside Climate News. By 2024, the approval rate had fallen to under 50%.

The increasing number of rejections stems from a ​“a mix of disinformation and resentment,” Kapoor said. But the tension between solar and farmland is real. ​“That’s a national thing,” he added. ​“It’s everywhere.”

Agrivoltaics — the awkward portmanteau of agriculture and solar photovoltaics — has emerged as a potential solution, wherein farmland is kept in production even while it hosts solar arrays. The most common application is sheep: They graze on vegetation beneath the panels and prevent the need for expensive and polluting mowers. Planting flowers in and around panels to supply honeybees and other pollinators is also popular.

Still, the Piedmont Environmental Council team wanted to experiment with a crop-based model because it fits better with what most farmers in the area are doing now: raising vegetables.

“You want to change as little as possible for the farmer,” said Teddy Pitsiokos, who manages the organization’s community farm.

Occupying a quarter-acre section of the nonprofit’s 8-acre community vegetable farm in Loudoun County, the agrivoltaics project is small by design. It features 42 ground-mounted solar panels with a total capacity of 17 kilowatts, two batteries for backup power during outages, and about 2,000 square feet of growing area.

The array will supply more than enough power to meet the farm’s needs, with additional headroom for a planned EV charger and a greenhouse that organizers want to electrify eventually. But the Piedmont Environmental Council isn’t trying to demonstrate scale. Rather, it hopes to carefully measure impact.

With the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature? What’s the resulting crop yield? What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react? Do any contents from the panels make their way into the crops, posing health problems?

Most research has found that the answer to the last question is no. But the team still plans to test for contaminants in response to public concern as a show of good faith and transparency, and in an effort to address any potential barriers to agrivoltaics from the get-go.

While most crop-based agrivoltaics projects involve growing produce in the ground, the Piedmont Environmental Council’s farm also includes raised beds, which enable educational tours and widen the demonstration project’s relevance.

The beds do increase costs, said Pitsiokos. But the rationale for them, he said, ​“is so we can create data for people who might be doing this in an urban setting, a parking lot, or on some other nonpermeable surface,” he said. ​“We have productive agricultural soil; not everybody does.”

The experiment could also help inform compliance with new state rules designed to mitigate land loss from solar: Certain developers have to conserve land on a one-to-one basis for projects on prime farmland, but their burden is less if the array is used for agrivoltaics.

Pitsiokos also wants the data to reach educators, policymakers, and cohorts he hasn’t anticipated yet. ​“We want to share it with everybody,” he said, ​“because we know that we can’t predict who might benefit from it exactly.”

Perhaps most of all, the Piedmont Environmental Council hopes the project will reach farmers. Plenty are outspoken on solar, both for and against. But a 2024 survey from the American Farmland Trust found that most Virginia farmers and farmland owners hold nuanced views. Over half would consider solar if they could continue farming under and around the panels, according to the survey, but nearly two-thirds agree that solar developers should be responsible for returning land to a farmable state after an array is decommissioned.

With the project’s first crops of kale getting harvested this month, the Piedmont Environmental Council plans to make real-time data available as soon as this winter, for all to see.

News item from the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy","SEIA and the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy have announced a new initiative called “Pathways to Trust: A Learning Journey Toward Equitable Tribal Partnerships.” In observance of Indigenous Peoples’ Day, the launch turns recognition into practice, providing step-by-step tools for respectful, mutually beneficial work with sovereign Tribal Nations.

Working with sovereign Tribal Nations requires a high level of cultural awareness and understanding of complex legal and governance frameworks. Pathways to Trust addresses common knowledge gaps that often undermine cross-cultural collaboration and equips participants with practical tools to build mutually beneficial partnerships. The curriculum represents the first comprehensive training of its kind created by Indigenous experts specifically for the energy industry and beyond.

“The energy transition requires trustworthy allies to Tribal Nations,” said Chéri Smith, founder, president and CEO of the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy. “Every Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we’re asked, ‘What can we do to support Tribes?’ After two years in development, we’re so excited to expand our partnership with SEIA to offer Pathways to Trust as a concrete way for the clean energy industry to act — by building cultural fluency, applying practical tools, engaging respectfully, avoiding harm, and co-creating successful projects with sovereign Tribal Nations.”

The curriculum consists of five interconnected modules — Legal & Political Literacy, Historical Awareness, Cultural Competency and Partnership Skills. Pathways to Trust ensures sovereignty isn’t an afterthought in clean energy development — supporting professionals to work alongside Tribal Nations as governmental partners and rights-holders, and to center sovereignty at every stage of a project, from first outreach through operations.

The online curriculum is now available on SEIA’s learning platform. The full program is also available for in-person, instructor-led delivery.

“The Solar Energy Industries Association is honored to partner with the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy to support the development of equitable and effective partnerships with sovereign Tribal Nations,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “We believe in the promise of clean energy for all people and the success we can have together when we put in the work to build deep understanding and respect for Tribal sovereignty, governance, history and contemporary realities. Pathways to Trust was designed with these principles in mind, and we’re looking forward to the progress we can achieve together with trust and respect as the foundation.”

The program is designed for clean energy developers and service providers, federal and state government employees, legal professionals and consultants, project managers, community liaisons and non-profit organizations working with or serving Tribal communities.

Pathways to Trust serves as the foundational requirement for the Alliance’s Preferred Provider Program, which connects Tribal Nations with vetted clean energy service providers. Companies and individuals that complete the training become eligible for inclusion in the Alliance’s Preferred Provider Directory, creating a trusted network of culturally competent partners for Tribal clean energy projects.

By centering Indigenous expertise and providing actionable frameworks, Pathways to Trust supports more effective collaboration, reduces project risks, creates better outcomes for all parties and contributes to the broader goal of equitable relationships between Tribal Nations and external partners.

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the vehicles accounted for 29.1% of all light-duty vehicle sales in the state during the third quarter of this year. The California Energy Commission said registrations came to 124,755 between July and September, breaking the previous quarterly sales record of 118,776 zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs, set in the second quarter of 2023.

“This is unprecedented — we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth-largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” Newsom in a news release.

“I’m not surprised,” said Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds.com. “If there were any a time in which we would see a record for this vehicle type selling, now makes the most sense.”

The sales figures come on the heels of the 940-page federal budget legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill and signed into law in July by President Donald Trump. The package included provisions that eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 on the purchase or lease of a new EV, or $4,000 for a used one, as of Sept. 30.

Earlier this month, makers of electric vehicles reported boosts in third-quarter sales, as consumers across the country jumped in before the tax credits went away. Rivian, for example, reported a surge of nearly 32% between July and September, and Tesla — the popular maker of EVs in the U.S. — saw a 7% bump in deliveries.

The big question centers on whether the momentum will hold up in succeeding quarters, especially considering California’s aggressive electric vehicle targets and headwinds from the Trump administration.

Five years ago, Newsom issued an executive order mandating the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout California by 2035. But in June, Trump signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions rescinding California’s electric vehicle mandates — as well as rules related to diesel engines.

California and 10 other states have responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress.

“While the federal government stumbles backward with reckless rollbacks and short-sighted policies, California charges ahead lighting the path to a cleaner, more prosperous future,” California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez said Monday.

Policymakers said the number of publicly available charging stations across the state now exceeds 200,000 and that California just became the first state in the country to adopt standards to improve reliability and enable accurate reporting of EV chargers in operation across the state.

The California Energy Commission in August launched a $55 million incentive program that would subsidize up to 100% of the installation costs for fast-charging stations at businesses and public sites.

It’s all part of the state’s efforts to reduce “range anxiety” — the fear that drivers could get stranded if their EV runs out of power before getting to a charging station — and encourage potential customers to go all-in on ZEVs.

Nationally, electric vehicles make up about 10% to 12% of national auto sales.

Speaking at a conference two weeks ago, Ford CEO Jim Farley said, “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%,” adding that while the zero-emission sector will remain a “vibrant industry” going forward, it’s also “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.”

Drury of Edmunds.com said automakers “have an existing consumer base now that has a preference for EVs and because of that they’ll move forward. Combine that with the fact that every automaker is global and EVs aren’t going away anytime soon.”

But with the tax credit gone, Drury expects October sales “should be down a bit,” adding that “the jury’s still out” on whether California can hit its 2035 goals.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SUT-L-ELECTRICVEHICLES-HYUNDAI-0814-01.jpg?w=1024&h=501,N,,2025-10-14 11:00:46.011884

According to the report, the projected peak demand increase is so significant that it could exceed available supply in the short term.

Brattle says that battery storage can help address this resource inadequacy.

The study assumes that all forecasted demand in PJM’2 2025 Load Forecast Report will materialise, meaning that by 2028, PJM’s summer peak will increase by 16GW, and by 2032, by an additional 30GW.

Interconnection queue backlogs, long wait times for new supply—particularly gas-fired generation, and trade barriers for renewables and storage are expected to constrain PJM’s supply well into the early 2030s.

While efforts have been taken to increase available near-term capacity, PJM’s interconnection process still imposes a multi-year study wait-time.

The report assumes that by 2032, at most, an additional 10GW+ of new gas facilities would be in service.

The report models the PJM system through 2045, using current load growth and cost forecasts, to determine the most cost-effective future resource mix for the region. It then assesses the impact on resource adequacy for PJM by analysing a hypothetical case where battery storage is not an available resource option.

Brattle’s study projects that significant amounts of dispatchable resources, such as storage and gas, will be essential for ensuring resource adequacy and handling weather-related risks in PJM.

The role of energy storage

PJM will require 16 to 23GW of battery storage within the next 7 to 15 years.

This assumes that the market can incorporate more than 17GW of new gas resources by 2032 and postpones nearly all planned thermal retirements to the middle of the next decade.

Battery storage becomes even more essential as the slower deployment of gas resources worsens resource adequacy challenges.

Despite price pressures caused by trade barrier uncertainties, substantial storage remains in PJM’s interconnection queue. This could help compensate if the required firm gas capacity is not developed in time to support large loads by the end of the decade.

Brattle also highlights that storage facilities can be brought into service much faster than gas turbines, due to supply rebalances and backlogged demand.

With battery storage, PJM could prevent up to 15GW of load shedding risk during difficult system conditions in 2032, like extreme cold snaps. Without this, load shedding could lead to planning failures, serious customer impacts, and an unreliable system.

The report states that PJM will need to continue utilising new gas resources and maintaining conventional firm resources through the 2040s; battery storage will help reliably meet the increasing demand in the coming decades.

Notably, Brattle also projects that customer costs could increase by 30% without energy storage deployment.

In July, advocacy organisations Citizens Utility Board (CUB) and Clean Grid Alliance stated that increasing the use of renewable energy and battery storage in Illinois could help reduce the rising costs of capacity market auctions within the PJM Interconnection area.

The prices were 22% higher than in 2024’s auction for capacity in the 2025-2026 delivery year.

In April, Brattle and the American Clean Power Association (ACP) released a report on energy storage market reforms for regional grid operators, including PJM.

Brattle indicated that although storage can engage in PJM’s capacity, energy, and ancillary services markets, outdated regulations prevent it from competing on an equal footing.

The current rules are tailored for traditional generation assets and do not consider the opportunity cost of using energy or saving it for a more valuable time.

(Reuters) -General Motors said on Tuesday it would take a $1.6 billion charge in the third quarter as it reshapes its electric vehicle strategy following the scrapping of a key federal incentive that is likely to dampen demand.

GM's disclosure is one of the clearest indications yet that U.S. automakers are scrambling to adapt their production plans in response to slowing EV demand.

The EV market also faces fresh strain after the Trump administration scrapped a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, a key industry support, with auto executives warning of a sharp near-term drop in battery-car sales before an eventual rebound.

EV ADOPTION RATE TO SLOW

In a filing, GM said it expects ""the adoption rate of EVs to slow"" following recent policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and reduced emissions-rule stringency.

""The charge is a special item driven by our expectation that EV volumes will be lower than planned because of market conditions and the changed regulatory and policy environment,"" GM told Reuters in a statement.

Automakers are also working to cushion the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which forced GM to take a $1.1 billion hit in the previous quarter.

The company has estimated a bottom-line impact of $4 billion to $5 billion this year from trade headwinds and said it could take steps to offset at least 30% of the blow.

Shares of the Detroit, Michigan-based automaker were down 2.5% in premarket trading. The stock is up about 4.5% so far this year.

""The charge doesn’t come as a surprise given recent market developments and the fact GM had made probably the most aggressive EV push of any traditional automaker,"" said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.

""We think the automakers who chose to invest more heavily in hybrid vehicle development such as Toyota and Honda are poised to benefit in the U.S. auto market.""

Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans.

The automaker warned of possible further charges as it reassesses capacity and manufacturing footprint.

The changes will, however, not affect GM's current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs that are in production.

Charges include a $1.2 billion non-cash impairment tied to EV capacity adjustments and $400 million for contract-cancellation fees and commercial settlements.

GM said the charges will be recorded as adjustments to non-GAAP results for the third quarter, scheduled for early next week.

Zevo Will Deploy Faraday Future’s Next-generation Automobiles Across World’s First Peer-to-peer EV Sharing Marketplace

This partnership further validates our mission — to make EV access and ownership attainable for more people.”

— Hebron Sher, Co-founder and CEO of Zevo

DALLAS, TX, UNITED STATES, October 14, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Zevo, the world’s first peer-to-peer EV sharing platform, today announced it has signed a strategic partnership with Faraday Future (NASDAQ: FFIE) to bring 1,000 of the automaker’s next-generation electric vehicles, FX Super One, onto its network. The agreement establishes Zevo as a co-creation partner and represents one of the largest real-world fleet EV allocations by a peer-to-peer network. The development also helps diversify Zevo’s fleet mix — reducing dependency on Tesla models — and marks a major milestone in making advanced EVs more accessible to communities nationwide.

Under the partnership, Zevo plans to make the majority of the vehicles available through its community of independent hosts, providing drivers the opportunity to access the cars immediately and, over time, transition toward ownership. The model builds on Zevo’s mission to create alternatives to high-cost rental programs by aligning vehicle access with long-term equity for the people who power the platform. The remainder will be operated directly by Zevo in select test markets.

“This partnership further validates our mission — to make EV access and ownership attainable for more people,” said Hebron Sher, Co-founder and CEO of Zevo. “By working with Faraday Future, we’re not just putting more EVs on the road. We’re creating a fairer model where drivers can earn, drive and ultimately work toward owning the vehicles they rely on.”

“Partnering with Zevo puts FF Super One into real-world service immediately,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “High-mileage use across diverse driving conditions gives us market penetration, visibility, feedback and customer familiarity — everything you want in an effective go-to-market strategy.”

With Zevo cars averaging more than 5,000 miles driven per month, the partnership ensures Faraday Future’s vehicles will see significant real-world use while empowering drivers to earn income through the platform. For many, consistent use of Zevo can also open the door to financing opportunities and longer-term ownership — an alternative to high-cost rental or subscription models that often leave drivers without equity.

The first vehicles are expected to be delivered over the next 12–18 months, with deployment beginning in key Zevo markets including Texas, California, Arizona, Florida and Nevada.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) addressed in a September 11th Order a Petition for Objection to a Title V Operating Permit for the Neville Chemical Company filed by Environmental Integrity Project and three other organizations. See Petition No. III-2024-22.

The other three organizations joining the Petition included:

Clean Air Council

PennFuture

Food & Water Watch

(Collectively, “EIP”).

The September 11th Order is styled:

ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART A PETITION FOR OBJECTION TO A TITLE V OPERATING PERMIT (“Order”).

Neville is stated to operate a manufacturing facility in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania that manufactures:

Synthetic hydrocarbon resins

Plasticizers.

Plasticizing oils (used in coatings, adhesives, ink, roofing, and rubber).

Title V of the Clean Air Act requires certain stationary sources of air pollution to obtain Operating Permits. States that administer Title V do so through adopted implementation plans. Those plans are submitted to and approved by EPA.

The intent of a Title V Permit is to organize into a single document all of the requirements that apply to the Permit holder. 42 U.S.C. § 7661 requires that states submit each proposed Title V Permit to EPA for review. Section 505(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act requires that EPA object to the issuance of a proposed Title V Permit in writing within 45 days of the receipt of the proposed Permit (and all necessary supporting information) if the agency determines it is not in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.

If EPA does not object to a Permit, Section 505(b)(2) provides that any person may petition the EPA Administrator within 60 days of the expiration of the 45-day review period to object to the Permit.

EIP’s section of the Petition titled “Grounds for Objection” includes four claims addressing the Title V Renewal Permit. The claims include:

Claim 1. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for PM, NOx, SOx, CO, VOC, and HAPs from P001 (heat polymerization stills and thermal oxidizer).”

EPA grants in part and denies in part this claim and objects to the issuance of the permit. EPA rejects EIP’s challenge to the temperature monitoring methodology which argues that the Allegheny County Health Department (“ACHD”) should rely exclusively on temperature as an indicator of performance. In contrast, the Title V Permit for PM and SOx is held by EPA to not add additional conditions to assure compliance with such limits (e.g., through fuel use monitoring and emission calculations based on emission factors. EPA requests that ACHD amend the Permit to ensure that it contains sufficient requirements to assure compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for PM and SOx on the thermal oxidizer.

Claim 2. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for PM, CO, VOCs, SOx, and NOx at Boilers No. 6 and 8 (B013 and B012 respectively).”

EPA grants this Petition claim and objects to the issuance of the Permit. The federal agency references the testing and monitoring requirements in the Permit, but states it is not clear if any of these methods are individually or collectively adequate to assure compliance with the emission limits. ACHD is directed to amend the Permit and and permit record as necessary to ensure that the Permit assures compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for the referenced air pollutants from Boiler No. 6 and Boiler No. 8.

Claim 3. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for PM, NOx, CO, VOCs, HAPs, and SOx at the six Still Process Heaters (B001, B002, B003, B004, B015, and B006) and the three Packaging Center Heaters (B009, B010, and B011).”

EPA grants this Petition claim and objects to the issuance of the Permit and states that EIP demonstrated that the Permit fails to require adequate monitoring to assure compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for the referenced air pollutants from the heaters. Further, ACHD’s Permit record is stated to not provide a rationale for the Permit’s lack of monitoring requirements. ACHD is directed to amend the Permit to ensure that the Permit contains sufficient requirements to assure compliance with the hourly and annual emission limits for the referenced air pollutants from the six still process heaters and three packaging center heaters.

Claim 4. The Petitioners Claim That “The Renewal Permit fails to include adequate testing, monitoring, or reporting requirements sufficient to assure continuous compliance with the hourly and long-term emission limits for VOCs and HAPs at Unit 20/21 (P006) and the #3 Continuous Still (P008).”

EPA denies EIP’s request for an objection on this claim. EPA notes that EIP is correct that neither the Permit nor the RTC explain the relationship between the parameters and emissions or how to calculate emissions using the recorded parameters. However, the Neville facility’s TSD is stated to do so. Referenced are tables describing operating scenarios, operating parameters, heat-up parameters, equations, and example scenarios as well as sample calculations for VOC and HAP emissions for each emission unit.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:12:33.315888

The EV tax credit ended last month.
The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.
In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next.","General Motors will record a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment.
Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.
We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies.
Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.","How much pollution a facility engaged in production or resource extraction emits isn’t just based on its location, its industry or the type of work it does. That’s what our team of environmental and financial economists found when we examined how corporate characteristics shape pollution emissions.

Pollution emissions rates also vary with specific characteristics of the company that owns the facility – such as how many patents it holds, how profitable it is and how many employees it has, according to an analysis we have conducted of corporate pollution data.

We found that industrial and mining facilities owned by profitable companies with relatively few patents and fewer employees tend to release higher proportions of their toxic waste into the environment – into the air, into water or onto soil.

By contrast, industrial sites owned by unprofitable companies with higher levels of innovation and more personnel tend to handle higher proportions of their toxic waste in more environmentally responsible ways, such as processing them into nontoxic forms or recycling them, or burning them to generate energy.

Corporations publish their pollution data

A 1986 federal law requires companies that are in certain industries, employ more than 10 people and make, use or process significant amounts of certain toxic or dangerous chemicals to tell the government where those chemicals go after the company is done with them.

That data is collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a database called the Toxics Release Inventory. That data includes information about the companies, their facilities and locations, and what they do with their waste chemicals.

The goal is not only to inform the public about which dangerous chemicals are being used in their communities, but also to encourage companies to use cleaner methods and handle their waste in ways that are more environmentally responsible.

Overall, U.S. companies reported releasing to the environment 3.3 billion pounds of toxic chemicals (1.5 billion kg) in 2023, a 21% decrease from 2014. The decline reflects increased waste management, adoption of pollution prevention and cleaner technologies, in addition to the fact that disclosure requirements motivate companies to reduce releases.

The 2023 releases came from over 21,600 industrial facilities in all 50 states and various U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. One-fifth of the facilities reporting toxic releases in 2023 were in Texas, Ohio and California.

What kinds of businesses release toxic pollution?

Metal mining, chemical manufacturing, primary metals, natural gas processing and electric utilities represent the top five polluting industrial sectors in the U.S. Combined, businesses in those sectors accounted for 78% of the toxic chemicals released in 2023.

Research has found that, often, higher levels of toxic chemical releases come from industrial facilities in less populated, economically disadvantaged, rural or minority communities.

But geography and population are not the whole story. Even within the same area, some facilities pollute a lot less than others. Our inquiry into the differences between those facilities has found that corporate characteristics matter a lot – such as operational size, innovative capacity and financial strength.

In our analysis, we combined the data companies reported to the EPA about toxic chemical releases with financial information on those companies and ZIP-code level geographic and demographic data. We found that corporate characteristics like profitability, employment size and number of patents are more strongly connected with toxic chemical releases than a community’s population density, minority-group percentage or household income.

We looked at what percentage of its toxic chemical waste a facility or mine released to the environment versus how much it treated, recycled or incinerated.

The average facility in our sample, which included 1,976 facilities owned by companies for which financial data is available, released about 39% of its toxic chemical waste to the environment, whether to air, water or land – with the remaining 61% of it managed through recycling, treatment or energy recovery either on-site or off-site.

But facilities in different industries have different release rates. For example, about 99% of toxic chemicals from coal mines are released to the environment, compared with 81% for natural gas extraction, recovery and processing; 25% for power-generating electric utilities; and less than 3% for electrical equipment manufacturers.

The role of innovation

One corporate attribute we examined was innovation, which we measured by counting corporations’ patent families, which are groups of patent documents related to the same invention, even if they are filed in different countries. We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment.

Specifically, facilities owned by the top 25% of companies, when rated by innovation, released an average of 32.5% of their toxic waste to the environment, which is 8 percentage points lower than the average of facilities owned by the remaining companies in the sample.

We hypothesize that innovation may give firms a competitive advantage that also enables them to adopt cleaner production technologies or invest in more environmentally conscious methods of handling waste containing toxic chemicals, thereby preventing toxic chemicals from being directly released to the environment.

Size and profitability matter, too

We also looked at companies’ size – in terms of number of employees – and their profitability, to see how those connected with pollution rates at the facilities the company owns.

We found that larger companies, those with more than 19,000 employees, own facilities that release an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. By contrast, facilities owned by midsized companies, from 1,000 to 19,000 workers, release 45%, on average. Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment.

An important note is that those larger companies, which are more likely to have multiple locations, often own facilities that handle larger volumes of chemicals. So even if they release smaller proportions of their toxic waste to the environment, that may still add up to larger quantities.

We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies.

Facilities owned by companies with positive net income, according to their income statements obtained from PitchBook, a company that collects data on corporations, released an average of 40% of their toxic-chemical-containing wastes to the environment. Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. To us, that indicates that financially strong companies are not necessarily more environmentally responsible. That may be evidence that profitable firms make money in part by contaminating the environment rather than paying for pollution prevention or cleanup.

Our analysis shows that geography and demographics alone do not fully account for industries’ and facilities’ differing levels of pollution. Corporate characteristics are also key factors in how toxic waste is handled and disposed of.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/695222/original/file-20251008-64-dvv70r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C500%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-14 12:12:38.006564

Non-cash impairment and other charges totaling $1.2 billion are the result of adjustments to EV capacity, GM said Tuesday in a regulatory filing. The rest of the costs relate to canceling contracts and settling commercial arrangements linked to EV investments and will have a cash impact.

GM warned the reassessment of its EV manufacturing footprint is ongoing and that it’s “reasonably possible” it will recognize more charges that hurt its results in quarters to come. The automaker’s shares fell 3.3% before the start of regular trading in New York.

Automakers have been recalibrating their EV investment and production plans as President Donald Trump’s policies inject volatility into the US car market. The administration eliminated EV tax credits at the end of last month and has effectively nullified fuel economy and emissions standards, enticing companies to sell more profitable gasoline-powered vehicles and make fewer EVs.

“Following recent US government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

GM’s stock rose 4.4% this year through Monday’s close, trailing the 13% advance in the S&P 500 Index.

GM announced last month it would relaunch the Chevrolet Bolt EV in December with one shift of production at its plant in Kansas, a reduction from its earlier plan for two shifts. The company also has scheduled downtime in December at a Tennessee factory where it builds the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq EVs, and will cut output to one shift from January through May.

The automaker said at the time that it was “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

The moves echo those of rival Ford Motor Co., which has delayed or scrapped some plug-in models and reallocated dollars away from its money-losing EV business. The automaker took a $1.9 billion hit last year linked to canceling plans for an electric sport utility vehicle.

Since then, the outlook for EVs has grown even more uncertain. Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said last month that the EV market will be “way smaller than we thought” as Trump’s policies push consumers toward gas-powered vehicles.

The pullback comes despite a recent jump in EV sales, driven in part by consumers rushing to take advantage of tax credits before they expired. GM’s third-quarter US sales rose 8%, led by electric vehicle deliveries that doubled to more than 66,000 cars and trucks.

And while previous controls on rare earths focused primarily on materials, the latest restrictions also cover components such as magnets, and equipment for recycling.
Under successive administrations, the US has been taking measures to develop alternative sources of supply for rare earths and battery materials.
The same is true of many other critical minerals: lithium, for example.
“China has been working consistently on these critical minerals for many decades,” says Julian Kettle, Wood Mackenzie’s Vice-Chairman of Metals and Mining.","China recognised the strategic importance of its rare earths industry back in the early 1990s. Deng Xiaoping, the former leader, said in 1992: “The Middle East has its oil, China has rare earths… it is of extremely important strategic significance.” That strategic vision is still paying off today.

In an escalation of the trade dispute between China and the US, Beijing last week moved to tighten export controls for rare earths and other critical minerals and technologies, particularly for batteries. Its dominance of global supply chains for those materials means that its moves could have far-reaching impacts on industries including defence and semiconductors, as well as battery storage and electric vehicles.

The package of measures includes new controls on five rare earth elements that are crucial in medical and telecoms applications, as well as some military uses. And while previous controls on rare earths focused primarily on materials, the latest restrictions also cover components such as magnets, and equipment for recycling.

The battery-related controls are even more wide-ranging, covering cathode and anode materials, high-performance components, and manufacturing equipment.

President Donald Trump responded swiftly, saying the US would impose additional tariffs of 100% on all imports from China on 1 November. Over the weekend, however, he stepped back from that confrontational stance, posting: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!... The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” Stock markets, which had fallen sharply on Friday, rebounded on Monday.

Under successive administrations, the US has been taking measures to develop alternative sources of supply for rare earths and battery materials. Chris Wright, the energy secretary, in August announced nearly US$1 billion of funding opportunities for projects to develop and scale up mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies for critical minerals.

The Department of Defense has also been stepping up its purchases of critical minerals, with recent orders worth a total of more than US$1 billion for cobalt, antimony, tantalum and scandium, among other materials.

Some moves to secure US domestic supplies are already under way. The Department of Defense in July agreed a deal to support MP Materials, which owns the Mountain Pass rare earths mine in California, processing facilities, and manufacturing plants for metals and magnets.

The US government made investments that would make it the company’s largest shareholder, agreed to buy all the magnets produced at MP’s new factory for at least ten years, and set a guaranteed price floor for its rare earth products.

The Trump administration also took 5% stakes in Lithium Americas and in the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada that the company is developing in a joint venture with General Motors.

The private sector has also been stepping up. JPMorgan on Monday launched what it described as a US$1.5 trillion security and resiliency initiative: a 10-year plan to facilitate, finance and invest in key strategic industries, including critical minerals.

China’s latest moves have been widely seen as a negotiating tactic, intended to create leverage before President Trump meets President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea at the end of October. If a deal can be done there, the new restrictions may be lifted quickly.

Scott Bessent, the US Treasury secretary, said on Monday that there had been substantial communication between the two countries over the weekend, and the US had “de-escalated” the situation.

However, he suggested that the dispute underlined the importance of reducing US dependence on China.

“We don’t want to decouple. But China, when they send out messages like this, this is a decoupling message,” he said.

The Wood Mackenzie view

The first thing everyone learns about rare earths is that they are not actually particularly rare, in terms of their distribution of deposits around the world. The same is true of many other critical minerals: lithium, for example. But that does not mean that diversifying away from Chinese supplies will be easy.

China dominates global supply chains for these materials not because it holds the largest resource base for primary supplies, but because it has invested in technologies and capacity to process, refine and use them.

“China has been working consistently on these critical minerals for many decades,” says Julian Kettle, Wood Mackenzie’s Vice-Chairman of Metals and Mining. “The industry had a lot of failures, but they learned from them. They kept trying and trying again.”

In the US and other developed economies, minerals processing capacity has been lost and knowhow dispersed when companies were hit by downturns in the market. In China, these sectors have benefitted from consistent government support.

In the developed world, environmental regulations and community opposition have made it difficult and expensive to expand operations. In China, environmental regulations have still allowed industries to grow.

Creating the right economic, political and social framework to allow critical minerals companies to invest and expand in developed countries will take time and money. The US deal with MP Materials is a step in the right direction, but more will be needed to develop complete supply chains in all the relevant sectors.

Perhaps the toughest point for other countries to accept is that China has much of the world’s best technology and capabilities for materials processing. “It’s quite a sobering moment for the West to have to go to China to say: ‘can you show us how to it?’ But in many sectors that’s the reality,” says Wood Mackenzie’s Kettle.

“If other countries want best-in-class technology, they are going to have to work with Chinese companies.”

However, the Trump administration and other US politicians are generally deeply sceptical about partnerships between American and Chinese companies. Japanese and South Korean companies also have materials processing capabilities, but have faced challenges with investment in the US.

If China’s latest export restrictions are maintained, they will also make it harder to build alternative supply chains in other countries. The details vary from product to product, but in general, delayed approvals for equipment exports will slow the commissioning of non-Chinese plants.

Secretary Bessent says the US drive to establish its own critical minerals industry is “the equivalent of Operation Warp Speed”: the first Trump administration’s highly successful programme to develop vaccines for Covid-19.

The US is unlikely to be able to establish full supply chains for rare earths and battery raw materials that quickly. But unless it and other countries start to make the effort, critical minerals will continue to represent important strategic leverage for China.

The Trump administration has blocked what would have been the largest solar development in North America: the 6.2 gigawatt Esmeralda Seven project in Nevada. A statement on the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) website described the project, which would have covered about 62,300 acres, as “cancelled”. However, there are signs that one or more of the project’s seven phases could still go ahead.

The Department of the Interior said in a statement that the developers, which include NextEra and Invenergy, could still “submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyse potential impacts” of individual phases.

The BLM suggested that it could “consider authorising an amendment” to the resource management plan for the area to allow solar installations. It added that the Environmental Impact Statement for the plan should “further analyse generally the expected impacts [from the project] and develop required future mitigation.”

NextEra said it remained “committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management.”

In brief

Oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels since May, on fears that the flare-up in trade tensions between China and the US could hit global growth. Brent crude was trading at about US$63.40 a barrel on Monday night.

Ming Yang of China plans to invest £1.5bn in Scotland to build the UK’s largest wind turbine manufacturing plant. The company’s UK chief executive said it aimed to “make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.”

Quote of the week

“These data centers should be outfitted with power generation capabilities, whether it’s natural gas or in the future – several years from now – nuclear. We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy. And then even put it back onto the grid. And so that’s the future. And data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid.”

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, talked in an interview on CNBC about the importance of data centres having behind-the-meter power, to accelerate deployment and stop driving up electricity bills for other customers.

Chart of the week

This comes from our recent note titled US shale gas is back, by Ryan Duman and Lydia Walker. It makes a very simple point: through the 2010s, rising natural gas supply in the US was associated with a declining trend in prices. But now, from the second half of the 2020s, it seems likely that rising supply will be associated with rising prices.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/metals-and-mining/_micro/micro_metalsandmining_thinkstockphotos-180698844.jpg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-10-14 12:11:43.442253

Any executive order issued by one president can be undone by an executive order signed by his successor, as Trump has repeatedly done for Joe Biden.
But they all serve one purpose: to expand the powers of the president and weaken the powers of Congress.","Sometimes the title of a book says it all. And that’s the case with a just-released collection of essays by the late, great David McCullough: “History Matters.”

In the book’s first two sentences, McCullough tells us why: “History tells us how to behave. History teaches, reinforces what we believe in, what we stand for, and what we ought to be willing to stand up for.” Making no effort to understand our history, McCullough adds, “isn’t just ignorant, it’s rude. It’s a form of ingratitude.”

But one thing about history: those who are living through historic times aren’t necessarily aware of it. In the last century, Americans who made the transition from a manufacturing economy to a service economy didn’t decide to make history. They just needed jobs, and they went where the new jobs were.

By the same measure, most Americans today don’t realize that we’re witnessing an historic change in governance: the disappearance of the U.S. Congress as a meaningful and essential institution. It didn’t happen overnight, but we are getting close to the point where Congress doesn’t matter anymore.

Seriously, when was the last time you remember Congress passing any significant legislation? Monumental achievements like Medicare, the Clean Air Act, the Voting Rights Act, or the Civil Rights Act, aren’t possible anymore. This 119th Congress, like the last few sessions, is incapable of probing, debating, and resolving such weighty issues. It can’t even manage its most basic job of keeping the government running.

Sadly, history will show that nobody seized Congress or stole away its authority. Its wounds are self-inflicted. Through laziness, lack of courage, or sheer party loyalty over what’s best for the nation, members of Congress gradually ceded their powers, starting with the power to declare war.

The Constitution is clear: Under Article 1, Section 8, only Congress has the power to declare war. Yet Congress has not exercised that power since World War II. In 1950, President Harry Truman bypassed Congress and ordered U.S. military intervention on the Korean peninsula. Since then, every American war — Vietnam, Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Iraq — has been launched by a president. Congress has ceded its war-making power to the president and is unlikely ever to get it back.

This year, Congress made another huge concession, voluntarily surrendering what is perhaps its most-prized responsibility: control of federal spending. Again, the Constitution is clear. Only Congress has the power of the purse. A president cannot refuse to spend money already appropriated by Congress — unless it cedes that power to the president, which it has.

In July, the Republican-controlled House and Senate voted to let President Trump rescind $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting already approved by Congress. Even though $9 billion is just a small slice of the overall federal budget, Forbes magazine called it a “tectonic shift” in the balance of powers and one that Congress may soon regret. Because, again, once having ceded ultimate power over spending to the White House, they may never get it back.

But, as historian Douglas Brinkley recently revealed in a speech to the White House Historical Association, it is by issuing executive orders that presidents have most persistently eroded the power of the legislative branch. It is a practice used by every president since George Washington for some of the most important measures ever taken by the U.S.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln, not an act of Congress. President Teddy Roosevelt used an executive order to save the Grand Canyon and create 150 national forests. President Franklin Roosevelt used it to shape the New Deal, launch the Manhattan Project and force the internment of Japanese-Americans. Truman used it to desegregate the Armed Forces. President Kennedy used it to create the Peace Corps.

President Trump, of course, is especially fond of executive orders. He signed 26 on his first day in office alone and continues to sign more of them, with flourish, almost every day. But, with a total of 209 signed as of Oct. 9, he has a long way to go to beat the 3,721 signed by FDR.

Executive orders have one fatal flaw: They’re not permanent. Any executive order issued by one president can be undone by an executive order signed by his successor, as Trump has repeatedly done for Joe Biden. But they all serve one purpose: to expand the powers of the president and weaken the powers of Congress.

So much for the balance of powers designed by James Madison. Who needs Congress anymore?",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP25283800029173.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:50.173814

Partisan rancor endures after Republicans enacted their tax law using maneuvers to sidestep Democrats, and the White House rescinded already appropriated federal funds.
The House last year passed a $78 billion bipartisan business and child tax break bill and a year later voted to create treaty-like tax benefits to firms operating in Taiwan.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hopes to include her bill extending that break in any tax package that materializes this year, according to a spokesperson.
But he said hasn’t talked with his Republican colleagues about a broader package as the House remains in recess amid the shutdown.","Race tracks, film studios, and other businesses are in line to face higher taxes next year if lawmakers are unable to bridge the partisan rift widening on Capitol Hill.

The nearly two-week old shutdown that’s led to furloughs of thousands of federal workers hinges in part over looming expiration of an enhanced premium tax credit for health plans purchased on exchanges created by the Obama-era health care law.

But other bipartisan tax credits are also expiring. Their backers hope a year-end deal averts those cliffs but acknowledge the dearth of trust between the parties amid the shutdown bodes poorly.

“I’ll work with anybody on legislation that’s good for the American people and my district,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee’s tax subcommittee who co-sponsored a permanent extension of the race car break. “But this does kind of sour the soup.”

Extenders Left Behind

Congress has perennially passed what’s known as an extenders package, renewing mostly bipartisan expired and expiring tax breaks. Many of these, such as the expired credit for American Samoan tuna canneries, were left out of Republicans’ July mega law, leaving their fate to the whims of lawmakers considering a raft of issues in bipartisan legislation before the calendar turns.

Partisan rancor endures after Republicans enacted their tax law using maneuvers to sidestep Democrats, and the White House rescinded already appropriated federal funds.

Popular support for each extender break individually may be insufficient to overcome that strife, said Ray Beeman, who leads EY’s Washington Council practice.

Because lawmakers’ terms aren’t expiring this year, they may feel that waiting until 2026 and extending the breaks retroactively is more attractive, Beeman said. The funding lapse has also fractured the attention of lawmakers and their staff, dimming the prospects of planning a package.

“At least, while there’s a shutdown, I just don’t think anybody’s super focused on” other extenders, Beeman said.

There’s been little, if any, substantial negotiation over a year-end package.

Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the ranking member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters his discussions with Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) about such a deal have been minimal.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said he “will work with anybody to try to find common ground.” But he dinged the panel’s chair, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) for skipping a committee debate and vote on Republicans’ tax law despite his calls for “regular order.”

Spokespeople for Smith and Crapo did not return requests for comment.

The House last year passed a $78 billion bipartisan business and child tax break bill and a year later voted to create treaty-like tax benefits to firms operating in Taiwan. That’s giving some lawmakers reason to think an extenders deal is possible.

“We’ve shown that even in a pretty hyperpartisan environment, we were able to come together,” said Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), a senior member of the Ways and Means and Budget committees.

Employer, Film Studio Tax Breaks

One extender at stake is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which benefits employers who hire veterans, felons, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups. Smucker is pushing for an expansion of that bonus, arguing it ends up saving money as workers contribute to the Treasury.

The ability of film and TV studios, theaters, and sound recording studios to quickly write off their expenses also faces expiration. Lobbyists for the entertainment industry have sought to extend a long-standing benefit that allows such productions to immediately take advantage of depreciation rules that would normally have to wait for their work to premiere to claim.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hopes to include her bill extending that break in any tax package that materializes this year, according to a spokesperson. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), who has co-sponsored her bill, also wants to get it across the finish line.

“I disagree with her on almost everything, but here we finding a way to sing from the same song sheet,” he said.

Tax writers representing motorsports speedways are also hoping to preserve the tax treatment of race tracks used by operators big and small, including NASCAR.

“If any bill has a tax title, you see if you can insert it into the larger package,” said Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who represents the home of the Indy 500. “I’m imagining it’ll be a year-end play.”

Speedway operations don’t qualify for the taxpayer subsidies that other major league sports often get, and the industry is hoping they can avoid an expiration or at least apply the break retroactively next year so they stay on a level playing field with amusement parks and golf courses.

“The only thing that makes me feel good is that we’ve been in these positions before,” said Dean Aguillen, a principal at OGR who lobbies for the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States, the trade association for the motorsports industry.

Thompson, who has co-sponsored the House companion to Young’s motorsports bill, too hopes it can be included in a year-end package.

But he said hasn’t talked with his Republican colleagues about a broader package as the House remains in recess amid the shutdown.

“I just walked the halls this morning, can’t find a single one,” Thompson said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/6f9b989/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3994x1539+3+356/resize/960x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2F25%2Fef1344864aa4b11e5ffa7d366415%2F430123371.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:03:11.938499

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

In Italy, the company is supporting a 129 MW portfolio of solar and wind projects, with the first installation, a solar array in Sicily, expected to begin operations this month.
In Poland, where electricity generation remains heavily reliant on coal, Apple has supported Econergy’s 40 MW solar array, set to come online later this year.
Apple and its suppliers currently support more than 19 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity globally, powering both corporate operations and manufacturing facilities.
By 2030, Apple expects its European renewable portfolio to contribute around 3,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean electricity to the region’s grids each year.","The projects, along with a recently completed solar farm in Spain, will add a total of 650 megawatts (MW) of clean electricity generation capacity to European power grids over the coming years.

The company said the new infrastructure will generate more than one million megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable electricity annually by 2030, with about $600m in financing committed to support the projects.

The expansion of renewable energy is part of Apple’s plans to counteract emissions from product use, meaning the electricity consumed when customers charge and power their devices. This category represented about 29% of Apple’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2024.

The company aims to match all electricity used by customers globally with clean energy by the end of the decade. This is part of Apple’s broader goal to reach carbon neutrality across its operations and product lifecycle by 2030.

Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, said: “By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity.

“Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent.”

In Greece, Apple has signed a long-term agreement to buy energy from a 110 MW solar project owned by HELLENiQ ENERGY, which is now operational.

In Italy, the company is supporting a 129 MW portfolio of solar and wind projects, with the first installation, a solar array in Sicily, expected to begin operations this month.

In Poland, where electricity generation remains heavily reliant on coal, Apple has supported Econergy’s 40 MW solar array, set to come online later this year.

In Romania, the company has arranged to purchase power from Nala Renewables’ 99 MW wind farm now under construction in Galați County.

Apple has also signed a long-term power purchase agreement in Latvia with European Energy for one of the country’s largest planned solar farms, adding 110 MW of capacity once operational.

In Spain, a 131MW solar project developed by ib vogt in Segovia became operational earlier this year.

Apple and its suppliers currently support more than 19 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity globally, powering both corporate operations and manufacturing facilities.

By 2030, Apple expects its European renewable portfolio to contribute around 3,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean electricity to the region’s grids each year.

The Detroit automaker said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it is taking $1.6 billion in charges as it adjusts its EV strategy amid expectations that demand is about to slow.

In 2021, CEO Mary Barra set out ambitious plans for GM to be electric-only by 2035. Four years later, the Chevrolet owner is joining many of its rivals in rolling back its EV plans and investing in hybrids and gas-powered vehicles.

In the regulatory filing, GM said it expects the adoption rate of electric vehicles to slow in the US due to the scrapping of the $7,500 tax credit and the Trump administration's loosening of clean air regulations.

The company previously announced a $4 billion investment plan that will see it boost production of gas-powered SUVs and trucks in the US.

The charges, which GM expects to be recognized this quarter, include $1.2 billion stemming from adjustments in the company's EV capacity and $400 million in cancellation fees and settlements.

GM's share price was down nearly 2% premarket on the news.

Despite the progress, EVs still make up just 2 per cent of all vehicles on Australian roads.
Electric Vehicle Council CEO Julie Delvecchio said the findings highlight growing consumer confidence and policy impact.
“More Australians are steering towards electric vehicles because they are better for your budget, better for the climate, and better for Australia whether or not you drive an EV,” Delvecchio said.
“Australia is moving from the early adopters to the early majority where consistent policy support is crucial to sustaining EV growth,” Ms Delvecchio said.","Australia’s electric vehicle (EV) market has reached new milestones in sales, model availability and charging infrastructure, but continued growth will depend on sustained government and industry support, according to the State of EVs 2025 report released by the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC).

The report found Australians purchased 72,758 battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the first half of 2025 – a 24.4 per cent increase on the same period last year – lifting EVs to 12.1 per cent of all new car sales. Despite the progress, EVs still make up just 2 per cent of all vehicles on Australian roads.

Australia’s national EV fleet now exceeds 410,000 vehicles as of September 2025, with 153 EV models available to consumers – up from 123 a year earlier – following the introduction of the federal government’s New Vehicle Efficiency Standard.

Charging infrastructure also expanded, with 1,272 fast-charging locations and 4,192 high-power public charging plugs recorded nationwide, representing growth of 20 and 22 per cent respectively.

Electric Vehicle Council CEO Julie Delvecchio said the findings highlight growing consumer confidence and policy impact.

“More Australians are steering towards electric vehicles because they are better for your budget, better for the climate, and better for Australia whether or not you drive an EV,” Delvecchio said.

“In just one year we’ve seen electric vehicles reach record highs, high-power charging locations increase at pace, and dozens of new EV models hit the roads.”

However, the report cautions that stronger measures are needed to keep Australia on track to meet its emissions reduction targets.

The EVC estimates the country will need at least one million EVs on the road before 2028, requiring more than 700,000 additional sales over the next three years.

“Australia is moving from the early adopters to the early majority where consistent policy support is crucial to sustaining EV growth,” Ms Delvecchio said.

“We are making inroads in EV uptake as a nation, but the road ahead is steep. We need to shift gears from steady to more rapid growth in EV uptake to meet emissions reduction targets.”

The EVC’s report also assessed government performance, giving the federal government the highest rating (8 out of 10) for its EV policies, while Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory scored the lowest (3 out of 10).

Ms Delvecchio said continued collaboration between governments and industry would be key to maintaining momentum.

“No country has reached mass EV adoption without sustained government support, so withdrawing it now risks stalling the momentum we desperately need,” she said.

“Industry also has a role to play, including developing local battery manufacturing and recycling, upskilling the workforce, and raising EV awareness.”",https://www.australianmanufacturing.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AdobeStock_477989315.jpeg_Aliaksandr-Marko.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:23.720599

The Detroit automotive giant was one of the first to go big on EVs, announcing in 2021 that it would phase out gas and diesel cars globally by 2035. The announcement came shortly after former President Joe Biden took office pledging to boost EV sales. At one point it was planning to spend $30 billion on EVs by this year, including an all-electric lineup further down the track.

Now, things look very different. President Donald Trump ended federal tax credits that helped American buyers afford to buy expensive U.S.-made electric cars last month, while Chinese automakers have pulled off one of the fastest industrial takeovers in modern history by building about 70% of the world's EVs this year.

GM said Tuesday that about $1.2 billion of the charges were down to adjusting its EV capacity, but added that plans to address its manufacturing footprint are “ongoing”. That means it is “reasonably possible” that more costs could be on their way.

The other $400 million is down to cancelled contracts and settling other commercial arrangements linked to its EV investments, it said. Shares were down 1.6% in premarket trading.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in the filing.

GM said last month that it plans slower output of the Chevrolet Bolt, and is also scaling back producing its Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, saying at the time that it is “making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand.”

Ford has also cut investment, dropping models and taking a $1.9 billion charge last year. Chief executive Jim Farley recently said the market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

They just create more hurdles for American automakers already losing ground in every market that matters.
The only thing that can stop Chinese EV makers now is themselves — and their own government.
Chinese companies have two more years to flood global markets before Ford's cheaper truck arrives.","A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here.

Chinese automakers have pulled off one of the fastest industrial takeovers in modern history, building 70% of the world's electric vehicles and selling cars so advanced that Ford's CEO spent six months driving a Chinese EV instead of his own company's products. American executives call it an existential threat. But they're running out of time to do anything about it.

The gap between Chinese and American EVs keeps widening even as both sides struggle. Ford announced in August that it's finally adopting manufacturing techniques that China mastered years ago, but it still won't have a competitive $30,000 electric truck until 2027. The federal tax credits that helped American buyers afford the currently much more than $30,000 EVs? Ended last month by a Trump administration that's supposed to be protecting Detroit.

China's EV makers face their own crisis. BYD, the Chinese automaker that dethroned Tesla as the world's top EV seller last year, saw a monthly sales drop for the first time in 18 months in September. It's not alone: China's auto industry is grappling with massive overcapacity, with more than half of its production capacity sitting idle. Beijing, meanwhile, is cracking down on the price wars that fueled growth.

Even with those issues, Chinese manufacturers dominate — and the gap isn't just about price. When Ford CEO Jim Farley test-drove a Xiaomi SU7 last year, he was blown away by what $30,000 buys in China: a sedan that accelerates faster than many Porsches, with a giant touch screen that controls your house lights and a built-in AI assistant. ""It's fantastic,"" he said on a podcast. ""I don't want to give it up.""

In March, BYD unveiled five-minute charging that delivers 250 miles of range and an assisted driving system called ""God's Eye."" American EVs, by comparison, typically need 30 minutes of charging to get a similar range and still feel like regular cars that happen to be electric. Even Tesla's Elon Musk acknowledged the threat last year, saying Chinese automakers would ""pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world"" without trade barriers.

Those barriers are the only thing keeping Chinese EVs out of American driveways right now. The Biden administration imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, and the Trump administration has gone further, adding 54% tariffs on all Chinese goods and gutting EV tax credits that helped American buyers afford electric cars.

""As the words came out of Trump's mouth, they were probably drinking champagne in BYD headquarters,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told the New York Post after Trump's tariff announcement earlier this year. Ives said the trade taxes could cost U.S. auto brands as much as $100 billion per year while BYD gains room to expand in Europe, Mexico, and South America.

The irony is that Trump is trying to defeat a market that has already won. One in four cars sold globally this year will be electric, according to the International Energy Agency. But the Trump administration has frozen funding for EV charging infrastructure, eliminated the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, and spent months vilifying electric vehicles while boosting oil companies.

Trump’s policies won't stop the rest of the world from shifting to EVs. They just create more hurdles for American automakers already losing ground in every market that matters. And Washington's tariff wall won't hold forever. ""I don't know what the timeframe is, but I don't think we can say 'no, they're not going to come to the U.S.,'"" Ford's John Lawler told analysts in May.

The only thing that can stop Chinese EV makers now is themselves — and their own government. The domestic market, with about 50 manufacturers, is running out of buyers even as those companies compete with more and more price cuts. After five years of growth, BYD's sales fell 10% between May and August as Beijing cracked down on price wars and forced companies to pay suppliers faster. The solution? Go even harder on exporting. BYD now forecasts overseas sales will hit 20% of deliveries in 2025, up from under 10% in 2024.

The race isn't over, but the gap keeps growing. Chinese companies have two more years to flood global markets before Ford's cheaper truck arrives. American automakers risk being shut out of the electric future, not because they can't compete, but because by the time they're ready to try, the rest of the world will already be driving Chinese EVs.

President Donald Trump has made his distaste for wind and solar known in speeches and posts on social media, as well.","(CNN) — The Trump administration’s cancellation of the largest solar project in the United States has sparked confusion and concern among Republicans and Democrats alike.

Known as the Esmerelda 7, the collection of seven solar projects in rural Nevada was set to generate up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy when complete, enough to power 2 million homes. That’s an eye-popping amount of power to add to an electrical grid that desperately needs more of it, due to the insatiable demand from AI-related data centers and increasing residential needs.

Under former President Joe Biden, the federal government was moving the sprawling project through the federal permitting process as one proposal. Developers had planned to use 118,000 acres of federal land in Nevada’s desert as the home for solar arrays and batteries to store the sun’s energy.

Last week, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management quietly changed the project’s status to “canceled” on its federal permitting webpage. An Interior Department spokesperson said the status change was unrelated to the ongoing government shutdown and that project developers and the federal government had agreed to “change their approach” as part of “routine discussions” about the project.

There may still be a path forward for the Esmerelda 7; the Interior spokesperson said developers “will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM” for approval. However, environmental impact analyses can drag on for months or years, making the approval process much longer. And the federal government can also cancel individual projects again.

The project’s cancellation was first reported by Heatmap News.

Although the project was greenlit by the Biden administration, it remained controversial with some conservation groups and residents, who feared the sheer size of the solar arrays would impact critical desert wildlife habitat.

Desert tortoises and Joshua trees live in the area that would be developed for the solar array, said Erik Molvar, executive director of the Western Watersheds Project.

“It doesn’t make sense to trade off gains in climate while sacrificing biodiversity,” Molvar said. “We don’t see the conversion of vast areas of public land to renewable energy as the right solution to the climate crisis.”

NextEra Energy, one of the developers involved, said they “remain committed” to pursuing the project “and will continue to engage constructively” with the Bureau of Land Management, according to company spokesperson Neil Nissan.

The move to pull the plug on the project’s permitting approvals drew rare criticism from politicians of both parties.

“This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China,” Utah’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox posted on X. “Solar with batteries can now be close to baseload power and we should keep these projects rolling until we get the gas/nuclear/geothermal plants we need.”

Nevada’s two Democratic senators blasted the move and urged Interior Sec. Doug Burgum to clarify the project’s future.

“The Trump Administration’s lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement, adding solar has been a major economic driver in her sunny state.

“Nevada is a national leader in solar energy as the state with the most solar jobs per capita, and the Trump Administration’s attack on this industry will have dire effects on our economy,” added Sen. Jacky Rosen in a statement.

While the Trump administration has largely targeted wind projects via a series of stop work orders and cancellations, it has also created additional hurdles for solar projects to get through federal review. Earlier this year, Trump and congressional Republicans effectively killed tax credits for wind and solar projects, dramatically shortening the timeline during which developers could claim the credits.

An independent analysis from think tank Energy Innovation released this summer showed killing the tax credits would further raise US household energy bills over the next decade.

Since 2022, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which predicts prices will continue to rise through next year. Electricity prices are Americans’ second biggest annual energy expense, after paying for gasoline to fuel their vehicles, the EIA found.

Steven Zampieri | New York, N.Y. Why did you decide to apply to the Panda Ambassador program?
WWF's Panda Ambassador program is a great fit for me, allowing me to keep my day job and still have an impact.","The Panda Ambassador program is the ultimate next level of engagement for those committed to saving wildlife and the environment while supporting WWF. Your enthusiasm, ideas, and unique perspective, plus our worldwide reach and expertise, equal an unstoppable force for good. Together we can make a real, lasting impact on the future of our planet.

Panda Ambassadors are on the frontlines of environmental activism, leading their communities to engage the public and inspire real change. Panda Ambassadors host fun and educational events and activities, lead groups in marches and protests, and meet with politicians and business leaders.

We’re always looking for people who are ready to lead an environmental movement today, and who might just be leading the country tomorrow. If you think you’ve got what it takes, apply today.

Educate

The first step to behavior change is education. As a Panda Ambassador, you’ll explain to others how environmental issues can affect their lives, why they should care, and what they can do to help. Panda Ambassadors give presentations, host and attend events, and have one-on-one chats with community leaders. As an ambassador for WWF in your community, you will demonstrate the local relevance of global issues like climate change, wildlife crime, and food scarcity. You’ll also help people understand how their individual actions, behavior, and purchases have a global impact.

Inspire

Creating a better world doesn’t have to be a chore. Panda Ambassadors inspire people to care about the planet by having fun and connecting on a deeper level. It’s your creativity, new ideas, and enthusiasm that will make the most difference. Some ambassadors engage the public through works of art, creative and persuasive writing, hosting athletic activities like yoga or running, or even hosting parties with music and dancing. You are encouraged to leverage your talents and interests, whatever they may be, to attract others and get them involved.

Lead

Panda Ambassadors are the on-the-ground leaders of a new environmental movement, responsible for drumming up the local support that allows WWF to achieve big wins. You’ll lead your community’s participation in international WWF initiatives like Earth Hour and climate marches. You’ll coordinate support for changes in policy, laws, and business practices. You’ll stand up for your community—be it a college campus or an entire city—and lead it toward a more sustainable, Earth-friendly future.

Jennifer Tribble | Durham, N.C.

Why did you decide to apply to the Panda Ambassador program?

Before applying to the program, I followed WWF’s projects and advocacy work. In particular, I appreciate the work that WWF does bridging science to effective advocacy and environmental work across the world. When I saw the Panda Ambassador program, which was an opportunity to engage locally and raise awareness around some of WWF’s priority projects, I knew I wanted to be a part of that group.

What do you think is the most important thing people can do to help save the planet?

Vote! Find candidates and propositions that support environmental protections, and use your vote to elect representatives who will fight for our planet and our natural resources.

What gives you hope for the future?

I have a lot of hope for the future! One thing that gives me hope is seeing the younger generation standing up to fight for our planet and sustainability. There are so many kids doing inspirational and groundbreaking things, whether that’s fighting through legal battles, doing advocacy work, or starting their own companies. I am also inspired by the number of companies, large and small, that are shifting toward more sustainable products and manufacturing methods.

Jessica Miles | McLean, Va.

Why did you decide to apply to the Panda Ambassador program?

Being a Panda Ambassador has been an empowering experience that I am grateful to be a part of. I would encourage anyone who is looking to do more to help make the world better to apply to the program.

What have you done as a Panda Ambassador that you are most proud of?

Participating in Lobby Day this year was incredibly rewarding for me. I never really pictured myself getting an opportunity like that. I really enjoyed listening to presentations on how to tell our story, meeting other Panda Ambassadors, and practicing the day before we met with our representatives.

What do you think is the most important thing people can do to help save the planet?

When it comes to the environment, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and paralyzed at the sheer magnitude of what we’re facing. But doing something that feels manageable (even if it seems small and ridiculous) can be impactful. If you’ve never worked out in your life, you don’t wake up one morning and go run a marathon. You build up to it. Sometimes painfully slowly. The same is true about taking action on the environment.

What gives you hope for the future?

I’d say it’s more like determination than hope. Given everything happening both abroad and domestically, it’s a lot to handle. Plus, I think if you are just blindly hopeful about the future, you’re not really paying attention. But that's not a reason to stop fighting. The only thing I can give is everything I’ve got—and I think a healthy, sustainable planet is worth fighting for.

Steven Zampieri | New York, N.Y.

Why did you decide to apply to the Panda Ambassador program?

After months of watching the US government take a regressive approach on environmental issues (including its stance on fossil fuels, national parks funding, and the Paris climate accord), I felt like I needed to get involved. Since the health of the planet is reflected by the health of the animals around us, I'm hopeful that if we're able to take care of them, they'll actually be taking care of us. WWF's Panda Ambassador program is a great fit for me, allowing me to keep my day job and still have an impact.

What have you done as a Panda Ambassador that you are most proud of?

Lobby Day in March was a terrific experience. I felt energized by hearing from other Panda Ambassadors, getting a deeper understanding of important legislation, and connecting directly with our elected officials to let them know that voters care about environmental issues and expect Congress to act accordingly.

What do you think is the most important thing people can do to help save the planet?

Tweak our lifestyles to reduce our carbon footprints—recycle, eat less meat, buy fewer things that last longer—and generally be conscious of what we take from the world around us. If we all try to take a little less and give back where possible, we'll make tremendous strides toward a better, more sustainable world.

What gives you hope for the future?

I'm encouraged by the surging numbers of consumers and employees who seek out companies that give back socially and environmentally, and I'm hopeful that this demand can create a positive feedback loop that sets us on the right track for sustainability.",https://assets.worldwildlife.org/www-prd/images/Medium_WW269650.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c100.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:11:59.634187

Some auto industry executives, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, have warned that EV sales will drop significantly in the absence of the tax credit. However, some, including the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, have said that the EV market remains resilient.

Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans.

The changes will not affect GM's current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs that are in production.

The Detroit automaker warned of the possibility of further charges as a result of the reassessment of its capacity and manufacturing footprint, which it said was still ongoing.

The charges comprise a $1.2 billion non-cash impairment related to EV capacity adjustments and $400 million for contract-cancellation fees and commercial settlements.

The charges will be recorded as adjustments to the automaker’s non-GAAP results for the third quarter scheduled for early next weeek.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next.

And the coal plant outage highlights a growing debate over which energy sources are best suited to power large loads.
If it were operating, the 932-megawatt Sandy Creek plant would be able to power more than half a million homes.
The coal plant shut down in late February for routine maintenance ahead of summer, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
However, some experts say the Sandy Creek outage highlights what can go wrong with large power plants.","The Sandy Creek Energy Station is America’s newest coal-fired power plant, and it’s expected to remain offline until 2027. The power plant near Waco, Texas, which began delivering power to the grid in 2013, suffered a major failure in April after it was shuttered for maintenance.

The extended outage comes as Texas’ electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, has sounded the alarm over rising demand for electricity. While solar and battery development are booming across Texas, the state government is offering low-interest loans to incentivize the construction of new power plants. And the coal plant outage highlights a growing debate over which energy sources are best suited to power large loads.

What happened at Sandy Creek?

If it were operating, the 932-megawatt Sandy Creek plant would be able to power more than half a million homes. The coal plant shut down in late February for routine maintenance ahead of summer, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It remained offline through April 21.

Operators restarted the unit on April 22 and 23. Power output climbed slowly before nearly reaching full capacity by 9 p.m. on the second day. But shortly after 11 p.m., a major failure forced a complete shutdown, according to a report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The power plant hasn’t run since.

ERCOT initially reported that the facility would return to service on June 1, 2026. The grid operator now does not expect Sandy Creek to be back online until March 31, 2027 — a total outage exceeding two years, according to ERCOT’s September Monthly Outlook for Resource Adequacy.

The exact cause of the failure has not been publicly disclosed. The power plants’ owners, including Sandy Creek Energy Associates and the Lower Colorado River Authority, did not respond to questions from Straight Arrow News.

What’s the history of the power plant?

This is not the first incident to befall Sandy Creek. Over a decade ago, the power plant’s initial startup was delayed by more than a year.

Construction nearly finished in late 2011, with the plant expected to begin commercial operations in early 2012. But during testing in October 2011, the boiler sustained severe damage when tubes overheated, according to Standard & Poor’s. The credit rating agency downgraded its financial outlook on the project following the incident.

Repairs stretched beyond a year. The plant finally started commercial operations in May 2013, according to reporting by NPR.

What does it say about coal power and reliability?

The outage comes as the Trump administration has ordered some coal plants to stay open past their initially planned retirement dates. The administration’s energy policy has prioritized large power plants that are designed to operate through all hours of the day, instead of wind and solar power, that is dependent on specific weather conditions.

In a press release announcing federal funding for the coal industry, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said coal power is “vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption.”

In this view, power plants are more valuable for the grid because they are not intermittent sources. However, some experts say the Sandy Creek outage highlights what can go wrong with large power plants.

“The two-year outage at Sandy Creek highlights the reliability risks of fossil-fueled power,” Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at IEEFA, wrote, “and reinforces the need for wind, solar and battery sources that are more distributed and more reliable.”

Sandy Creek’s problems echo those at Comanche 3, a 750-MW coal unit in Colorado that opened in 2010. After repeated outages, including a year-long closure in 2020, owner Xcel Energy agreed to close the plant in 2030 — some 40 years earlier than originally planned.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2150754136_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 11:01:50.671352

US manufacturing is back in the policy spotlight. After decades of offshoring and industrial stagnation, lawmakers are advancing legislation to bring production home, support innovation, and create resilient supply chains. From the CHIPS and Science Act to expanded R&D tax credits, the message is clear: America wants to make things again.

But legislative momentum is only part of the story. The reality on the ground is more complex. Manufacturing investments take years to scale. Labor markets face deep skill shortages. Regulatory and trade frameworks remain inconsistent. These challenges point to a simple but often overlooked truth: time, not just policy, is the critical input in reviving US industry.

A new wave of pro-growth policy is taking shape

Recent years have seen a cascade of laws designed to reshore industrial capacity and spur innovation. The CHIPS and Science Act provides $280 billion in funding for semiconductor manufacturing, research, and workforce development. The Inflation Reduction Act supports clean manufacturing and energy infrastructure with long-term tax incentives. And perhaps most critically for many firms, changes to the treatment of R&D costs now allow immediate expensing rather than multi-year amortization.

For manufacturers, this represents a significant shift. Immediate tax relief for domestic R&D makes cash flow planning more predictable and encourages longer-term innovation bets. Permanent credits also offer a degree of certainty often absent in past tax policy cycles.

Federal investment is also paired with rising state-level competition. Many states now offer stackable tax credits, expedited permitting processes, or training grants to attract manufacturers. The landscape is increasingly shaped not just by federal mandates but by regional strategies to become next-generation industrial hubs.

Yet as these incentives expand, many firms remain cautious. Large-scale investments in physical infrastructure, workforce development, and supplier relationships require more than line-item funding. They require time, execution, and a clear regulatory runway.

Time is the missing variable in the manufacturing equation

Manufacturing is not a software startup. Capital projects take years from planning to production. Semiconductor fabrication facilities, for example, can take three to five years to build and commission. Battery plants, precision machining centers, and pharmaceutical facilities face similarly long lead times.

Time also matters in workforce development. Retraining workers or building pipelines through technical colleges and apprenticeships is a multi-year effort. The lag between funding announcements and actual skilled labor output is often underestimated in political discourse.

In addition, supply chains do not reorganize overnight. A manufacturer moving operations back to the US must find or develop domestic suppliers, requalify materials, and test for quality assurance, all before full production can resume. That complexity increases in regulated industries like aerospace or life sciences.

This extended timeline makes consistency in policymaking essential. Tax credits that expire in three years do not align with a facility that takes five years to build. Infrastructure bills with one-time funding windows often fall short of long-term operational needs. To succeed, pro-growth policies must match the real tempo of manufacturing.

Regulatory complexity and global trade volatility create friction

Despite favorable legislation, many firms still hesitate to commit. One major reason is regulatory friction. Permitting timelines are long and vary across states. Environmental assessments, zoning approvals, and community negotiations can stretch for months or even years, delaying projects that are otherwise ready to proceed.

Trade policy also introduces uncertainty. Fluctuating tariffs on raw materials like steel, aluminum, and rare earths make cost modeling unpredictable. Waivers may be granted, but the process and timing are unclear. For many manufacturers, especially in high-margin or low-volume segments, this volatility complicates capital planning.

The regulatory cost of compliance, particularly for energy-intensive or emissions-sensitive industries, presents another challenge. While environmental standards are essential, navigating overlapping federal, state, and local regulations creates added costs and delays.

Workforce strategy must match industrial ambition

No matter how generous the incentives, they mean little without a skilled workforce. US manufacturing faces a demographic cliff. Many experienced machinists, operators, and supervisors are approaching retirement, with too few younger workers entering to replace them.

The pipeline is broken at multiple points. K–12 education has largely moved away from industrial skills. Vocational training is often outdated or underfunded. Community colleges play a critical role but frequently lack the equipment, instructors, or partnerships needed to keep pace with modern manufacturing.

Some companies are acting. Siemens, Toyota, and other manufacturers have launched their own apprenticeship programs. Others partner with state governments to co-fund training centers. But these initiatives take time to scale and deliver results.

Immigration policy is also a factor. Skilled immigrants have historically played a major role in the tech and manufacturing sectors, but current visa systems are not designed for industrial roles. Without reform, this remains an underused resource.

Industrial revitalization must include a labor plan. That means investing in education, modernizing training programs, aligning certifications with employer needs, and expanding access to skilled immigration pathways. Without this, even well-funded factories may remain idle.

Reviving US manufacturing is not a short-term effort. The current mix of tax incentives, infrastructure spending, and regulatory reform is a strong foundation. But its success depends on sustained commitment and realistic timelines.

Manufacturing plays a strategic role in the US economy. It supports high-wage jobs, anchors critical supply chains, and strengthens national security. The policy framework is improving. Capital is cautiously returning. What matters now is staying the course, maintaining support, reducing red tape, and investing in the human infrastructure that makes factories run.

His adrenaline racing, he remembered making sure his harness was clipped not once, but twice.

He’d never climbed up onto a roof before, let alone with a 50-pound panel of metal and wires strapped to his body. Each step tested his nerves. He could feel the shingles shift beneath his boots, and the June heat pressing through the soles. Below, life in Houston’s Fifth Ward unfolded: a swirl of distant freeway noise, laughter from his co-workers, and the ever-present backdrop of refinery stacks on the horizon.

Less than a year earlier, locked behind prison walls, he never could have imagined being handed the chance to invest in his city — or, even more improbably, to be investing in himself. Yet here he was, working shoulder-to-shoulder with a team to transform sunlight into electricity, forging a new sense of purpose in every bolt and connection.

This past summer, Dillard was one of roughly 50 participants in an inaugural solar installation training program geared toward Black, low-income residents of Houston, many of them formerly incarcerated, and from parts of the city long associated with poverty and pollution.

The 22-week training hosted by the Black United Fund of Texas, the city of Houston, and the Green Thumb Academy offered students not just a steady paycheck of $18 an hour and certification in solar installation via the National Center for Construction Education and Research, but the possibility to heal, build, and protect their communities.

“It gave me a sense of purpose,” said Dillard, a 37-year-old who was incarcerated for two years before his release in September 2024.

As he puts it, his hometown is the “energy capital of the world.” But for so long, that designation has actually come at the expense of the Black people who call Houston and Southeast Texas home, researchers have concluded. For generations, Fifth Ward residents unknowingly lived on a plume of coal tar, toxic waste from a neighboring rail yard that was abandoned and leached into the soil. Eventually, cancer clusters began to develop in the neighborhood. Today, residents are expected to die two decades before residents born in more affluent and white Houston neighborhoods.

But Dillard said this program was allowing him to do work that breaks cycles of harm while literally generating cleaner futures for the neighborhoods that have long been burdened by oil and gas pollution.

“Being a part of [the program] felt like creating history,” he said. “Learning the trade with people from similar backgrounds [not only] gave us something to offer back to society, but also ourselves.”

Yet the very training that provided Dillard a lifeline almost disappeared as quickly as it began.

The program was funded in part by a $20 million grant from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to the Black United Fund of Texas and the Houston Health Department. It was a part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, a $2 billion pool of money meant to stimulate the economy by investing in infrastructure upgrades to protect communities from climate threats like hurricanes and wildfires. The Biden administration also wanted those funds to be used to address environmental justice issues, which residents of Fifth Ward said they have faced in the form of pollution for decades.

However, the funds were targeted for reversal in Project 2025, the conservative manifesto that the administration of President Donald Trump uses as a framework for many of its policies. In May, Trump directed the EPA to cancel the grants, leaving the Houston training program in limbo. Later in the summer, the administration sought to cancel $7 billion in funding for solar programs and installation in Black and low-income areas. About a quarter of the students dropped out of the Houston program after the funding issues were made public.

Still, that didn’t stop the Black United Fund.

“We’ve worked before without literal dollars,” Velika Thomas said in February as Trump began his environmental cuts. “It would be awesome to have the money, but we’re going to get through it somehow” without federal support. And even with an annual budget of around $250,000, the organization did just that. The program combined funds and grants to pay the wages of the trainees.

For Thomas, the dilemma confirmed how important it is to support her own community. “As a Black person, I have not felt that America has ever put us at the forefront,” she said. “We are not a waste; the community is not a waste.”

As the Trump administration continues slashing federal support for climate programs and dismissing the impact of environmental racism, leaders of the program known as Vulnerable to Vibrant say cities need to continue to put forth such solutions even without federal support.

Advocates said community support in the form of donations can also sustain critical climate programs even if the federal government reduces or stops direct funding. Last year, environmental organizations saw an 8% increase in giving, reaching an all-time high of nearly $22 billion being donated for such work. Between 2021 and 2023, the donations and grants received by the Black United Fund nearly quadrupled.

“We can chart a way out while doing good for our people,” Shanitra Sanford, a graduate of the solar program, told Capital B. “We should all strive for that.”

Despite the disruption in federal funding, state and philanthropic investments continue to produce measurable local outcomes. Programs have popped up in each of the 10 geographic regions of the U.S. organized by the EPA. Watts Rising in Los Angeles has completed dozens of rooftop solar installations and multiple job placements in energy workforce pipelines for low-income residents. Chicago’s Renewing Sovereignty Project has certified dozens of formerly incarcerated people for clean energy employment.

For Sanford, who was incarcerated a total of four years, the focus on training people in solar installation is also about investing in a more stable and hopeful future for her three children, whose ages range from 2 to 15.

“I want to give them a sense of confidence in themselves and their home,” she said.

Health researchers estimate that transitioning the U.S. fully from fossil fuels to clean energy sources like solar could prevent more than 50,000 premature deaths every year by eliminating air pollution from energy-related activities.

Texas now ranks second only to California in total solar energy usage, and employs the third most people in the U.S. solar industry. The state added thousands of new solar jobs last year alone, while oil and gas employment shrank by about 8% since July 2024.

Another community solar group, Green Careers Texas, has connected dozens of trainees from local initiatives across the state and helped complete hundreds of installations through municipal and nonprofit partnerships.

This momentum in clean energy, program managers hope, shows how local action can drive broad impact.

As is the Black United Fund’s motto: “When we help ourselves, we help the total community at large become productive, and being partners in the community ensures the future of all people.”

Texas program connects formerly incarcerated workers to green energy

Sanford’s introduction to the program was as much about learning the physical realities of solar installation as it was absorbing the layered reasons the training existed in the first place. On most days, participants split time between classroom instruction — covering electrical basics, Occupational Safety and Health Administration safety rights, and the mechanics of solar arrays — and afternoons hoisting panels, climbing rungs, and practicing real rooftop installations on homes and in neighborhood mock-ups.

In a converted classroom in the Fifth Ward, the cohort of men and women — most recently released from Texas prisons — learned together about the ways that this labor could improve the health of their neighborhoods.

Timesha Beattie of Green Thumb Academy, leading a team of trainers and organizers, opened sessions with reminders of what certification could mean for families and neighborhoods: “Once you earn these credentials, nobody can ever take them away. You are going to be able to take back to your families the knowledge, the information, the credentials.” Sanford and Dillard could almost recite back word for word what Beattie said weeks after the class had ended.

The practical details mattered. The city and its partners provided not only a paycheck but the kind of support usually reserved for full-time jobs like direct deposit and worksite insurance. “It was book knowledge, but also it was hands-on — getting that panel on the roof, working as a team, finding out who you could rely on,” Sanford said.

The pay “was pretty good,” Dillard said, but more importantly, it gave him somewhere to be in community in the early months of his release.

Students handled gear, tested wiring alongside mentors, and learned how the electricity generated from sunlight powered nearby homes. By the end of the five-month program, participants could identify wiring color codes, install ceiling fans, and debate the future of Texas clean energy. The path from enrollment to graduation winnowed the group from 50 to a dozen, which training organizers said was a testament to the program’s rigor. But those who remained left with certifications, a pathway to union apprenticeships, and a sense of possibility.

“Learning this trade, whether plumbing, electrical, or construction … it’s something you can do as a career and retire from,” Dillard said.

Rather than training people to leave their community for jobs elsewhere, the program’s structure funneled graduates toward local employment. Training organizers and graduates said they see the initiative as a template resilient enough to function even at a moment when the validity of climate change is under question: rooted in local networks, able to partner with colleges and city agencies, and nimble enough to weather uncertain federal funding. “We have the tools and the networks in our communities to do this,” Sanford said.

Without stable, large-scale federal funding, programs like the one in Houston can make only a small dent in the overall shift to clean energy. Local training and job placements are important, but big challenges — like complex utility regulations and the high upfront cost of solar panels — get in the way. Experts say that to bring clean energy to many more communities, the government needs to restore and expand public investment and create better policies that help these local efforts grow beyond just small pilot projects.

However, replicating Houston’s model is a start. These programs may not guarantee clean energy for every city block, but participants said they offer one blueprint for economic reintegration in neighborhoods overlooked by America’s billion-dollar energy boom.

For the first few months after he was released from prison, Dillard said he would tell anybody he could that being incarcerated was “probably the best thing that ever happened” to him. It was the first time he was able to participate in an educational program that he believed could benefit his life and where he was supported as an individual.

But as the one-year anniversary of his release approached, he said his earlier belief had changed.

“I really just needed to be a part of [the program], be a part of something,” he said as he thumbed at copies of his new certificates and diploma from the training, which he proudly laminated on his own.

“You have to make a choice to take a chance, or your life will never change. But you need other people with you on that journey.”",https://i0.wp.com/capitalbnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC09943-Large-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1368&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-14 08:01:41.286395

It’s a vicious cycle – climate change reduces agricultural yields, which forces farmers to convert more forests to cropland, which adds more carbon to the atmosphere and worsens climate change.","A draft report commissioned by the Trump administration’s Department of Energy, or DOE, misleadingly claims that increasing levels of carbon dioxide could be beneficial for agriculture. In fact, mainstream climate experts have found that rising CO2 levels, by causing climate change, are harmful to agriculture overall – and likely to cause food prices to increase.

The Trump administration’s claim arose from a draft “critical review” report commissioned by DOE and written by fringe experts. The DOE subsequently disbanded that group when faced with a lawsuit alleging that it violated a law requiring that such federal advisory committees must be transparent and unbiased.

The Environmental Protection Agency cited the DOE report in a proposal to reverse its Obama-era determination that carbon pollution poses a threat to public health and welfare. The agency argued that higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will increase the amount of food that farmers produce, implying that carbon pollution is a good thing.

“Recent data and analysis show that even marginal increases in CO2 concentrations have substantial beneficial impacts on plant growth and agricultural productivity, and that this benefit has been significantly greater than previously believed,” the agency wrote.

Mainstream climate experts say that’s incorrect.

In response to the DOE report, a group of 85 climate experts and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine each published comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature and arrived at the opposite conclusion. These expert reports found that rather than boosting agricultural productivity, the body of scientific evidence indicates that increased extreme weather resulting from climate change will instead reduce crop yields, making food more expensive.

Weather disasters are very, very bad for crops

The notion that crops will benefit from climate pollution is based on the fact that plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Scientists have known for decades that in a controlled environment like a glass greenhouse, higher CO2 levels in the air will cause plants to grow bigger.

But Earth’s atmosphere isn’t a controlled environment. Increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere trap extra heat like a blanket, causing more frequent extreme weather like heat waves, droughts, and floods. These events stress plants and hamper their growth and productivity.

Innovations in agricultural practices like the use of fertilizers, pesticides, new seed varieties, and irrigation have boosted crop yields over the past century. But increasingly extreme weather could slow those gains.

To study these complex variables, scientists have conducted what are known as free-air CO2 enrichment, or FACE, experiments. These studies use pipes or vents to release carbon dioxide into large open plots of crops.

A 2020 analysis of 30 years of FACE experiments found that higher carbon dioxide concentrations increased crop yields as expected when “under non-stress conditions.” But when stressed by factors like changing temperatures or precipitation, as climate experts said recently, “the yield increases were suppressed and in some cases erased.”

Climate damages overwhelm farmers’ efforts to adapt

Farmers may be able to adapt to some climate impacts, for example, by adjusting plant varieties, fertilizers, and crop cultivation windows. But those changes won’t be sufficient to fully overcome damage from climate change, according to a study published in June 2025.

The study’s authors estimated that each additional 1°C of global warming in 2100 will reduce crop yields by the equivalent of 4.4% of each person on Earth’s recommended daily calorie intake. Most staple crops, including wheat, corn, and soybeans, will see significant yield declines.

Read: More CO2 in the atmosphere hurts key plants and crops more than it helps

And farmers are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Another 2025 study found that thanks to more efficient farming practices, the amount of global land devoted to agriculture could have decreased 2% over the past 30 years – while growing the same amount of food. Instead, global croplands expanded by nearly 4% during that time because climate change slowed the growth in agricultural productivity.

The paper estimated that those climate impacts caused over 200 million acres of land to be converted to cropland – twice the area of California. And converting existing ecosystems like forests to agricultural land reduced the amount of carbon absorbed by plant life on Earth. The study estimated that this land conversion added 22 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That’s the equivalent of about six months of humanity’s carbon dioxide emissions.

It’s a vicious cycle – climate change reduces agricultural yields, which forces farmers to convert more forests to cropland, which adds more carbon to the atmosphere and worsens climate change.

Climate change could make food more expensive

As the law of supply and demand tells us, if crop yields are suppressed while people still need to eat the same amount of food, prices will rise. A 2024 study estimated that “annual food inflation of 1-3 percentage points per year could result from temperatures projected for 2035.”

Another problem is that climate change is worsening many different types of extreme weather, which can sometimes strike the same place at the same time. Scientists call these events compound extremes.

A 2022 study looked at the impacts of these compound extremes on crop yields. The authors concluded, “Since around 2000, these compound extremes, and hot droughts in particular, have been linked to especially poor harvests (up to 30% yield losses) in regions such as India, Ethiopia, the USA, Europe and Russia.” For example, a combined heat wave and drought in the Midwest U.S. in 2012 was estimated to reduce corn yields by 20% that season.

And a 2021 paper found that over the prior three decades, temperature-related crop losses resulted in $27 billion in crop insurance claims due to reduced yields in part as a result of these kinds of severely suppressed crop yield seasons.

The verdict: carbon damages overwhelm benefits for crops

As this body of scientific research illustrates, although plants directly benefit from higher carbon dioxide levels, the damages from extreme weather are already becoming bigger than those benefits.

Farmers have so far been able to overcome those climate damages by devoting more land to agriculture and implementing innovative practices. But there are limits to land and water availability, and detrimental effects on the environment and health from applying too many pesticides and fertilizers.

Meanwhile, climate damages will only worsen as long as temperatures continue to rise. As the report written by 85 climate scientists concluded, “in the major agricultural growing regions of the U.S. (and in most parts of the world), CO2-induced climate change will lead to yield declines.” That will lead to higher food prices until humanity stops the rise in global temperatures by reaching net-zero carbon pollution.",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/202510-is-global-warming-good-for-plants.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-14 08:02:22.778813

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",https://www.tricityrecordnm.com/wp-content/themes/durango/images/default_article_image_dur.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 12:16:38.932865

Wind turbines are some of the biggest ones, but there are other large military payloads as well.”","The infrastructure underpinning ground transport is designed for daily commerce – not the specialised demands of oversized industrial cargo.

As global requirements evolve, supply chains face mounting pressure, particularly in sectors like renewable energy, where the scale of components for wind turbines presents a major logistical test.

Radia, an aerospace company founded in 2016 by engineer Mark Lundstrom, is developing a solution to this challenge.

Its WindRunner aircraft is designed to transport the world’s largest wind turbine blades and other oversized cargo to remote locations that are inaccessible by road or rail.

With the next generation of turbine blades set to exceed 100 metres, traditional road infrastructure, which is limited to blades of around 70 metres, requires a fundamental reconsideration of logistics.

Redefining onshore wind logistics

The WindRunner is being positioned not just as a cargo aircraft but as a logistics enabler for the renewable energy sector. Its primary function is to unlock supply chains that are currently constrained by the weight and length of wind turbine blades that conventional ground transportation cannot support.

The aircraft's design allows it to carry turbine blades over 105 metres long and land on semi-prepared, unpaved runways as short as 1,800 metres.

According to Radia, the aircraft will offer 7,700 cubic metres of cargo space, which is approximately ten times the volume of a Boeing 777, and can carry a payload of between 72.6 and 80 tonnes.

This capability could mean it can deliver components directly to project sites far from ports or major roadways, potentially cutting the need for complex and expensive last-mile logistics.

Following its public reveal at the 2025 Paris Air Show, Radia is targeting a first flight in 2029, with commercial service expected in the early 2030s.

This development is particularly relevant for onshore wind energy. Radia's broader initiative, termed GigaWind, aims to facilitate the onshore deployment of the largest turbines ever used.

The goal is to apply the economies of scale seen in offshore wind projects to inland locations, leading to longer blades, taller turbines and greater energy output.

Addressing a supply chain bottleneck

The WindRunner project does more than just transport wind turbine parts; it addresses a primary threat to clean energy growth, which is logistics.

In 2023, Tim Dawidowsky, Chief Operating Officer at Siemens Gamesa, explained: “The supply chain is facing substantial challenges that could limit production capacity and increase turbine prices.”

By enabling the direct delivery of larger blades to remote sites, WindRunner could remove a long-standing obstacle for the industry.

It is designed to bypass congested roads and bridges, avoid the constraints of rail networks and eliminate the need for costly infrastructure upgrades to reach build sites. This change could also improve the cost curve for wind energy.

Taller turbines with longer blades are capable of producing more energy more consistently, delivering what Radia calls a ""step function improvement"" in both output and reliability compared to current-generation turbines.

The aircraft's potential applications extend beyond the energy sector. Its large cargo bay and rugged landing capabilities make it suitable for other oversized loads, such as military payloads, disaster relief materials and large aerospace components.

Mark Lundstrom, Founder and CEO of Radia, says, “We are essentially looking at building a platform for moving the biggest things in the world in the hardest-to-reach places. Wind turbines are some of the biggest ones, but there are other large military payloads as well.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/43b678a286dbc7e98762f90cfc79a2fc:a01ae83e0440c29720886aeebaa17372/unloading-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 11:01:22.283757

,EVs,2025-10-14 11:17:35+00:00,Heatmap News,Alsym Thinks It Can Break the U.S. Battery Manufacturing Curse - Heatmap News,Katie Brigham,,,,,https://heatmap.news/climate-tech/alsym-sodium-ion-launch,"Aghion argues that climate policy needs to hit hard and hit quickly, precisely to induce the kind of competitive innovation that he thinks drives economic growth.
But the power of dirty business remained immense — and opposed to climate policy.
The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation.
The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability.
In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing.","“I think innovation is the best hope for climate change,” Aghion said in a 2023 interview with VoxTalks Economics. “Of course, we need to innovate in our day to day behavior, but we’ll fight climate change because we will find new sources of energy that are cleaner than coal or gas, and because we will also find ways to produce with energy-saving devices.”

Along with Brown University economist Peter Howitt, Aghion developed mathematical models to describe how creative destruction works, building on foundational work by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter. Along the way, Aghion also worked with 2024 Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu, who won his prize for describing the institutions that best foster economic growth.

Aghion and Acemoglu have tangled with fellow laureate William Nordhaus, whose models of how the harms of climate change slow down economic growth practically invented the field of climate economics. In Nordhaus’ framing, climate change is the ultimate externality — that is, an economic factor not reflected in the market. The most efficient way to solve climate change, then, is to price in the externality by putting a tax on carbon emissions. Once the price of highly emitting goods reflects the true cost of producing them, the market will naturally favor lower-emitting goods.

Aghion instead sees carbon prices as another way to spur climate-friendly innovation throughout the economy.

In a 2014 paper written with Cameron Hepburn, Alexander Teytelboym, and Dimitri Zenghelis, Aghion argued that “product and process innovation” will ultimately drive decarbonization. Previous approaches to climate economics, Aghion wrote, use inadequate models for the effects of innovation, and so “significantly bias the assessment of the cost of future low-carbon technologies” to be higher than they are in reality.

To be clear, Aghion isn’t against a carbon tax. “A carbon tax or carbon price is a tool to redirect natural charge but it’s not the only tool,” Aghion said during the 2023 interview. “You need other tools, as well,” including “subsidies to green innovation, and more generally green industrial policy.” The point is less to discourage emitters and more to encourage the producers of non-emitting technologies.

Aghion argues that climate policy needs to hit hard and hit quickly, precisely to induce the kind of competitive innovation that he thinks drives economic growth. “If you wait longer, firms will be even better at dirty technologies, and it will take longer before their skills on clean technologies catch up with their skills on dirty technologies, and so you need to act promptly,” he said in 2023.

In a 2012 paper on the auto industry written with Antoine Dechezleprêtre, David Hemous Ralf Martin, and John Van Reenen, Aghion tracks patents in the auto industry and finds that “higher fuel prices induce firms to redirect technical change towards clean innovation and away from dirty innovation.”

He also finds that the nature of the firms matters. Companies that have a background in green technology innovate more in green technology, while companies that specialize in carbon-emitting or “dirty” technologies are more likely to find better ways to emit carbon. You’d expect Porsche or Ferrari to come up with a better internal combustion engine than Tesla, for instance, but for Tesla to invest more in pushing the capabilities of electric drivetrains.

Tesla is in many ways the ideal example of this kind of policy mix working. The company has benefited both from federal and state taxes on gasoline (as well as California’s unique emissions rules), which suppress demand for fossil fuels, and from subsidies and other financial support, which helped it reach economies of scale and performance parity with internal combustion vehicles more quickly.

While theoretically every auto company had the same incentives in both California and the nation as a whole to develop electric vehicles, Tesla made up the bulk of the entire market for years as it never had to split its focus between a legacy internal combustion business and a battery electric business.

Aghion’s work supports this kind of “belt-and-suspenders” approach to climate policy, where fossil fuel emissions are made more expensive and subsidies are provided to advance green innovation.

This may sound pretty familiar. While America’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, eschewed carbon taxes in favor of incentives and subsidies, the overall policy mix pursued by the Biden administration — including a fee on methane emissions, regulations on tailpipe and power plant emissions, and increased fuel economy standards — approximated this mix.

Aghion clearly recognized the IRA as a real life version of his ideas. When asked in 2023 about the kind of industrial policy he envisioned, he said, “The Americans are doing it now with the IRA.”

This kind of policy mix wasn’t just optimal policy economically, but also necessary politically.

Pointing to France’s experience with fuel taxes, which led to country-wide protests beginning in 2018, he cautioned that if policy makes dirty fuels more expensive without making clean technology technology cheaper, “then people riot.”

Of course, the IRA and other U.S. climate policies have not been as politically durable as their supporters hoped for. This is despite the fact that, alongside trying to boost green businesses, recent attempts at industrial policy explicitly tried to support “dirty” business, as well, whether by subsidizing older auto companies’ investments in electric vehicles or by supporting carbon capture and hydrogen investments by big oil companies.

But the power of dirty business remained immense — and opposed to climate policy.

The oil and gas industry were some of the biggest supporters of President Trump’s reelection campaign. Since he took office, one of their own — former fracking executive Chris Wright — has overseen the dismantling of much of the Energy Department’s investments in clean energy.

The basic calculus of Aghion’s approach may very well persist as rich countries struggle with growth and the harms attributed to climate change continue to add up.

“I think now we made progress on the idea that innovation is a big part of the solution and … that carbon price is not enough,” he said. “You need smart industrial policy aimed at green innovation. That’s the idea.”

Republicans are growing frustrated with President Donald Trump’s rollbacks of policies to support solar energy, the cheapest and fastest-growing source of electricity at a moment when power prices are soaring nationwide. In Georgia, voters who backed the president say the repeal of programs that offered free panels to low-income Americans is making them second-guess their ballots. One of those voters, 39-year-old Jennifer McCoy told The New York Times, “I like a lot of Trump’s outlooks on things, but there are some things, like the solar panels, that I don’t like, now that I know.”

Utah Governor Spencer Cox, meanwhile, went on a tear on X over the Bureau of Land Management’s quashing of the nation’s largest solar project, the 6.2-gigawatt Esmeralda 7 in Nevada. In a post that linked to the scoop Heatmap’s Jael Holzman published last week on the cancellation, Cox said, “This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China.” While he noted that “intermittent sources have been overvalued in the past (and offshore wind is a disaster and should be discontinued), the incredible leaps in battery technology completely change the value proposition of solar in the right places.” He went on to re-post messages from three think tank researchers criticizing the move and warnings about the energy needs of data centers.

2. Corpus Christi, a Texas energy boom town, is running out of water

Corpus Christi is the main water provider for South Texas, a region that has drawn the likes of Tesla, Exxon Mobil, fuel refineries, plastic producers, and lithium processors with what The Wall Street Journal called “the promise of land, cheap energy and, perhaps most critically, abundant water.” But a crippling drought is depleting the region’s reservoirs, and the city may fail to meet the area’s water demand in as little as 18 months. “Cue the panic,” the newspaper wrote. Industrial plants are bracing for rate hikes. “The water situation in South Texas is about as dire as I’ve ever seen it,” said Mike Howard, chief executive of Howard Energy Partners, a private energy company that owns several facilities in Corpus Christi. “It has all the energy in the world, and it doesn’t have water.”

3. Chinese turbine giant invests $2 billion in a Scottish factory

China last week ratcheted up restrictions on exports of rare earths, including for electric vehicle batteries and semiconductors, kicking off another round of the trade war with the United States. But in Scotland, one of China’s biggest wind turbine manufacturers is investing more than $2 billion in building a new factory. Guangdong-based Ming Yang announced plans for its new plant to churn out parts for offshore turbines on Friday, though the company said the move was “subject to final approvals from the U.K. government,” the Financial Times reported.

In the U.S., meanwhile, the Trump administration’s crackdown on offshore wind is so severe the oil industry is stepping in to complain, warning that it’s setting a dangerous precedent for other energy sectors, as I reported in this newsletter last week. But private actors are, at least, responding to the Trump administration’s push to re-shore critical industries to the U.S. On Monday morning, JPMorgan Chase announced plans to invest $10 billion into mineral production and infrastructure for artificial intelligence.

4. New York’s offshore wind project can’t secure a ship

Equinor’s 810-megawatt Empire Wind project off the coast of New York’s Long Island has faced real challenges, with the Trump administration halting construction in April before allowing it to resume in May. The latest hurdle? The developers can’t get hold of the specially-made vessel for installing wind turbines it was counting on having by next year. As Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler wrote on Friday, two shipbuilding companies broke into a public skirmish, with one unexpectedly canceling a contract and the other threatening legal action over the construction of the specialized ship. The vessel, which is more than 98% complete, is anchored in Singapore, its fate now uncertain. “We have been informed by Maersk of an issue concerning its contract with Seatrium related to the wind turbine installation vessel originally contracted by Empire Offshore Wind LLC for use in 2026,” an Equinor spokesperson told Fieseler. “We are currently assessing the implications of this issue and evaluating available options.”

The episode shows how the Trump administration’s “total war on wind power,” as Jael once put it, makes companies more vulnerable to other setbacks. The White House tasked a half-dozen federal agencies, as I previously wrote, with trying to block construction of offshore turbines. But the general lack of ships capable of carrying giant turbines was a problem even before Trump returned to office.

5. California lawmakers pass first-in-the-nation temperature standards

California lawmakers last week passed Senate Bill 655, a first-in-the-nation framework to set maximum standards for safe indoor temperatures in residential housing. The bill requires state agencies to achieve the standard as heat deaths surge across the country. While the state has long required homes to maintain a minimum indoor air temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit, there was no equivalent standard for heat. “SB 655 responds to the public health emergency of California’s deadly heat waves,” Senator Henry Stern, the bill’s lead author, said in a statement. “This bill proactively requires the state to include safe residential indoor temperatures in its policies and programs so that Californians, especially renters and low-income households who are most at risk, have life-saving cooling.”

It’s part of a bigger wave of state legislation on climate and energy that California just passed, as Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo outlined recently. Among them: Families who lose everything in future wildfires will now be able to collect the bulk of their insurance payout without having to catalog every item burned in the blaze under new legislation Governor Gavin Newsom signed Friday. Starting in 2026, as The New York Times reported, insurers must pay at least 60% of a homeowner’s personal-property coverage — up to $350,000 — without requiring a detailed inventory of everything lost. That’s double the 30% of the dwelling’s value that insurers were required to pay out in advance, with a payout capped at $250,000.

THE KICKER

As the Trump administration is gutting funding for America's polar research, the British are stepping in. The British Antarctic Survey’s RRS Sir David Attenborough, a state-of-the-art ship named after the famed naturalist, will bolster research on everything from “hunting underwater tsunamis” to tracking glacier melt and whale populations. “The saying goes 'what happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in Antarctica,’” BAS oceanographer Peter Davis told reporters during a tour of the vessel as it prepared to depart Harwich, eastern England, last week.

It’s puzzling, then, that the Trump administration is pouring vast government resources into saving aging coal plants and expediting advanced nuclear projects — two sources of energy that are famously financial black holes.

The Energy Department announced it would invest $625 million to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” in late September. Earlier this year, the agency also made $900 million available to “unlock commercial deployment of American-made small modular reactors.”

It’s hard to imagine what economic yardsticks would warrant funding to keep coal plants open. The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation. Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain. “You can put all the money you want into a clunker, but at the end of the day, it’s really old, and it’s just going to keep getting more expensive over time, even if you have a short term fix,” Michelle Solomon, a program manager at Energy Innovation who authored the research, told me.

Keeping these plants online — even if they only operate some of the time— inevitably raises electricity bills. That’s because in many of the country’s electricity markets, the cost of power on any given day is determined by the most expensive plant running. On a hot summer day when everyone’s air conditioners are working hard and the grid operator has to tell a coal plant to switch on to meet demand, every electron delivered in the region will suddenly cost the same as coal, even if it was generated essentially for free by the sun or wind.

The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability. In theory, coal generation should be available around the clock. But in reality, the plants aren’t necessarily up to the task — and not just because they’re old. Sandy Creek in Texas, which began operating in 2013 and is the newest coal plant in the country, experienced a major failure this past April and is now expected to stay offline until 2027, according to the region’s grid operator. In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing. This is in part due to wear and tear from the way these plants cycle on and off to accommodate renewable energy sources, the report said, but it’s also due to reduced maintenance as plant operators plan to retire the facilities.

“You can do the deferred maintenance. It might keep the plant operating for a bit longer, but at the end of the day, it’s still not going to be the most efficient source of energy, or the cheapest source of energy,” Solomon said.

The contradictions snowball from there. On September 30, the DOE opened a $525 million funding opportunity for coal plants titled “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” inviting coal-fired power plants that are scheduled for retirement before 2032 or in rural areas to apply for grants that will help keep them open. The grant paperwork states that grid capacity challenges “are especially acute in regions with constrained transmission and sustained load growth.” Two days later, however, as part of the agency’s mass termination of grants, it canceled more than $1.3 billion in awards from the Grid Deployment Office to upgrade and install new transmission lines to ease those constraints.

The new funding opportunity may ultimately just shuffle awards around from one coal plant to another, or put previously-awarded projects through the time-and-money-intensive process of reapplying for the same funding under a new name. Up to $350 million of the total will go to as many as five coal plants, with initial funding to restart closed plants or to modernize old ones, and later phases designated for carbon capture, utilization, and storage retrofits. The agency said it will use “unobligated” money from three programs that were part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program, the Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Projects, and the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas Program.

In a seeming act of cognitive dissonance, however, the agency has canceled awards for two coal-fired power plants that the Biden administration made under those same programs. One, a $6.5 million grant to Navajo Transitional Energy Company, a tribal-owned entity that owns a stake in New Mexico’s Four Corners Generating Station, would have funded a study to determine whether adding carbon capture and storage to the plant was economically viable. The other, a $50 million grant to TDA Research that would have helped the company validate its CCS technology at Dry Fork Station, a coal plant in Wyoming, was terminated in May.

Two more may be out the window. A new internal agency list of grants labeled “terminate” that circulated this week included an $8 million grant for the utility Duke Energy to evaluate the feasibility of capturing carbon from its Edwardsport plant in Indiana, and $350 million for Project Tundra, a carbon capture demonstration project at the Milton R. Young Station in North Dakota.

“It’s not internally consistent,” Jack Andreason Cavanaugh, a global fellow at the Columbia University’s Carbon Management Research Initiative, told me. “You’re canceling coal grants, but then you’re giving $630 million to keep them open. You’re also investing a ton of time and money into nuclear — which is great, to be clear — but these small modular reactors haven’t been deployed in the United States, and part of the reason is that they’re currently not economically viable.”

The closest any company has come thus far to deploying a small modular reactor in the U.S. is NuScale, a company that planned to build its first-of-a-kind reactors in Idaho and had secured agreements to sell the power to a group of public utilities in Utah. But between 2015, when it was first proposed, and late 2023, when it died, the project’s budget tripled from $3 billion to more than $9 billion, while its scale was reduced from 600 megawatts to 462 megawatts. Not all of that was inevitable — costs rose dramatically in the final few years due to inflation. The reason NuScale ultimately pulled out of the project is that the cost of electricity it generated was going to be too high for the market to bear.

It’s unclear how heavily the DOE will weigh project financials in the application process for the $900 million for nuclear reactors. In its funding announcement, it specified that the awards would be made “solely based on technical merit.” The agency’s official solicitation paperwork, however, names “financial viability” as one of the key review criteria. Regardless, the Trump administration appears to recognize the value in funding first-of-a-kind, risky technologies when it comes to nuclear, but is not applying the same standards to direct air capture or hydrogen plants.

I asked the Department of Energy to share the criteria it used in the project review process to determine economic viability. In response, spokesperson Ben Dietderich encouraged me to read Wright’s memorandum describing the review process from May. The memo outlines what types of documentation the agency will evaluate to reach a decision, but not the criteria for making that decision.

Solomon agreed that advanced nuclear might one day meet the grid’s growing power needs, but not anytime soon. “Hopefully in the long term, this technology does become a part of our electricity system. But certainly relying on it in the short term has real risks to electricity costs,” she said. “And also reliability, in the sense that the projects might not materialize.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc0NjUyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDY2MDAxM30.ZBRbtMYN-esFe2DVU3koTbGX1yj_yhOG8vWXgqQ71Gw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-14 09:00:49.160566

But there are big energy and environmental risks - WPSU,Michael Copley,,,,,https://radio.wpsu.org/2025-10-14/data-centers-are-booming-but-there-are-big-energy-and-environmental-risks,"Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information.
With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.
And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.
Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

GM reported the loss to the Securities and Exchange Commission as what's known as an impairment charge. Impairment charges reflect assets that are not expected to bring in profits as initially expected.

GM ""made significant investments and contractual commitments in the development of electric vehicles (EVs) to help the Company’s vehicle fleet comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly stringent,"" according to a company filing.

""Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,"" according to GM's filing. ""These developments have caused us to reassess our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint.""

GM executives have continued to call electrification the company's ""North Star."" But, along with other EV makers, the company has been shaken this year by Republicans' removal of a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers and lessees, as well as Trump's efforts to pull back federal rules limiting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.

GM more than doubled its electric vehicle sales in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, largely due to drivers hoping to take advantage of the tax credits before they expired Sept. 30. Analysts predict a steep drop-off in EV sales in the coming months.

Interest in EVs among U.S. drivers, while increasing, is also doing so at a far slower pace than many in the industry expected.

Without these incentives, it’s a general consensus that EV sales will drop in the coming months, effectively squashing the lofty goals that some U.S. automakers put in place three years ago that envisioned all-electric, zero-emission lineups of new cars and trucks over the next decade.

What is uncertain is how these changes might impact major employers that make up the EV supply chain, as companies such as Ultium Cells LLC in Lordstown keep a close watch on the market.

No Word Yet on Impact

“They don’t know what’s going to be in store in the future,” says George Goranitis, president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents hourly workers at Ultium’s sprawling plant.

The Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2021 during the Biden administration allowed qualified consumers to claim federal tax credits amounting to $7,500 toward the purchase of a new North American-manufactured EV sport utility vehicle with a price tag of $80,000 or less. The tax credit also covered sedans, hatchbacks, or crossovers with a sticker price of $55,000 or less. Those tax credits were set to expire at the end of 2032.

Instead, the Trump administration favored discontinuing the credits as of Sept. 30 under the budget reconciliation bill that passed Congress earlier this year.

Ultium – a joint venture between General Motors Co. and Korea-based LG Energy Solution – is among the Mahoning Valley’s largest employers, with approximately 2,200 salaried and hourly workers. The company manufactures battery cells used in several GM EV models, such as the Chevrolet Equinox, the GMC Hummer, and the Silverado.

The Equinox is an especially important end-user, since the vehicle is the No. 1-selling vehicle in GM’s EV portfolio. During the third quarter, GM reported that sales of Equinox EVs hit 25,085 units, a whopping 156.7% increase over the same period in 2024. Equinox EVs accounted for more than 25% of all 98,779 Equinox units sold during the period.

Goranitis says the plant is still very busy, spurred in part by record EV sales over the past two months. “With that $7,500 tax credit expiring, though, we’re not sure where we’re going to lie in the upcoming months,” he says.

More importantly, the Local 1112 president emphasizes there are no discussions of any layoffs at the plant. Still, there is a sense of uncertainty as to the health of the EV space.

“We’ve had good sales over the last two months, but there are just the unknowns with the tax credit being taken away,” Goranitis says. “All of the crews are working and making good quality cells for our customers,” he reports. “Hopefully, this month and within this quarter the EVs are still selling good.”

Ultium declined to comment at this time, according to a company spokesperson.

The New Normal

Some automakers have attempted to put in place incentives of their own to help offset the loss of the tax credits. According to a Reuters report Sept. 29, Ford Motor Co. and GM, for example, initially pushed out programs to retailers in which the manufacturer’s financing division would place down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory. These down payments would then qualify for the $7,500 tax credits, and dealers would then factor those credits into the lease rate.

However, these automakers abruptly backed off the programs after Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, and John Barrasso, R-Wyo., wrote a letter to U.S. Treasury Department Secretary John Bessent requesting that he close the tax credit loophole.

GM has said it would continue to offer a $7,500 discount without the credit until the end of October, while Ford said it would not use the tax credit but would maintain “competitive” lease payments.

Meanwhile, reactions from those customers who have purchased EVs are overwhelmingly positive, says David Sabolksy, general sales manager at Spitzer Chevrolet in North Jackson.

Sabolsky says that he’s been in the business since 1988, and he says he’s a pretty good judge when it comes to customer satisfaction or reactions to new products, and EVs have proved to be a great product. “I haven’t had one customer complain. Everyone that has purchased or leased one of these loved them,” he says.

Indeed, the rush for EVs during September was especially evident at Spitzer’s dealership on Mahoning Avenue. “At the end of the month, we sold out,” he says. “We had nothing left.” The Spitzer Auto Group also operates six additional Chevrolet stores in northeastern Ohio, and each of their showrooms were cleaned out of EVs, he says.

Fortunately, Sabolsky says the dealership has several new EVs on order, including some Chevrolet Blazers, Equinoxes, and Silverado pickups. “These are fantastic vehicles,” he says.

While it’s likely EV sales will take a hit with the loss of the tax credit, Sabolsky believes that the market will gradually rebuild as it attracts that specific niche customer. “It’s a very special buyer,” he says.

Others aren’t quite sold on the idea. Marquasha Moody, who owns a Ford Mustang Mach EV, says when it comes time to purchase a new vehicle, she’ll consider a plug-in hybrid, but not an EV again.

“Never,” she declares, after plugging her Mustang into a DC fast-charging station at a Sheetz station in Weathersfield Township. “There aren’t a whole lot of fast chargers around. This is the closest one to me, and it’s a half-hour away.”

Moreover, Moody drives an older, 2021 Mach EV model. While the vehicle is “so cool” and she likes it overall, she says it’s impractical for her driving habits. Plus, the battery capacity allows approximately 120 miles on a full charge. EV batteries on new models can travel more than 300 miles on a single charge. “If I have a gas/electric hybrid where I can switch back and forth, I’m fine with that,” she says.

Slow but Not Dead

Automakers and dealers had already anticipated the elimination of tax credits shortly after the new administration took office in January, says Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst for Edmunds. “We’ve been waiting for this to happen,” he says. “It wasn’t a matter of if, but when. I think automakers have had some time to think of contingency plans.”

Aside from Ford and GM’s programs, for example, Korean automaker Hyundai has announced that it would drop the retail price on some of its EV models to soften the impact.

Still, Yoon says it’s inevitable that EV sales will decline in the wake of the tax-credit rollback. “Despite the efforts of automakers, I wouldn’t be surprised of you see a slump in sales,” he says. This would especially impact a segment of the public that is wavering on whether to consider an EV, he says. Those who are undecided are less likely to adopt an EV without the help of a tax credit.

On the other hand, these tax credits were never meant to be permanent, Yoon says, and he emphasizes the incentives were intended to help stimulate adoption in an emerging industry in the United States as it developed.

What is heartening for the EV segment is that technology and development is accelerating at a rapid clip – reducing costs and improving efficiencies along the way, Yoon says. “For a lot of us, we’re used to seeing generational technology for gas cars change in the timeframe of five to 10 years,” he says. “Now, this stuff is happening in five to seven months. I think automakers are on track to get close to pricing parity sooner than we think.”

Yoon treats the disappearance of the tax credits as more of an inconvenience rather than a true hindrance to EV adoption in the long-term. “We might not get the full rollout we hoped for,” he acknowledges, “but the industry, whether the United States likes it or not, is on the slow march to electrification globally.”

That means manufacturers such as GM and Ford must manufacture electric vehicles in order to compete on the world scale, Yoon says. “It’s an inevitability,” he adds.

Public Transit

Meanwhile, efforts continue to develop an all-electric fleet for local public transportation, says Dean Harris, executive director of the Western Reserve Transit Authority, or WRTA. The organization plans to invest $5 million to transform its standard bus garage along Mahoning Avenue in Youngstown into a modernized building equipped with charging stations to initially accommodate 10 EV buses.

“We have eight big EV buses coming,” Harris says. Most likely, these new EVs will arrive sometime in the beginning for 2027, shortly after the new bus garage is finished, he says.

Harris says WRTA has four smaller EV transit vans on site, while its EV autonomous shuttle will be activated soon.

WRTA has said its ultimate objective is develop an all-electric fleet at its downtown location – an effort he considers challenging given the current funding environment.

“Our biggest concern is funding on the federal level,” he says. “The current administration – they’re not too keen on electric buses. It might take a little longer, so it’s slowing, but not dead.”",https://businessjournaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ultium2.png,N,,2025-10-14 09:00:58.821529

Increased Energy Requirements Data centers have the potential to cripple local power grids due to their extreme energy requirements.

The key, however, to successful and sustainable data center development is a comprehensive plan to address the issues associated with their operation.","The potential for another modern technological boom is beginning to look more like a reality as Americans become more dependent on electronic devices. Rises in the popularity of remote work, the increased use of AI in serious business practices, and continued demand for data storage all play a role in driving the need for increased tech capabilities.

To meet these ever-rising needs, infrastructure must be put in place to handle the physical requirements of data storage. In the state of Indiana, there are over 70 data centers either active, under construction, or proposed. It is clear these facilities are destined to become an increasing presence in American lives. They will create jobs, improve data security, increase internet speeds, and enable businesses to expand their technological capabilities.

Nationwide, the current administration has identified that the country is lacking progress in this regard and plans to change that. The U.S. Department of Energy has recently announced the next step in the Trump administration’s plan to usher in a “golden age for American technological dominance.” The plan to accelerate data center infrastructure development ensures economic growth and increases data security.

But as with all good things, there are potential negative factors to consider.

Water consumption, noise pollution, and increased energy requirements are just a few of the concerns shared by American households located in towns close to proposed data center sites. Those concerns have been voiced in Indiana as well. This brings to the forefront questions regarding how these new data centers can be made more sustainable and environmentally friendly, reducing their impact on local inhabitants.

Water Consumption

Data centers, like all electrical devices, create heat when in operation. This presents a cooling dilemma that must be addressed in order to keep the multitude of units within a data center operating correctly. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) estimates that larger data centers can use water in amounts totaling hundreds of millions of gallons a year. Minimal information is available on water consumption in data centers as less than half that currently operate in the United States utilize a comprehensive system for tracking water usage. Once a tracking requirement is put in place, and benchmarks are set, engineers will be able to develop plans which will make data centers more water efficient. Until tracking water consumption becomes an industry wide requirement, however, engineers can only formulate solutions based on estimates. One proposed solution involves heat dissipating layout plans where vented floors, combined heat exhaust areas, and higher ceilings will work to draw heat away from servers as efficiently as possible.

The World Economic Forum has also suggested the use of specialized cooling practices in order to relieve the stress on local water supplies involving reusing and recycling water in a closed-loop cooling system.

Noise Pollution

Noise pollution is another concern for residents regarding data centers. The cooling systems, generators, and ventilation fans of these facilities all create a significant noise footprint that can be harmful to humans and wildlife alike. In response to this issue, experts such as Josh Mahan of C&C Technology Group have begun to develop and propose noise reduction techniques to effectively reduce the sound produced by data centers.

These techniques include the use of soundproofing/acoustic treatments, cooling fan speed management, and alternative cooling solutions. Some companies are even exploring options for underwater data centers as both a cooling and noise reduction strategy. One factor that complicates the noise pollution issue is that there are no national standards for data center noise levels, and they are instead regulated by their applicable local ordinances.

Increased Energy Requirements

Data centers have the potential to cripple local power grids due to their extreme energy requirements. According to the EESI, the centers active within the United States in 2022 consumed around 17 gigawatts of power. This accounts for around 4.4% of the total energy used in the U.S. in 2022 EESI noted. The Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory’s report on data center energy usage predicts that the total energy requirement for data centers could reach almost 12% of the country’s total energy use by 2028. The U.S. Department of Energy has proposed and is working on solutions to combat this looming energy crisis by encouraging on sight power generation solutions, re-using retired coal facilities, and expediting their ultimate plan to “supercharge the electric grid.”

The development of data centers in the nation, and specifically in Indiana, will help drive forward growth and innovation in terms of expanding the capabilities and possibilities for business and industry.

New England’s final coal plant shuts down ahead of schedule

Even as the federal government attempts to prop up the waning coal industry, New England’s last coal-fired power plant has ceased operations three years ahead of its planned retirement date. The closure of the New Hampshire facility paves the way for its owner to press ahead with an initiative to transform the site into a clean energy complex including solar panels and battery storage systems.

“The end of coal is real, and it is here,” said Catherine Corkery, chapter director for Sierra Club New Hampshire. ​“We’re really excited about the next chapter.”

What do you do when you’re laying out all this good, corporate money for well-placed bribes, and then the Brib-ee bites you in the wallet? You mean you can still get stiffed? Looks like it. NextEra Energy builds and installs solar panels (YAY!) on an industrial scale. One project on their books was a spot in Nevada that would generate enough electric power for 2 million homes (impressive!). And just to seal the deal, they made a “generous contribution” to the Ballroom Blitz Defacement Project at the White House. BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE Dumb Donnie took the “contribution” (pronounced “bribe”) and has turned around and screwed the company, cancelling their big Nevada project. Not even trying to hide it anymore……

NextEra is also in on the nuclear power corporate grift, as noted above.

Why did Newsom veto California’s virtual-power-plant bills?

Supporters say the bills would have helped ease the state’s energy affordability crisis while strengthening grid reliability.

On Friday, Newsom vetoed AB 44, AB 740, and SB 541, which were passed by large majorities in the state legislature last month. Each bill proposed a distinct approach to expanding the state’s use of rooftop solar, backup batteries, electric vehicles, smart thermostats, and other customer-owned energy technologies.

In three separate statements, Newsom argued that the bills would complicate state regulators’ existing efforts to use those technologies to meet clean energy and grid reliability goals.

The moves come as utility costs reach crisis levels in California; its residents now pay roughly twice the U.S. average for their power.

VW Group Sales 2025","Global demand for several Volkswagen Group brands has given the company a modest boost through the first nine months of 2025, even as sales have softened in China and North America.

Thanks in part to growing interest in Skoda, Seat, and Cupra models, the group’s total sales reached 6,604,100 vehicles, marking a slight overall increase. Yet, not every nameplate in the portfolio is enjoying the same momentum.

The primary driver behind the 1.2 percent rise in total group sales is a 2.8 percent uptick in demand for Volkswagen-badged cars, climbing from 3,396,800 units to 3,492,500, a gain of 95,700. Skoda has matched that growth almost unit for unit.

This year, Skoda has delivered 765,700 vehicles, marking a 14.1 percent increase from the 671,300 sold last year, which equates to an additional 94,400 cars. The Czech brand’s third-quarter results were even stronger, with a 15.1 percent surge as sales grew from 222,700 to 256,300.

Demand for Seat and Cupra models is also trending upward. Combined sales from January to September rose 4.1 percent to 439,500, compared with 422,100 a year ago.

Luxury Brands Lose Ground

However, the news isn’t so positive for VW’s high-end brands. This year, Audi sales have slipped 4.8 percent to 1,175,800, well down from the 1,235,600 sold last year.

Similarly, Bentley sales have dropped 2 percent from 7,400 to 7,200, while Lamborghini deliveries fell 3.2 percent from 8,400 to 8,100. Porsche posted the steepest decline in the group’s luxury lineup, with sales down 6 percent to 212,500 from 226,000.

The biggest negative impact on the conglomerate’s total sales is in North America and China. This year, sales in North America have fallen from 769,000 to 708,800, representing a 7.8 percent decrease. China also saw a 4 percent reduction, falling from 2,056,600 to 1,974,000.

Elsewhere, the company continues to build momentum in electrified models. Battery-electric vehicle sales climbed 42 percent year over year, rising from 506,600 to 717,500 units. Growth was particularly strong in Europe, up 78 percent, and in the United States, where sales surged 85 percent. Plug-in hybrid deliveries also expanded by 55 percent, from 193,000 to 299,000.

Public Access Counselor Jennifer Ruby made her opinion-writing debut with repeated reminders of recent limits on her powers. Lawmakers in 2024 narrowed the source material for the non-binding opinions to the “plain text” of public access laws and valid Indiana court rulings.

Ruby’s first months in office were marked by complaints of nonresponsiveness. Gov. Mike Braun’s office said that had to tackle a sizable backlog before looking at the current year’s cases.

In her first opinion, issued Sept. 24, Ruby weighed in on a dispute between one Hoosier and the New Carlisle Town Council over economic development project records.

Complainant Debra Durall sought information about water use for Amazon’s data center project — such as nondisclosure agreements and communications between a flurry of parties — and any agreements or communications about the completion of an electric vehicle battery plant under construction by General Motors and Samsung SDI.

Durall sent the town a records request late last year, on Dec. 6. The town’s attorney offered up limited documents on Jan. 2. That included a blank NDA, because the town didn’t have the signed copies, and a redacted copy of a utility service agreement.

The town didn’t have other documents she requested — like those involving officials working for the county or chamber of commerce — and said it had no agreements with GM or Samsung. It withheld other communications, citing confidential attorney work, ongoing negotiations and trade secrets.

Durall filed a formal complaint with Ruby’s office Jan. 29.

Ruby opined that Indiana law doesn’t require governments to create records they don’t have to satisfy records requests. She also defended the redactions — noting statute protects a utility customer’s confidential personal information — and the withholding of the other confidential information.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, for instance, has found that utility customer water usage data can be a confidential trade secret.

“Although Indiana statute only allows the (Office of the Public Access Counselor) to consider public access statutes and case law when issuing advisory opinions, Indiana case law provides that the IURC can be given wide discretion in matters within its jurisdiction,” Ruby wrote. “Therefore, it seems reasonable for the OPAC to consider an IURC opinion when determining whether water usage information has the characteristics outlined by Indiana case law and qualifies as trade secrets.”

She issued an opinion saying the town didn’t break public records law.

Open door dispute

A second opinion, from Oct. 2, involved a township official seemingly iced out by his own colleagues.

Green Township Board Chair George Coffey accused Township Trustee Jon Fletcher of violating meeting access laws — by not telling him soon enough about a Dec. 19 meeting that the board’s other two members had called.

Hoosiers are entitled to notice at least 48 hours before a public agency’s governing body meets. In his Jan. 9 complaint, Coffey said board members usually were notified by email, but that this time, a letter arrived in the mail on the day of the meeting.

Fletcher defended himself in responses to Ruby’s office. He argued Coffey had emailed asking if there was a meeting and that the township attorney had responded Dec. 18 with the date and time. Fletcher also included a photograph showing the letters to all three board members were mailed Dec. 16.

Ruby noted that U.S. mail often takes three-plus for delivery. She argued that that Coffey “was at a disadvantage” — the other two board members knew about the meeting since they’d called it — and that only Coffey was left “in the dark.”

The photograph itself, she added, “leads our office to believe that Respondent knew that mailing the notice and agenda would be an issue.”

She wrote that it’s “unlikely” that the mailed letter or the township attorney’s emailed response were sufficient as written notice — but added, “As the statute is silent on the timeline and method of delivery for written notice … I decline to define ‘sufficient written notice.'”

Ruby opined that Fletcher didn’t violate open door law but that the conduct “violates the spirit of” Indiana Code’s provisions for ad hoc, special meetings. She recommended that the township trustee and board consider adopting a policy to ensure that all board members get consistent notice.

PAC settles in

The opinions represent two of 34 cases that Ruby has resolved as of last week, according to office spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland.

“Resolved is a fluid term,” McFarland noted. “… Some complaints may have been withdrawn, some may have been rejected due to jurisdiction or pending litigation, or the complainant may have received their request or no longer needs it.”

Open government group launching public access hotline, hopes to ease PAC workload

Hoosiers can find links to opinions on the agency’s website once they’re uploaded.

“Receiving and resolving complaints is an ongoing process, so please continue to visit the page above throughout the year for published opinions,” McFarland wrote.

Braun appointed Ruby to the role in late March, after former PAC Luke Britt, who ran the office for about 12 years under previous Govs. Mike Pence and Eric Holcomb, resigned.

“I’d always said that if I found that my voice was getting ineffective, it was time to leave. And that might have been my sign with that legislation,” he told WFYI at the time. House Enrolled Act 1338 also made the PAC serve “at the pleasure of the governor.” Before, one could only be fired “for cause.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/p5282173-1024x7681760451070.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=OeIwupms,N,,2025-10-14 12:14:58.093553

That’s the message that state officials from around the country are relaying to EPA. In comments on the agency’s proposal, officials argued that a patchwork of state regulations would be more expensive and less effective than keeping federal rules that limit pollution from cars and trucks.

But the alternative, they said, would be to blow a hole in state climate targets — and violate federal standards for safe air quality.

“Without reductions from vehicles, states must more and more aggressively squeeze emissions reductions from stationary sources or develop burdensome regulations of consumer products,” Minnesota state agencies wrote in comments to EPA’s proposal.

The Trump administration plans to stop regulating planet-warming pollution from cars and trucks, as part of its push to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding. The finding, which is the legal underpinning for most federal climate rules, states that greenhouse gases harm human health by driving climate change.

During EPA’s comment period for its proposal — which ended Sept. 22 — state officials urged the agency to reverse course. They pointed out that the only way to compensate for a retreat in federal vehicle standards would be to impose state-level regulations on other sectors of the economy.

Transportation is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gases. Vehicles are also a leading source of conventional pollutants that harm public health, and which states are required to control under the Clean Air Act.

EPA’s proposal would leave in place Biden-era standards for so-called criteria pollutants that contribute to ozone, particulate matter and air toxics. But it would jettison climate rules that would accelerate the shift toward electric vehicles — a transition that promised cuts in localized pollution.

“It is going to create more pollution, and it’s going to create fewer choices for states and locals to address that pollution unless they can figure out a way around what looks like a very high bar,” said Miles Keogh, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA).

“What it means is we’re going to get emission reductions wherever we have the authority to advance those clean air protections,” he said.

Air quality compliance at risk

States are required to submit plans to EPA for how they will meet the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants that harm public health — like ozone and particulate matter.

Those state implementation plans, or SIPs, detail how states will keep their pollution at or below EPA-approved limits. That task becomes harder as federal climate rules disappear — along with their co-benefits for local air pollution — and some regions see a baseline pollution spike.

Requiring states to offset the pollution previously abated by federal regulations amounts to an “unfunded mandate,” NACAA wrote in its comments to EPA.

“Various states have relied on the emission reductions provided by these federal standards to demonstrate future attainment of ozone and PM standards,” the group wrote. “The withdrawal of these standards would create a significant ‘gap’ and immediate compliance challenges for numerous nonattainment areas. States would be required to identify alternative emission reduction measures to maintain their approved implementation plans.”

The alternatives available to states, NACAA’s leaders wrote, “generally achieve emission reductions at higher per-ton costs and often face greater implementation challenges.”

A state could also lose federal highway funds if it fails to deliver on its implementation plan. That risk might be particularly acute for blue states like California under the Trump administration, which has shown a zeal for slashing federal funding to states that aren’t politically aligned with the president.

In February, EPA threatened to reject the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s plan to attain compliance with federal standards for ozone. The move — which EPA has deferred — could cost the Los Angeles region billions of dollars in federal highway funds.

The South Coast region has never been in compliance with ozone standards despite some of the toughest regulations in the country. In a February statement, the management district noted that more than 80 percent of the area’s smog-forming emissions come from motor vehicles, ships, planes and other sources the district has no regulatory authority over.

“Meeting national air quality standards is impossible unless these mobile source emissions under U.S. EPA authority are substantially reduced,” it stated.

Ann Carlson, director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA, said vehicle standards are the most effective way to bring Southern California in compliance with federal ozone standards.

“If they shut down all their stationary sources and they just said, ‘OK, you can no longer operate,’ we’d still be out of compliance standards,” she said.

Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have rescinded California’s waiver to implement its own vehicle standards — though that is still being litigated — at the same time as EPA moves to scrap its own clean car and truck rules.

“So at the same time they’re threatening to sanction [California], they’re also taking away the most effective tool California has to meet the standard,” said Carlson.

Some questioned whether the Trump administration — which has proposed loosening the NAAQS — would follow through on the lengthy process of rejecting a state’s plan and replacing it with a new abatement plan that would ultimately result in stronger limits on businesses.

“That sort of thing does happen from time to time, but it’s a long process. EPA can’t come down like a ton of bricks,” said Michael Gerrard, faculty director at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “EPA can’t automatically jump in and require further action. Obviously, the current EPA wouldn’t anyway.”

But future EPAs might.

John Graham, a senior scientist at the Clean Air Task Force, noted that the history of the NAAQs shows that pollution limits tend to tighten over time as epidemiological studies show that lower and lower concentrations of pollutants harm public health. That could mean new parts of the country become out of compliance.

“If that standard is likely to change in the next three decades, which it could very well do, then these rules become even more important,” he said.

In response to questions, EPA issued a statement saying the agency is “following all of its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act.”

Even if Trump’s EPA doesn’t impose sanctions on states and localities that fail to meet the NAAQS standards, citizens or nonprofits can still sue states for noncompliance. Activists are already signaling they’ll use litigation as a backstop to protect public health and the climate if EPA repeals the endangerment finding and vehicle standards.

“To the extent EPA is not doing [enforcement], I can guarantee that others will be,” said Greg Cunningham, vice president for clean energy and climate change at the Conservation Law Foundation.

‘Near zero’ chance of hitting climate goals

State commenters questioned whether they could scrape together enough emissions cuts to make up the difference if EPA gets rid of its greenhouse gas rules.

In Oregon, where state law requires deep emissions cuts by 2050, officials said federal vehicle standards had allowed the state to decarbonize while still growing the economy. Trying to achieve the same result through state regulations, they said, would harm the state’s growth for a fraction of the benefits.

“Without federal greenhouse gas emissions standards, Oregon would be left with a patchwork of state-level policies that cannot achieve the same extent of reductions in emissions,” Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Director Leah Feldon wrote in comments to EPA.

“Removing these standards would make it far more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the state’s legally binding emission reduction targets,” she wrote.

In Washington state, where a cap-and-invest system covers the state’s biggest polluters, some officials warned that state law would force the state to balance a rise in vehicle pollution by clamping down on other, nontransportation sectors. But state agencies expect to get less juice from the squeeze.

“The federal standards are already not stringent enough to meet Washington’s greenhouse gas limits — in this scenario, if they are repealed as proposed, our ability to meet our limits would be near zero,” Washington state agencies wrote to EPA.

North Carolina officials warned that worsening air pollution would have “severe consequences” for public health as well as the state’s economic competitiveness.

“One of the first questions corporations ask when they are evaluating the location of a manufacturing facility in the state is if the area in which they are evaluating complies with all the NAAQS,” wrote Michael Abraczinskas, director of the Division of Air Quality at the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

“For Mecklenburg County and adjacent counties, we are proud to say that, yes, the area complies with all the NAAQS, and we intend to keep it that way,” he wrote.

Turning to stationary sources

States and regional authorities can’t regulate mobile sources directly — at least, not unless the courts ultimately overturn EPA’s repeal of California’s waiver.

But there are new strategies states and local regulatory authorities may pursue to limit vehicle emissions indirectly.

EPA last year allowed the South Coast regional authority to include its “indirect source rule” for warehouses in California’s state implementation plan to decrease nitrogen oxides and particulates. Warehouses — like rail yards and ports — are hubs for high-emitting long-haul trucks that spew criteria and climate pollution. The rule requires warehouses to formulate plans to reduce overall emissions via installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure, limiting trips by diesel-burning trucks and other options.

It’s less efficient than fleetwide vehicle emissions standards, and more costly for warehouse owners. But its a strategy states and regional authorities may use to limit pollution at other warehouses, rail yards and ports around the country. And while EPA had to sign off on adding it to California’s SIP, states and regional authorities don’t require federal permission to regulate local infrastructure.

States also have wide leeway to electrify their own fleets of government vehicles. Subsidizing EVs, building charging stations and other incentives also remain available.

The Clean Air Act allows states to regulate stationary sources, like manufacturing, oil and gas development and power generation. But that’s complicated by tight electricity demand, high prices and public concern about the economy.

“States can impose all kinds of requirements on their stationary sources,” Gerrard said. “But often that’ll chase companies out of town, and cause electric rates to go up and lots of other bad things that states want to avoid.”

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, filed comments urging EPA not to repeal the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. While the draft rule doesn’t directly undo Biden-era power plant carbon rules, EPA is working separately to roll those back.

EEI noted that repealing the scientific finding would leave the power sector unregulated for climate change at the federal level.

But it would do nothing to roll back state climate laws.

“Many EEI members serve customers in states with existing state policies for [greenhouse gas] emissions,” wrote EEI regulatory lead Alex Bond. Those policies are already shaping those companies’ investments, he said.

“Settled” federal standards would do more to lessen regulatory uncertainty, he said, than a regulatory void at the federal level that would be filled with “competing and conflicting regulations through a patchwork of state regulations.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/82/36/f10385374e98a4fd127a56c8e8c8/california-gas-appliances-66606.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 08:02:47.528033

The Detroit automaker Tuesday morning in a public filing said $1.2 billion of the impact will be non-cash, special charges as a result of adjustments to its EV capacity. The other $400 million in cash is primarily related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments, according to the filing.

The automaker said its reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing footprint is ""ongoing,"" signaling additional charges could be announced for future quarters.

The charges will be reported as special items when GM reports its third quarter results on Oct. 21. That means they will impact the automaker's net results but not its adjusted earnings, or EBIT-adjusted, which are closely watched by Wall Street.

GM was among the earliest to invest billions of dollars in an EV market that didn't culminate. At one point, the company was planning to invest $30 billion by this year in EVs, including dozens of new models and capacity for battery production.

The charges come amid changing regulations regarding EVs — particularly the end of $7,500 in federal tax credits — under the Trump administration as compared to President Joe Biden, who championed the vehicles.

""Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,"" GM said in the filing.

John Murphy, a longtime analyst with Bank of America, warned earlier this year of such write-downs for automakers that invested heavily in EVs.

""There's a lot of tough decisions that are going to need to be made,"" Murphy, who's now with Haig Partners, said in June during an event for Bank of America's ""Car Wars"" report. ""Based on the study, I think we're going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.""

GM's EV pullback charges come more than a year after crosstown rival Ford Motor announced a $1.9 billion impact from its EV plans.

Ford's included about $400 million for the write-down of manufacturing assets, as well as additional expenses and cash expenditures of up to $1.5 billion that included canceling a large, electric three-row SUV that was already far in development and delaying production of its next-generation electric full-size pickup truck.

GM, which offers the most EV models in the U.S., has made significant gains this year in EV sales, but the size of the market is niche compared with expectations at the beginning of this decade.

Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share in all-electric vehicles to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September.

Chinese manufacturer BYD serves as a prominent case study in this technological transformation, using AI-powered systems to underpin its rapid global expansion and solidify its position in competitive markets like the United Kingdom.

This approach has supported BYD’s growth from producing 500,000 vehicles in 2017 to a projected four million by 2024.

BYD's performance in the UK, where it sold 11,271 vehicles in September, a substantial increase from the 1,150 units in the same month last year, could show the effectiveness of its strategy. This growth has given BYD a 3.6% market share in the UK.

""We want to see steady growth, and we want people to see we are a technology company,"" says Bono Ge, Country Manager for the UK & Ireland at BYD. Bono has also stated BYD's intention to introduce its ultrafast charging technology to the UK and Europe next year.

AI-powered quality control

A key factor in BYD's manufacturing process is the extensive deployment of AI for quality control, particularly in battery production.

BYD has reported a 40% reduction in battery defects and a 20% improvement in average battery lifespan.

These gains are attributed to AI-powered systems that analyse real-time sensor data from production lines.

This strategy extends to the development of bespoke AI hardware. BYD's subsidiary BYD Semiconductor is creating AI chips designed to compete with offerings from Nvidia and Horizon.

These chips reportedly achieve 80 trillion operations per second, potentially moving BYD closer to purely domestic production.

To support this, BYD has also partnered with semiconductor manufacturers TSMC and MediaTek to develop a 4-nanometre smart cockpit chip.

An internal analysis of the firm’s manufacturing processes suggests that ""a BYD car comparable to the Model 3 costs 15% less than production in Tesla's Shanghai gigafactory.""

Data ecosystem and intelligent driving

Beyond the factory floor, AI is integral to the vehicles themselves. In February, BYD launched its ‘Intelligent Driving for All’ initiative, which equips all new vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems as standard.

The strategy uses the ‘God's Eye’ system, a three-tiered platform that is deployed across all vehicle price points.

This approach differs from competitors like Tesla, whose Full Self-Driving system is an optional extra. By making these features standard, BYD can gather vast amounts of data from its entire fleet.

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations.
Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate.","Google recently courted the township of Franklin, Ind., so that it could construct a giant campus to house the computer hardware that powers its internet business. But the company needed to rezone more than 450 acres in the Indianapolis suburb, and residents weren't having it.

Many were concerned the facility would consume huge amounts of water and electricity while delivering few local benefits. When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents.

Similar fights are happening around the United States. On one side are companies pouring billions of dollars into data centers, which increasingly are being built to support artificial intelligence models that promise to transform how people live and work. On the other side are residents who worry the construction spree will have dire consequences for the environment, power prices and surrounding communities.

How tech companies and government officials handle those concerns will shape the industry's future in the U.S. and the country's competitiveness, according to analysts and academics who track the AI industry.

Local opposition ""slowing down the development of the industry or distributing it in sort of weird regional patterns is probably the most overlooked potential outcome in this conversation,"" says Joseph Majkut, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Here's what you need to know about the data center and AI boom — and what's at stake.

What are data centers?

Data centers are big buildings that house computer hardware to store and process digital information. They essentially function as the backbone of the internet. Some of the largest cover more than a million square feet — the size of more than 17 football fields.

When you read this story, or send an email or transfer money from your bank account online, you're relying on data centers scattered around the world.

And that computing power has a big environmental footprint. A typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). They also suck up billions of gallons of water for systems to keep all that computer hardware cool.

Why am I hearing so much about data centers right now?

Data centers have been around for decades. But there's an investment frenzy around AI right now that's fueling a construction boom.

That growth is being driven by AI investors seeking enormous profits, thanks to the rising interest in AI from individual consumers and businesses. Within two years of ChatGPT's launch in 2022, for example, around 40% of households in the U.S. and United Kingdom reported using AI chatbots, according to the IEA. Roughly the same share of large companies were using AI last year, up from around 15% in 2020, the agency said.

Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and AI computer chips. They're betting that more people and businesses will use the technology in the future. By 2027, AI is expected to account for 28% of the global data center market, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double its current share.

Where are data centers being built?

With money flooding in, developers are flocking to areas where a lot of data centers are already, like Northern Virginia's Data Center Alley and parts of Texas, according to the IEA. But the agency said there are also signs that development is spreading into other markets, like Las Vegas, that offer affordable land, cheap electricity from renewable power plants and industry tax incentives.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said this month that ""a potential data center boom is just getting started"" in its district, which covers Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It definitely feels like we are starting to see the rollout of what these massive investments in data centers are potentially going to start to look like on the ground,"" says Melissa Scanlan, director of the Center for Water Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

What are the benefits of AI?

Artificial intelligence generally refers to computer systems that learn to carry out tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, like reasoning and decision-making, according to NASA.

Some AI is being used to make images and videos online. The IEA says it's also being deployed in the medical field, to rapidly map protein structures for drug development; in the energy industry to quickly detect pipeline leaks and manage electricity networks; and in weather forecasting, to produce more accurate outlooks.

To remain competitive, the U.S. needs to be able to respond to what the market demands, whether it's ""more AI in the form of robotics, or we want much more in the form of digital services to make professionals more productive,"" says Majkut of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then there's a variety of applications in the national security, cybersecurity realm where the U.S. having a strong lead in the best [AI] models, the best chips, I think, is also something we want to pursue.""

Does it matter if the data centers that train and run those AI models are located in the U.S.? There are certainly potential economic benefits, like construction jobs and local tax revenue. But some localities are giving up a portion of those payments by offering tax breaks to lure project developers.

""Because much of the upfront investment is about physical infrastructure, having that investment here is hugely beneficial to the American economy,"" says Andrew Chien, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. The challenge for communities is figuring out how to turn those initial investments into long-term benefits, Chien adds, like high-paying jobs.

Since it doesn't take many people to operate a data center, once they're built, the facilities don't usually support many permanent jobs.

What's driving the local pushback against data centers?

Some people don't want huge industrial facilities — and all the noise and light that comes with them — changing the character of their community.

But people are also concerned about data centers depleting local water supplies for their cooling systems, driving up electricity bills and worsening climate change if the facilities rely on fossil fuel power plants for the electricity they need. The IEA says climate pollution from the power plants that run data centers could more than double by 2035.

Consider what's happening around the Great Lakes, where Scanlan of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says there's a flurry of data center activity. The Great Lakes can be thought of as ""a giant pitcher of water with straws going into it"" from water utilities, business and power plants in eight states and two Canadian provinces, Scanlan says. The question is, how much more water can the lakes provide for data centers and the power plants needed to run them in the coming years?

In Georgia, some residents reported problems getting drinking water from their wells after a data center was built nearby. And in Arizona, some cities have restricted water deliveries to facilities that use a lot of water, including data centers.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, says companies have been working to reduce how much water their facilities consume. While some data centers use evaporative cooling systems in which water is lost as steam, others rely on closed-loop systems that use less water. A Google data center in Georgia uses treated wastewater for cooling and then returns it to the Chattahoochee River, Diorio said. And there's a push for waterless cooling systems.

""It's a balance between water and electricity,"" Diorio says. ""If you use more electricity to cool, you're going to use less water. If you use more water, you'll use less electricity.""

Rising electricity bills are also a major concern as data centers spike power demand in certain areas. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists recently found that in 2024, homes and businesses in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia faced $4.3 billion in additional costs from transmission projects that were needed to deliver power to data centers.

Diorio says the data center industry ""is fully committed to paying its full cost of service for electricity.""

Data centers aren't the only source of new power demand. The construction of factories and increased sales of electric vehicles and home appliances like electric stoves are also increasing the country's electricity needs.

Compounding the concerns of data centers' environmental and economic impacts is frustration that tech companies aren't forthcoming about their operations. Without more transparency around water and energy consumption, Scanlan says the public doesn't have the information it needs to make informed decisions about data center development.

Diorio says data center companies are trying to be ""responsible partners"" in the communities where they operate. But they sometimes worry that sharing information about their water and energy use could give rivals a competitive edge.

Are there other challenges to data center development?

The big challenge is having enough electricity to meet rising demand.

The Trump administration has been taking steps to limit development of renewable energy projects. Industry executives and analysts say renewables are crucial to boost power supplies because the projects can be built quickly, and they generate electricity that is relatively cheap.

Pavan Venkatakrishnan, an infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress, says there's a ""clear conflict"" between the administration's position on renewables and its desire to accelerate data center construction.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said in a statement that AI ""cannot be beholden to unreliable sources of energy that must be heavily subsidized to be economical. The Trump administration is focused on unleashing the forms of energy — from natural gas to nuclear — that do work and that do not need consistent government subsidies to power the next Golden Age for America.""

Solar and wind power coupled with large batteries to store electricity are reliable power sources. There's also widespread agreement among energy analysts and executives that natural gas and nuclear will play an important role in meeting new electricity demand. But they say those technologies can't be deployed quickly enough at scale right now to meet the country's immediate needs.

OAK ISLAND, N.C.—Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.

But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens within a family of chemicals that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.

Donovan felt devastated and enraged.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”

In 2013, scientists first discovered seven different types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several public utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.

The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians.

It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators and local residents, started urging the EPA and state officials to regulate the compounds.

Many activists went to Congress and to the courts. Clean Cape Fear even pleaded its case to United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”

Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found PFAS in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs and beer. Pine needles, honey and house dust. Landfills, compost, and sewage sludge.

Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water.”

— Emily Donovan, Clean Cape Fear

Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.

The celebration was brief.

Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin—with support from the chemical industry—began dismantling those hard-won protections.

And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

2013-2016: A Movement Is Born

The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.

On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was releasing PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.

Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction, and environmental engineering at N.C. State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”

Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.

Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.

Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.

“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”

The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing and playing in contaminated water.

As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.

We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.

When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.

Then a freelance reporter for the Wilmington Star-News, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings.

People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.

“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”

2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear

Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.

She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.

In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.

The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.

In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.

Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA, and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.

2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature

Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr. is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.

Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.

Yet after a contentious commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another one.

Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”

Davis, who became the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.

Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.

Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: a $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.

“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”

2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer

Brian Long, the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.

It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.

“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”

EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the liver, kidneys and immune system.

Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer.

Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.

New Hanover and Brunswick counties had some of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in North Carolina, according to the state cancer registry. Rates of testicular cancer were also significantly elevated in nearby Pender County, which later detected high levels of PFAS in its drinking water.

Several advocates felt illnesses in their family might be linked to PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.

Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, who had been diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.

Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.

She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”

One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.

“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.

The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”

2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal

Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:

Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin.

Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.

Steer the tired alligator to the bank.

Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).

Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.

Burdette helped NC State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators can live long lives in contaminated water, so they can serve as models for detecting human health problems.

The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 types of PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.

“It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up.”

— Dana Sargent

It had been more than a year since the contamination became public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.

Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.

“We sued,” Burdette said.

SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act.

By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.

“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”

By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.

No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.

DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.

“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”

In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.

“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”

Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.

“It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction.”

— Geoff Gisler, former SELC senior attorney

“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”

At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.

“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”

Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”

Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.

2021-2022: Quest for Accountability

One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.

Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.

Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. NC State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.

In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.

“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”

The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.

In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.

The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.

2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers

Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.

Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA, and environmental advocates were becoming impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.

He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion, and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.

Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.

“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”

Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.

“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”

Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.

Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”

Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.

“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“

The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $2 billion to help utilities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, but that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.

In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.

Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.

Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.

May 2025: The Persistent Republican

It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.

“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”

Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.

If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.

“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”

A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.

“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”

Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.

“You can make all the PFAS you want, but you can’t release it into the environment.”

— Rep. Ted Davis Jr.

The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.

Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.

“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”

With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.

2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained

A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.

The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.

Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at NC State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.

Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.

After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.

“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.

“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”

June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill

Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.

A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”

“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”

The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.

Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.

Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.

The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.

September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX Rollback

In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.

“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”

The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it did so out of sequence.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.

Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period, during which over more than 120,000 comments were submitted—including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.

The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.

Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized the standards simultaneously, instead of moving through each action separately. This, Zeldin argued, “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator. We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

— Emily Donovan, Clean Cape Fear

A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”

Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.

The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.

“Chemours is using this as their basis for saying the science is flawed,” she said. “That’s ridiculous.”

The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.

However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.

EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.

More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.

It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.

“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”

The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties.

This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing; of those, state records show nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.

JOSHUA: We’re three weeks from Election Day, and Mikie Sherrill’s focusing on driving down costs and making our state more affordability. She’s also making the strong case we can’t afford someone in the Governor’s Office who’ll let Donald Trump make life worse for New Jerseyans.

On the other hand, Jack Ciattarrelli’s closing argument is focused on a). Saying Trump is amazing, b). Mikie maybe, mighta, kinda done something he’s not sure about at the Naval Academy over 40 years ago, and c). Suing Mikie because he didn’t really kill thousands of people…he only made millions of dollars off their opioid abuse, pain and suffering. Do I have that, right, Jeanette?

JEANETTE: Nice try there! Jack’s campaign continues to build momentum from all corners of the state. He was just endorsed by yet another Democrat mayor, North Bergen’s Nick Sacco, and the list keeps growing. I can’t name one Republican who’s endorsed Mikie Sherrill…maybe Tammy Murphy?

At last week’s debate, Mikie looked incredibly defensive regarding her naval academy record – which her story’s changed about several times now. And how she illegally traded stocks while on the House Armed Services Committee in Congress, profiting off of her public service to the tune of $7 million.

Worse, Mikie came completely unhinged, making crazy claims Jack somehow murdered tens of thousands of people through his publishing company, which was sponsored by academic grants of major public universities. This jaw-dropping moment was the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever seen in a debate. Frankly, I couldn’t believe someone of Mikie’s stature, who served in the military and Congress, would make this disgusting and demonstrably false statement. Reporters called it wildly reckless – even for Jersey standards…and that’s saying something.

I know debates get heated, but this is serious. Mikie must be held accountable for her actions, particularly at a time when political violence is so prevalent. It’s no surprise Jack is rightfully bringing forth a defamation lawsuit.

JOSHUA: At the debate, I thought it was bananas for Jack to say he’d give Trump’s second term an “A” grade. His rationale of “I think he’s right about everything that he’s doing” is bonkers. Moreover, as a campaign tactic, it won’t endear him to the independent voters he needs to stand a chance.

But, let’s both get out of the gutter here. Let’s get back to the issue that matters most to the voters…affordability.

JEANETTE: Sounds good!

JOSHUA: By far, Mikie’s best day on the campaign trail was announcing her plan to declare a State of Emergency on utility costs. Sherrill showed voters she understands what’s keeping them up at night and how she’ll take bold steps to make things better. On Day One, she’ll immediately freeze rising energy rates.

JEANETTE: Let’s be clear. You and I both see the bills that come in our mailbox. Every single New Jersey family’s getting crushed by skyrocketing energy prices thanks to Phil Murphy’s disastrous Energy Master Plan.

Jack’s the only candidate with a serious plan to LOWER energy bills. Mikie’s “rate freeze” – which even Governor Murphy says is illegitimate – will lock in the ridiculously high costs we’ve already been paying, not lower them.

JOSHUA: Let’s point fingers in the right place. It’s not sexy – and even people closely following politics/policy don’t totally know what it is – but a lot of fault for utility prices is laid at the feet of PJM. They’re the electric grid’s air-traffic controller. PJM’s board really has no one representing customers. It’s all power plant owners and others looking to profit.

And while we’re pointing fingers, remember it was Chris Christie – not Murphy – who closed some Jersey power plants. Ciattarelli should look at the last Republican governor if looking to cast blame. The same way he should look to Trump, who promised to slash the cost-of-living for Americans – particularly energy prices.

JEANETTE: Once again, New Jersey Democrats want to nationalize this race because they don’t want to talk about their miserable record on this issue.

JOSHUA: Hold your horses, Jeanette…I’d think Jack would want to nationalize this race…You know, he said he’d give Trump an “A” grade and all.

JEANETTE: Funny, Joshua…but you can’t ignore the laws of supply and demand. Democrats are trying to make it a complicated issue, but it’s not. A decade ago, New Jersey was an energy exporter. After eight years of Murphy dumping billions of dollars in off-shore wind, which never came to fruition, and his quixotic quest for “clean” energy by 2035, we now have an energy shortfall and are forced to import our energy (mostly fossil fuels) from other states, at higher prices.

As part of their unrealistic green agenda, the Murphy Administration fought and blocked access to new natural gas pipelines and infrastructure upgrades and completely ignored nuclear, which is a clean, affordable, reliable energy source.

Jack will take New Jersey out of RGGI – which is a waste of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and doesn’t make our environment any cleaner. He’ll invest in natural gas, nuclear, and solar, while making sure we have a strong, stable, and reliable energy supply.

JOSHUA: Well, I’m voting for the woman who’ll usher in cleaner, cheaper energy to drive down bills…create good-paying jobs…require more transparency from utility companies. And stand up to Trump.

But, you know what, Jeanette, I think we’re out of time. There’s still so much to go over. Don’t worry, we’ll pick up this energy conversation next week….when I’m sure to be talking about how Trump’s ridiculous war on clean energy is poised to cause New Jersey to lose out on 10,000 jobs over the next 5 years. And how Trump, Ciattarelli and MAGA Republicans support regressive policies just to give massive tax breaks to oil and gas billionaires.

JEANETTE: While I’ll be talking about Jack’s common-sense New Jersey plan to get back to affordable, reliable, and secure energy by increasing our supply.

And I’ll probably still be talking about how Mikie proved she doesn’t have the character, temperament, or judgment to be our next Governor.

Maybe I’ll even let you get the last word next time.",https://images.roi-nj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hoffman-Henne-article-image-3.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 08:01:47.749920

Apple is significantly expanding its clean energy projects across Europe with new large-scale solar and wind farms now in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Romania. Together with a newly operational solar array in Spain, the projects announced today — all enabled by Apple — will add 650 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to electrical grids across Europe in the coming years, unlocking more than $600 million in financing. This will generate over 1 million megawatt-hours of clean electricity on behalf of Apple users by 2030.

As part of the company’s Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is enabling renewable projects to address the electricity European customers use to power and charge their Apple devices. By 2030, Apple plans to match 100 percent of global customer electricity use with clean electricity by bringing new wind and solar power online around the world. The growing portfolio in Europe marks a significant step toward that goal.

“By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies, and secure energy sources across the continent.”

Product use — the energy it takes to charge and power Apple devices — accounted for about 29 percent of Apple’s overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2024. To address these emissions, Apple supports renewable energy projects that maximize impact on grids around the world, aiming to avoid the carbon that’s emitted by charging and powering Apple devices. The company’s strategy to address these emissions accounts for where Apple products are used, while aiming to protect communities and biodiversity, and prioritizing projects in grids that currently have higher carbon intensity.

Across Europe, Apple is facilitating the construction of large-scale projects that will add around 3,000 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy to the grid each year by 2030. In Greece, the company has signed a long-term agreement to procure power from a 110MW solar project owned and operated by HELLENiQ ENERGY. Now fully operational, the project will support Greece’s transition to renewable energy. In Italy, Apple is supporting the development of a 129MW portfolio of solar and wind projects. The first project — a solar project in Sicily — will come online this month.

In Poland — home to one of the most carbon-intensive grids on the continent — Apple has enabled Econergy’s 40MW solar array, which will be operational later this year. Apple also plans to procure power from Nala Renewables’ 99MW wind farm in Romania’s Galați County through a long-term agreement originated by OX2, which is now constructing the project. And in Latvia, Apple has signed one of the country’s first corporate power purchase agreements with European Energy. Through the long-term deal, Apple will procure electricity from one of Latvia’s largest solar farms to date, which will add 110 MW of clean power capacity to the grid once complete. Apple also enabled the development of a 131MW solar farm developed by ib vogt in Segovia, Spain. The project became operational earlier this year.

As Apple progresses toward its 2030 goal, the company is working to enable renewable energy projects around the world. In addition to investments for product use, Apple and its suppliers support over 19 gigawatts of renewable used to power the company’s global corporate operations and manufacturing supply chain.

None of the utilities in question — AES Indiana, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Indiana, Indiana Michigan Power (I&M)and The Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) — found themselves with a better score in the report's most recent iteration than in years past.

Scores were awarded on a scale of 1 to 100, largely based on whether utilities are retiring coal plants by 2030, not building new gas plants through 2035, and how the utility’s plan transitioned toward clean energy, also by 2035.

Indiana’s utilities largely did not fare well against these standards.

A spokesperson from Duke Indiana said the utility’s “utmost obligation” is to provide reliable and low-cost energy to customers, which can get tricky when renewable sources, like wind and solar, are weather dependent.

Still, Megan Anderson, a senior organizer with the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign said she’s worried that utilities are keeping aging coal plants online and building new natural gas plants in response to an upcoming data center boom. If the boom doesn’t happen on the predicted scale or if the centers quickly become more data efficient, she worries that ratepayers will be stuck with the burden of maintenance and repairs for coal plants long past their prime.

Pollution from coal plants remains a major concern for the Sierra Club. Even when utilities meet environmental regulations, which continue to be rolled back, people can still suffer, according to Nicole Chandler, who also works on the Beyond Coal campaign. In her opinion, meeting these regulations should just be the beginning.

“That’s the minimum,” she said. “People are still being harmed by what's happening in these fenceline communities from the pollution.”

When air pollution in the form of health of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and mercury spew from fossil fuel burning power plants, the health of communities living nearby are at risk, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Sierra Club’s report demonstrates that state and federal desires to keep the coal industry afloat is reflected in local utility decision making. But despite President Donald Trump administration’s tirade against renewable energy, Indiana utilities are pursuing an “all of the above” approach to solve the precarious future of Indiana’s energy needs. Coal is staying online, natural gas is being built and renewables are here to stay.

Here's how each utility stacked up in the Sierra Club's report.

AES Indiana

AES tied for Indiana’s highest utility score, with a 57%. The Sierra Club cited AES’s interest in building two new gas burning power plants to serve big customers, like data centers, in their explanation for the score.

Mallory Duncan, a spokesperson for AES, wrote in a statement that the utility has not filed any plans for such plants, adding that future development would comply with state and federal regulations.

She added the utility will also likely be the state’s first investor-owned utility to go coal-free, and it has invested widely in renewable energy like wind and solar. AES is also paving the way forward in Indiana with construction of battery storage systems, which can store energy from wind and solar to be discharged after the sun sets or wind calms.

CenterPoint Energy

CenterPoint Energy’s score took a hit this year, earning a 33%.

The utility is in the middle of writing its next Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which is a long-term guide map for energy generation, and the drafts show the utility heading in a new direction.

CenterPoint’s last report planned to retire all coal generation by 2023. The Sierra Club noted that now, drafts of the updated IRP show the utility retaining coal past 2030.

Noah Stubbs, a spokesperson for CenterPoint Energy, wrote in an email to IndyStar that the Sierra Club’s report “does not fully reflect the broad set of considerations utilities must weigh today, including rising resource costs, shifting federal incentives and evolving environmental regulations.”

He added that 70% of the company’s coal fleet has been retired or exited since the Integrated Resource Plan. CenterPoint also has plans for 1.1 GW of new generation by 2026, over half of which Stubbs said will be sourced from renewable energy projects.

Duke Indiana

The Sierra Club awarded Duke a 0% this year, which is the same score it received in the organization’s last report.

Duke was initially planning to close its Gibson County coal plant in 2035, but the utility extended its life by three years, much to the ire of clean energy advocates, according to reporting from WFYI. Duke also proposed new natural gas plants, like in Vermillion County, Indiana, and the Sierra Club noted the utility has ditched plans to build out renewable energy. Almost 3,798 megawatts of renewable energy investments that were cut dropped from its long-term energy plan, according to the report.

Angeline Protogere, a spokesperson for Duke, wrote in an email to IndyStar that MISO, the agency running the energy market across most of Indiana, lowered the values assigned to renewable generation, which was an “important driver” in how they planned energy generation.

“We have to demonstrate that we have enough generation to serve our customers’ needs in every season,” said Protogere.

I&M

I&Mslid from a 66% last year to a 48% in 2025. The Sierra Club cited costs from coal plants being shifted solely onto Indiana customers.

Stephanie Smith, a spokesperson from I&M, stressed that the utility’s energy mix is designed to provide safe, reliable and clean power customers can count on around the clock in a statement. This mix includes fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, but also emission-free energy generation from nuclear, wind, solar and battery storage.

NIPSCO

After receiving an 80% last year, NIPSCO earned a 57% in 2025, tying with AES for top marks.

As for the drop, the Sierra Club cited NIPSCO’s plans for new gas plant. Jessica Cantarelli, a spokesperson for NIPSCO, explained that while the utility committed to protecting human health and the environment, NIPSCO has to ensure reliability — a common theme across the Indiana utilities struggling to balance clean energy and dependability.

The nearly two-week old shutdown that’s led to furloughs of thousands of federal workers hinges in part over looming expiration of an enhanced premium tax credit for health plans purchased on exchanges created by the Obama-era health care law.

But other bipartisan tax credits are also expiring. Their backers hope a year-end deal averts those cliffs but acknowledge the dearth of trust between the parties amid the shutdown bodes poorly.

“I’ll work with anybody on legislation that’s good for the American people and my district,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee’s tax subcommittee who co-sponsored a permanent extension of the race car break. “But this does kind of sour the soup.”

Extenders Left Behind

Congress has perennially passed what’s known as an extenders package, renewing mostly bipartisan expired and expiring tax breaks. Many of these, such as the expired credit for American Samoan tuna canneries, were left out of Republicans’ July mega law, leaving their fate to the whims of lawmakers considering a raft of issues in bipartisan legislation before the calendar turns.

Partisan rancor endures after Republicans enacted their tax law using maneuvers to sidestep Democrats, and the White House rescinded already appropriated federal funds.

Popular support for each extender break individually may be insufficient to overcome that strife, said Ray Beeman, who leads EY’s Washington Council practice.

Because lawmakers’ terms aren’t expiring this year, they may feel that waiting until 2026 and extending the breaks retroactively is more attractive, Beeman said. The funding lapse has also fractured the attention of lawmakers and their staff, dimming the prospects of planning a package.

“At least, while there’s a shutdown, I just don’t think anybody’s super focused on” other extenders, Beeman said.

There’s been little, if any, substantial negotiation over a year-end package.

Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the ranking member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters his discussions with Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) about such a deal have been minimal.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said he “will work with anybody to try to find common ground.” But he dinged the panel’s chair, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) for skipping a committee debate and vote on Republicans’ tax law despite his calls for “regular order.”

Spokespeople for Smith and Crapo did not return requests for comment.

The House last year passed a $78 billion bipartisan business and child tax break bill and a year later voted to create treaty-like tax benefits to firms operating in Taiwan. That’s giving some lawmakers reason to think an extenders deal is possible.

“We’ve shown that even in a pretty hyperpartisan environment, we were able to come together,” said Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), a senior member of the Ways and Means and Budget committees.

Employer, Film Studio Tax Breaks

One extender at stake is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which benefits employers who hire veterans, felons, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups. Smucker is pushing for an expansion of that bonus, arguing it ends up saving money as workers contribute to the Treasury.

The ability of film and TV studios, theaters, and sound recording studios to quickly write off their expenses also faces expiration. Lobbyists for the entertainment industry have sought to extend a long-standing benefit that allows such productions to immediately take advantage of depreciation rules that would normally have to wait for their work to premiere to claim.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hopes to include her bill extending that break in any tax package that materializes this year, according to a spokesperson. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), who has co-sponsored her bill, also wants to get it across the finish line.

“I disagree with her on almost everything, but here we finding a way to sing from the same song sheet,” he said.

Tax writers representing motorsports speedways are also hoping to preserve the tax treatment of race tracks used by operators big and small, including NASCAR.

“If any bill has a tax title, you see if you can insert it into the larger package,” said Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who represents the home of the Indy 500. “I’m imagining it’ll be a year-end play.”

Speedway operations don’t qualify for the taxpayer subsidies that other major league sports often get, and the industry is hoping they can avoid an expiration or at least apply the break retroactively next year so they stay on a level playing field with amusement parks and golf courses.

“The only thing that makes me feel good is that we’ve been in these positions before,” said Dean Aguillen, a principal at OGR who lobbies for the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States, the trade association for the motorsports industry.

Thompson, who has co-sponsored the House companion to Young’s motorsports bill, too hopes it can be included in a year-end package.

But he said hasn’t talked with his Republican colleagues about a broader package as the House remains in recess amid the shutdown.

“I just walked the halls this morning, can’t find a single one,” Thompson said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/6f9b989/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3994x1539+3+356/resize/960x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2F25%2Fef1344864aa4b11e5ffa7d366415%2F430123371.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 12:12:05.181042

The client for both projects is Ecopetrol, Colombia’s state-owned oil company, which holds significant influence in the local energy sector.

Deepening the Latin American Market, Fulfilling a Green Mission

As the fourth-largest economy in Latin America, the Colombian government places high importance on its energy transition and has identified solar power as a key development focus. According to the national plan, Colombia aims to achieve a 6 GW solar PV installation target within the next three years and strives to increase the share of renewable energy to 30% by 2030. Driven by both policy guidance and investment support, Colombia’s PV market is experiencing rapid growth.

Against this backdrop, Clenergy’s PV mounting solutions have facilitated the implementation of the 23 MW La Fiercal and the 1.8 MW Providencia Island ground-mounted PV projects in Colombia. These projects are of great significance for optimizing Colombia’s energy structure, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and promoting green, low-carbon development.

Customized Solutions Empowering Complex Scenarios

Clenergy consistently adheres to a dual-drive development strategy of “localized service + technological innovation.” While expanding its overseas markets, the company conducts in-depth research into the geographical features, climatic conditions, and actual customer needs of target regions. Focusing on technological innovation, Clenergy continuously iterates and upgrades its solutions, committed to providing highly adaptable PV mounting solutions.

Addressing the environmental challenges in parts of Colombia, such as complex terrain, high temperature and humidity in coastal areas, and high corrosion risks, both projects utilized Clenergy’s versatile SolarTerrace MAC ground-mounted PV mounting solutions and products.

This product utilizes new ZAM (Zn-Al-Mg) steel, which offers excellent corrosion resistance, enabling stable performance even in extreme environments characterized by high heat, humidity, and sandstorms. The system features a flexible and adaptable installation structure, suitable for regions with different wind load requirements. Its easy installation saves time and labor costs, opening new avenues for reducing costs and increasing efficiency in ground-mounted power plants.

La Fiercal 23 MW Ground-Mounted PV Project

As the first PV project within a refinery complex in Latin America, the La Fiercal project holds landmark significance. Upon operation, the project will supply 34.29 GWh of clean energy annually to the Cartagena Refinery, injecting green power into industrial operations.

Providencia Island 1.8 MW Ground-Mounted PV Project

Providencia Island was severely damaged by a hurricane, leading to extensive infrastructure destruction. To accelerate post-disaster reconstruction and improve the local energy supply situation, the Colombian government initiated the PV project on the island. The island faces not only the threat of hurricanes but also, due to its coastal location, a permanently high-corrosion C5-class environment.

Confronting this dual challenge, Clenergy selected high-corrosion-resistant ZAM material for the mounting structures and enhanced their stability and durability under extreme hurricane conditions through optimized structural design. The completion and operation of the project effectively optimize the island’s energy structure, significantly improve power supply reliability, and provide a clean electricity guarantee for local reconstruction and sustainable development.

Looking ahead, Clenergy remains committed to technological innovation and service upgrades, collaborating with global partners to jointly promote the high-quality development of the global PV industry and contribute technological strength to the worldwide energy transition and sustainable development.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 10:01:10.652469

Environmental justice advocates, Garcia said, may have to talk differently and be increasingly careful with language.
Terms like “environmental justice” and “climate change,” have become so politicized that they can stop conversations even before they begin.
Environmental justice addressed those same concerns, she said, with a focus on those most impacted, namely low-income communities and people of color.
In 2022, a national program, the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights was born.","As a child, Lisa Garcia spent her summers in a South Bronx where playgrounds had more cracked pavement and asphalt than grass. She biked or hung out on stoops with her friends. She considered herself outdoorsy, even if the outdoors looked a little different in the working class neighborhood of Soundview.

“Literally no one I grew up with knew that there was actually a Bronx River,” Garcia said. “When we were growing up, the Bronx River was a parkland.”

The 24-mile waterway—New York City’s only freshwater stream—runs beneath the Bruckner Expressway and Sheridan Boulevard and parallel to the Bronx Parkway. Back then, few children knew it was there. Fewer went near it. Green spaces were squeezed in pockets between concrete. Garcia, who was asthmatic, remembers the air as acrid with exhaust that triggered some painful coughing fits.

Only much much later did she learn that there likely was a connection between her health and her Bronx surroundings.

Garcia, 58, has spent nearly three decades fighting for environmental justice in the courts and through laws and regulations that ensure the right to live in safe, healthy environments with equal protections. At the Environmental Protection Agency, she served in the Biden administration as administrator for Region 2, covering New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and eight Native Nations.

Before that, she served as associate administrator and senior advisor to EPA Administrators Lisa P. Jackson and Gina McCarthy during the Obama administration and focused on environmental justice planning, helping build widely available online maps that showed, block by block, where pollution and people overlap.

Now environmental justice is under attack. President Trump’s administration has taken a torch to the EPA website, eradicating what Garcia, among others, built to encourage more investigation and public participation in environmental protections. Garcia, too, was part of the upheaval: she was among the political appointees in the Biden Administration who resigned in January after the November election.

“When you take the job as a political appointee, you know in four years you may be out of a job,” Garcia said. Still, the last few months of the Trump era have been disorienting. “What I did not foresee is the complete dismantling of the work and the disrespect for the workers.”

It might be time for the fight for environmental justice to take a different approach—or adopt different ways to get more communities on board, she said.

How to do that keeps her up at night, Garcia said. How can activists hope to incorporate environmental justice into government entities now? What practices make the most sense, what lessons were learned, and, how can she offer new ways to help people compile evidence and facts? People still live in polluted, unhealthy neighborhoods. People are still getting sick. People still need to know that there are laws and regulations that should be protecting them, she said.

Environmental justice advocates, Garcia said, may have to talk differently and be increasingly careful with language. Terms like “environmental justice” and “climate change,” have become so politicized that they can stop conversations even before they begin.

Keeping the conversations on shared health risks and benefits may be the answer. “It’s not over,” Garcia said over a cup of coffee in Union Square, laying out the need for remediation for industrial pollution still troubling many low-income neighborhoods.

Garcia said she first considered environmental justice when she was a student in Spain, attending law school in 1999. Garcia, an avid international traveler and fluent in Spanish, was initially drawn to human rights, but an environmental law class changed that. Human rights and environmental law became inseparable in her mind.

Not long after, Garcia began to think back to her childhood asthma and the exhaust that drifted through Soundview. It was her “ah-ha,” moment. Since then, Garcia’s career has shifted between government and nonprofit work. She said she is most satisfied “in the trenches” with people, including five years working for EarthJustice, the public interest law organization.

“Environmental justice” crystallized as a concept in the late 1980s, and the movement gained national attention when residents in Warren County, North Carolina, protested a proposed landfill that would be designated as a dump for products laden with polychlorinated biphenyl. PCB is a manmade chemical used in fire retardants and some adhesives and plastics that is banned in many countries as a toxin.

Republican President Richard Nixon had created the EPA years earlier, in part from public demand–and legal challenges—to regulate pollution in the air and in waterways. Environmental justice addressed those same concerns, she said, with a focus on those most impacted, namely low-income communities and people of color.

The rationale was simple and rooted in equity. “Why not have everyone have parks, clean air and clean water to swim in?” she said.

There were decades of progress under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Garcia helped create “Plan EJ 2014,” under President Barack Obama, which was the first strategic plan for weaving environmental justice throughout EPA funding and projects.

She worked with colleagues to embed environmental justice criteria in launching EJSCREEN publicly in 2015, so that anyone could type in a ZIP code to add to the growing sets of data. But in January, in the first week of the second Trump presidency, all bets were off. The EJSCREEN tool is gone now. That part of the website doesn’t exist.

“There’s a certain pride that we must have been doing something right when we created EJSCREEN if the Trump administration feels like you can’t even have access to it,” Garcia said, smiling. Experts had the foresight to take screenshots before the site went dark. “A lot of it is preserved. It’ll be static, but at least it’s not lost completely.”

Trump’s administration has gutted most broad protections and, within weeks, revoked any prior executive orders involving environmental justice. When Trump signed executive order 14151, “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” EPA funding was no longer assured for existing programs. The next month, he cancelled pivotal environmental and climate block grants worth $3 billion.

Garcia said these actions shouldn’t have been so easy to do. And the administration’s decision to fire EPA staff and cut federal funding for programs, she said, is a step backward. A clean and healthy environment is a goal that should not be controversial, she said.

Garcia said Trump, in his first presidency, did not target the EPA so aggressively, and many safeguards and programs survived. But the Biden administration took a different approach from an Obama-era EPA, she said, by creating a separate office to prioritize environmental justice. In 2022, a national program, the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights was born.

For the first time, there was a lot of money and over 200 people at the EPA dedicated to the movement. That too now is gone. The Trump administration was “able to destroy it,” she said.

Still, post-EPA, Garcia continues to pivot through the challenges. Today she continues her work through lecturing at both Columbia University and New York University, on environmental law. She’s also working on a project to improve New York State’s watershed program, and still attends hearings held by the former White House Environmental Justice Environment Committee.

She doesn’t plan on stopping her work any time soon, despite all the pivoting. The federal government has stepped away, but grassroots environmental justice leaders are still on the ground across the country and able to make change, Garcia said. She only has to look around her old neighborhood to know that there is strength in numbers.

In the Bronx, the once-ignored river of her childhood now is supported by the Bronx River Alliance, which publishes newsletters and sponsors events for residents to learn more about its vast natural resource.

The river once known as the “open sewer” choked with car parts and garbage is now home to herring, oysters, blue crabs, and beavers populations. People come out and kayak near the restored wetlands on sunny days.

In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency recommended stricter limits after new research showed mussels, snails and other aquatic life are more sensitive to ammonia than previously understood.

""EPA included additional species in its calculations, and the new recommendations are stricter than what's in our current regulations,"" said Mike Kruse, environmental program manager for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' Watershed Protection Section. ""We're proposing to adopt those standards to better protect aquatic life in Missouri streams and lakes.""

Unlike a single fixed number, ammonia criteria typically use formulas that vary depending on factors such as pH, or water temperature. Missouri regulators plan to calculate limits by using region-specific standards.

Kruse said the impact will be felt most by small rural communities that rely on lagoon systems, which were not designed to treat ammonia at the stricter levels. ""Upgrading them would mean essentially rebuilding the treatment plant,"" he said. ""For small communities with shrinking populations, that's a pretty significant cost.""

To ease the transition, the state is offering variances — temporary exceptions that let facilities show the highest level of treatment they can realistically achieve and request more time to comply with the new federal standards. Larger city plants must also meet the new requirements, but their infrastructure is better-equipped to handle the changes without major upgrades, Kruse said.

The DNRC held an open house this week to guide community representatives through the variance application process. Additional sessions are planned in the coming months.

The Philippines’ leading cold-storage operator, Mets, has partnered with First Gen Corp., the country’s largest geothermal energy supplier, to power the energy-intensive sector with renewable energy, seeking both cost savings and lower emissions.

Cold storage expansion meets energy transition goals

Under the agreement signed on Oct. 3, Mets will source up to 2.05 MW of electricity from the Mount Apo Geothermal Power Plant, operated by Energy Development Corp. (EDC), a subsidiary of First Gen Corp. The renewable supply will cover the company’s current power needs and support its planned expansion.

The facility, with a storage capacity of over 7,100 metric tons, is part of Mets’ growing nationwide cold-chain network.

“This partnership with First Gen allows us to ensure a stable power supply for our cold-storage facilities while supporting our goal of using clean, renewable energy,” said Donna Robles, Mets’ Chief Operating Officer.

A key player in the Philippines’ cold-storage and logistics market, Mets offers temperature-controlled warehousing, blast freezing, and toll-processing services, providing more than 100,000 pallet positions across its network. The company secured a USD 120 million investment last year to fund its expansion plans.

The country’s cold-chain industry is projected to grow to USD 1.5 billion by 2026 and reach USD 1.7 billion by 2027, fueled by rising demand from the food, pharmaceutical, and logistics sectors. As energy costs climb, operators are increasingly turning to renewable sources to cut expenses and strengthen sustainability credentials.

Geothermal capacity scales up in the Philippines and the region

“Clean and reliable power is vital for cold-storage operations that keep food and medicine safe,” said Arlene Sy-Soriano, Assistant Vice President at First Gen Corp. “This collaboration with Mets Cold Storage underscores how geothermal energy can enhance both sustainability and reliability in the cold-chain sector.”

The partnership also reflects First Gen’s broader strategy to expand its geothermal leadership both domestically and overseas. The company operates 13 integrated geothermal power plants with a total capacity of 1,200 MW, along with hydro, solar, and wind assets with a combined capacity of more than 400 MW.

To accelerate the energy transition, First Gen plans to invest around USD 20 billion over the next five years to expand its power portfolio to 13 GW, both in the Philippines and overseas. Its regional ambitions are underscored by a USD 2 billion joint geothermal project in Indonesia, which aims to build six power plants with a total capacity of 440 MW.

The Philippines ranks as the world’s third-largest geothermal power producer, behind the U.S. and Indonesia, with an installed capacity of approximately 1.9 GW, accounting for 14.6% of the national electricity mix.

The experience of other countries suggests that after the cancellation of benefits, the electric vehicle market may go through a period of stagnation before resuming growth thanks to technological improvements and cost reduction.","Impact of Government Incentives on the Market

Despite talks about market forces, it was government incentives that played a key role in popularizing electric vehicles. This is particularly noticeable towards the end of September, when federal tax credits officially expired. According to research firm Rho Motion, up to 90% of all battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids sold in the US received some form of tax benefit during the first nine months of the year.

Sales Surge Before the Deadline

The expiration of the federal electric vehicle tax credit on October 1st provoked a national rush for relevant models. This led to record sales for a number of brands and increased overall demand for electric cars in August and September. This year, the Environmental Protection Agency determined that 20 battery electric vehicles and one plug-in hybrid model met the criteria for the new clean vehicle credit worth up to $7,500. Together, these cars accounted for 55% of all electric car sales from January to September.

Leasing Loopholes and Fleet Support

A less known Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, also worth up to $7,500, played an important role in supporting sales. This credit was available for vehicles weighing up to 14,000 pounds and was intended for fleets and business buyers. It also allowed automakers to claim the tax credit themselves and reduce the cost of leasing new models. Importantly, leased passenger cars were not subject to the same origin and assembly requirements as purchased ones, and they did not need to be produced in North America, making leasing a particularly attractive option.

Results Before Benefits Expired

As the September 30th credit expiration date approached, electric vehicle sales surged sharply across the United States. Ford sold 30,612 battery electric vehicles in the third quarter, which is 86% more than in the second quarter. GM’s electric car sales increased by 44% to 66,501 units, Tesla reported a 27% sales increase, and Hyundai also noted significant growth thanks to doubled demand for the Ioniq 5.

Prospects Without Incentives

It remains unclear how sharply electric vehicle sales will decline in the fourth quarter after tax credits expire. Rho Motion expects demand to “sharply decrease.” The research firm also points out that tariffs, high costs of local production, and weakened fuel efficiency standards will likely restrain investments in domestic electric vehicle production, creating additional pressure on demand in the coming months.

The expiration of tax benefits may become a test for automakers, who now must adapt to market conditions without significant government support. Some companies have already announced their own sales incentive programs, but their effectiveness remains questionable. The experience of other countries suggests that after the cancellation of benefits, the electric vehicle market may go through a period of stagnation before resuming growth thanks to technological improvements and cost reduction.",https://topgir.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kia-2026_ev4-copy-1024x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 09:01:25.176354

From powering homes to fueling businesses, reliable and affordable energy keeps America moving forward. But today, outdated permitting rules are blocking the very projects we need to secure our future. Regulations that were designed to provide a fair process have turned into roadblocks. Instead of delivering better outcomes, they now drive up costs, stall job creation and leave families footing the bill.

On average, major energy projects take more than six years to secure approval. Some transmission lines have been delayed as long as seventeen years. During that time, demand keeps rising, infrastructure keeps aging and costs keep climbing. Transmission congestion alone costs American families $11.5 billion in 2023. Those costs show up in monthly utility bills and in lost opportunities for new jobs and investment.

Every state feels these challenges. In the Southeast, families have watched their power bills surge nearly 24% for households and 19% across all sectors in just the past decade. Families and businesses are paying more, while projects that could deliver cleaner, cheaper power are stuck in line. The result is a system where energy consumers pay the price of government inaction.

Permitting delays no longer make projects safer or cleaner. They simply make them more expensive and less certain. Developers spend years navigating duplicative reviews and endless litigation, often without a clear end in sight. This uncertainty discourages investment, slows innovation and means fewer new projects break ground. At the same time, consumers lose out on the lower costs and greater reliability that come when competition and new supply are allowed to flourish. Dominion Energy projects a $14 to $37 monthly increase in customer bills by 2040 due to rising generation and transmission costs. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy).

The stakes are only getting higher as energy demand is growing rapidly. In Virginia, peak load is expected to rise between 0.3% to 5.7% annually, driven by expanding industries like data centers, advanced manufacturing and electric vehicles that are adding new load to an already strained grid. Without timely upgrades to transmission and generation, costs will rise, reliability will suffer and our ability to compete globally will weaken. We can’t afford to let red tape hold us back.

That’s why permitting reform is essential. A smarter, more predictable system would:

Set clear timelines so reviews can’t drag on for years without resolution.

Reduce duplication by designating a single lead agency to oversee major projects.

Focus reviews on major projects while letting routine, low-impact ones move quickly.

Prevent endless lawsuits by establishing fair but limited opportunities for judicial review.

These reforms won’t weaken environmental protections. They’ll simply make the process work. Americans deserve both strong environmental stewardship and an energy system that is affordable, reliable and secure. With clearer rules and faster decisions, we can have both.

Permitting reform is about more than paperwork. It’s about lowering costs for families. It’s about creating jobs through new projects and infrastructure. And it’s about strengthening America’s energy independence so we’re never at the mercy of foreign supply chains or aging infrastructure.

We’ve always been a nation that builds. From railroads to highways to pipelines, our infrastructure has powered our growth and secured our future. But today, the greatest obstacle to building isn’t technology or resources, it’s bureaucracy. Red tape is holding America back at the exact moment when we need to unleash our full energy potential.

By cutting through the gridlock and modernizing our permitting system, Congress can deliver real results: affordable electricity, reliable power, secure supply and new jobs. Families want it, businesses need it and our future depends on it.

Permitting reform is not just a policy debate; it’s a national necessity. The time to act is now. Let’s fix permitting, unleash American energy and secure a stronger future for every state.

Backed by its parent group, Vingroup, one of Southeast Asia's largest private enterprises, VinFast is not simply focused on car production. Instead, the company is taking a long-term, systemic approach to green mobility, building what it calls a fully integrated industrial ecosystem, one that connects materials, energy, mobility, and digital services under a single, sustainable framework.

Green Steel: The Strategic Backbone of Self-Reliance

The latest step to solidify that ecosystem is VinMetal, a new high-tech steel manufacturer announced recently. With an initial annual capacity of five million tons, VinMetal is designed to produce green steel that will directly supply VinFast's electric vehicle assembly lines.

At first glance, a steel plant may not sound revolutionary. But for Vingroup, it is a strategic move to strengthen the backbone of its industrial operations. Green steel production will not only reduce dependency on global supply chains but also lower carbon emissions, two critical challenges facing EV manufacturers worldwide.

Nguyễn Việt Quang, Vice Chairman and CEO of Vingroup and concurrently CEO of VinMetal, stated: ""VinMetal is not just a steel plant. It represents a strategic preparation for a modern, green, and sustainable infrastructure future for Vietnam. At Vingroup, we believe that proactively developing foundational industries will help our country enter a new growth era, where Vietnamese people master technology, materials, and the execution of national-scale projects.""

The pursuit of vertical integration, from the foundational steel to the sophisticated software, marks a distinct departure from the lean manufacturing model favored by most established automakers and even many emerging competitors.

Of course, this also speaks to something greater, VinFast is backed by the comprehensive and steadfast support of Vingroup, a corporation defined by its bold vision and mission.

For VinFast, controlling the supply chain means controlling quality, cost, and ultimately, the pace of innovation. This bold strategy for production self-sufficiency is not an academic exercise. It is the direct prerequisite for the automaker to confidently launch its products into challenging international markets, especially the United States, where quality resilience and cost transparency are non-negotiable.

VinFast's Strategy for the U.S. Market

In the United States, VinFast's lineup centers around two key SUV models: the elegantly designed VF 8 and the spacious, three-row VF 9. Both are engineered to meet the evolving needs of modern American consumers, where a blend of practicality, advanced technology, and a focus on safety is paramount.

The VF 8, a five-passenger mid-size SUV, is positioned as a versatile vehicle for daily commutes and weekend getaways. Meanwhile, the VF 9 tackles the demands of larger families or long-distance travelers, focusing on generous space and premium comfort features to make electric driving effortless and enjoyable.

VinFast's strategy for the U.S. market is built around a clear mission: to make premium electric mobility more accessible. The company is attempting to erode the traditional barrier of high upfront costs by offering inclusive pricing, flexible financing, and attractive lease programs.

For example, VF 8 lease programs start as low as $279 per month under certain promotional offers, with qualified customers potentially enjoying 0% APR financing options.

Crucially, VinFast's commitment to quality is underscored by its warranty policy: 10 years or 125,000 miles for the vehicle, and an industry-leading 10-year unlimited-mileage warranty for the battery. Amid market anxiety over battery durability, this commitment sends a strong, confident message about the company's engineering quality.

Digital Connection and Confidence on Every Journey

Understanding that range anxiety remains a key consideration for many first-time EV owners, VinFast has prioritized convenience and connectivity. VinFast vehicles are fully compatible with America's rapidly growing public charging infrastructure.

Through the VinFast app, owners can easily locate nearby chargers, monitor charging progress, and plan efficient routes, all from their smartphones. This seamless digital experience reflects the company's broader philosophy: ensuring that the transition to sustainable mobility is as effortless and reassuring as possible.

Moreover, recognizing the effectiveness of its dealer-based sales strategy, VinFast has accelerated the expansion of its dealership network across the United States. Each partner is carefully selected for proven capability, industry experience, strong reputation, and deep local insight. This approach enables VinFast to deliver high-quality products and exceptional service to a broader customer base, while ensuring sustainable, well-optimized growth and strengthening the brand's presence nationwide.

Instead of a V10 monster, we got something totally different, and arguably even more important. Meet the Toyota Corolla Concept, teased ahead of its full debut at the Japan Mobility Show on October 29.

At first glance, this thing doesn’t scream “concept.” It looks way too production-ready with actual, albeit razor-thin side mirrors, realistic proportions, and that signature Toyota restraint under all the bold new lines. But look a little closer, and there’s something really interesting going on.

The Electric Gospel According to Toyota

See that fuel cap on the front fender? That’s not where you’d expect it on a gas-powered car. That’s usually a sign of a charging port, meaning this could be the first-ever all-electric Corolla. It’s technically possible it’s a plug-in hybrid, but Toyota already has the Prius handling that job. So this might be the clean-sheet EV version everyone’s been waiting for, or possibly even make it available for markets where the Prius is absent.

Still, knowing Toyota, they’re not about to abandon combustion engines anytime soon. The Corolla is the best-selling nameplate in history, and Toyota has made it clear they think EVs aren’t the one-size-fits-all solution, continuing to spread their version of the Hybrid EV gospel. So, expect both an EV and an ICE version sharing this new look, one platform, two powertrains.

Toyota Finally Having Fun?

Design-wise, this is easily the boldest Corolla we’ve ever seen. The pixel-style DRLs, sloping roofline, and that ducktail spoiler give it a futuristic but familiar feel.

The federal $7,500 EV tax credit expired on September 30, ending a key incentive that had fueled sales and investment across the auto industry.

The Trump administration’s decision to let the program lapse is part of its broader rollback of clean-energy subsidies. Industry leaders warn the shift could slow adoption and weaken U.S. competitiveness in the global EV market.

GM drops lease workaround

General Motors confirmed on October 8 that it abandoned a plan to capture remaining tax credits through dealer leases after criticism from lawmakers and legal experts. The company’s finance arm had planned to buy EVs from dealer inventory before the deadline, claim the credits, and pass savings on to customers.

GM now says it will fund lease incentives internally through October. Ford has not disclosed if it will pursue a similar approach.

Tesla raises lease prices and trims costs

Following the loss of the tax credit, Tesla raised U.S. lease rates for all models. Monthly payments for the Model Y now range from $529 to $599, and the Model 3 from $429 to $759, according to Reuters.

To maintain affordability, Tesla launched new “Standard” versions of both vehicles with fewer features and shorter range. Analysts say the move shows how deeply the tax credit had shaped EV pricing.

Honda halts Acura EV as demand weakens

Honda Motor Co. has discontinued its Acura ZDX electric crossover, built at GM’s Spring Hill, Tennessee plant. The company cited low demand and plans to shift to its in-house RSX EV platform by 2026.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy is reviewing more than $1.1 billion in grants previously awarded to GMand Stellantis for EV production. If rescinded, the funding cuts could delay major plant expansions.

States continue to push forward

While federal support ends, several states are expanding their own incentive programs. California, New York, and Connecticut continue to promote EV adoption. Connecticut recently raised its CHEAPR rebate to as much as $4,000 for new battery EVs.

Globally, China’s BYD and Europe’s Volkswagen Group are increasing output with strong policy backing, further pressuring U.S. automakers.

The road ahead

Analysts expect EV sales in the U.S. to decline in 2026 before stabilizing later in the decade. Automakers are turning to hybrids and plug-in hybrids to balance costs and consumer demand.

This significant positive momentum is largely attributed to a confluence of robust economic drivers, including ambitious reshoring initiatives, unprecedented infrastructure spending, and the accelerating global energy transition. At the forefront of this industrial resurgence is GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), whose stock performance has topped the market, signaling strong investor confidence in companies poised to capitalize on these transformative trends.

The sector's impressive showing today underscores a deeper narrative of industrial revitalization in the United States. With a year-to-date gain of 14.5% for the S&P 500 Industrials sector, and an even more striking 26.75% for an equal-weighted index by late September 2025, the market is clearly signaling a bullish outlook. Investors are increasingly drawn to the sector's resilience and its direct ties to strategic national priorities, making its sustained growth a compelling story for both retail and institutional portfolios.

Unpacking the Industrial Surge: A Confluence of Catalysts

The strong performance of the Industrials sector is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several powerful economic and policy tailwinds. A primary driver is the pervasive trend of reshoring and onshoring initiatives, as companies seek to mitigate geopolitical risks and enhance supply chain resilience by bringing manufacturing back to domestic soil. Government policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the CHIPS Act are providing substantial incentives and creating immense demand for new factories, construction services, and logistics infrastructure. This legislative support is directly translating into increased industrial production and capital expenditures.

Furthermore, a monumental infrastructure spending boom is channeling significant investments into transportation networks, energy grids, and digital infrastructure across the nation. This sustained government outlay directly benefits companies supplying construction materials, engineering expertise, and heavy equipment, providing a predictable and long-term revenue stream for the sector. Simultaneously, the accelerating energy transition and electrification drive, intensified by the soaring electricity demands of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is creating unprecedented opportunities for industrial firms specializing in power generation, renewable energy components, and grid modernization. Companies that are enabling this shift are seeing their order books swell.

Adding to this positive environment are easing inflation concerns and a more accommodating monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, including expected interest rate cuts in 2025. Lower borrowing costs stimulate corporate investment in expansion and upgrades, directly benefiting industrial equipment manufacturers and service providers. This resurgence is further bolstered by a renewed focus on manufacturing and automation, with advanced technologies like AI and robotics enhancing productivity and profitability across the sector. The aging global aerospace fleet also contributes to consistent demand for parts, maintenance, and new aircraft, providing a steady revenue stream for aerospace and defense players.

Winners and Losers: Navigating the Industrial Landscape

The current industrial renaissance is creating clear winners, with companies strategically positioned to benefit from the aforementioned trends. GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) stands out as a prime example, having demonstrated exceptional growth since its spin-off from General Electric in April 2024. Focused exclusively on power generation and grid equipment, its valuation has skyrocketed from $37 billion to $156 billion, with an impressive 97.31% year-to-date stock rally by today's close. Its leadership in gas turbine technology and grid components makes it a direct beneficiary of the energy transition and the burgeoning demand for AI-driven electricity. The company also enjoys significant tailwinds from tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Beyond GE Vernova, a broad spectrum of industrial companies are poised for continued success. Manufacturers of heavy construction equipment like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) are benefiting from infrastructure projects, while engineering and construction firms such as Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE: J) are securing lucrative contracts for new facilities and infrastructure upgrades. Companies involved in renewable energy components and smart grid technologies, like Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE: ETN) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE), are seeing increased demand. Furthermore, firms providing industrial automation and robotics solutions to optimize manufacturing processes are also experiencing robust growth.

Conversely, companies that are slow to adapt to these evolving market dynamics may find themselves at a disadvantage. Industrial firms heavily reliant on outdated manufacturing processes, lacking investment in sustainable technologies, or with significant exposure to volatile international supply chains without a clear reshoring strategy, could face headwinds. Those unable to innovate or integrate advanced automation and AI into their operations risk falling behind more agile competitors. The shift towards domestic production also means that companies with limited U.S. manufacturing capabilities might need to re-evaluate their operational footprint to capitalize on government incentives and meet evolving customer demands.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Economic Fabric

The robust performance of the Industrials sector signifies more than just short-term market gains; it reflects a fundamental reshaping of the economic fabric. This surge fits squarely into broader industry trends emphasizing sustainability, technological advancement, and national security. The aggressive pursuit of clean energy targets and the rapid deployment of AI infrastructure are not fleeting fads but long-term strategic imperatives that will continue to drive industrial innovation and investment for decades.

The ripple effects of this industrial momentum are extensive. Competitors are compelled to accelerate their own investments in automation, reshoring, and green technologies to remain competitive. Partnerships are forming between industrial giants and technology providers to integrate cutting-edge solutions. From a regulatory standpoint, the continued success of these initiatives reinforces the efficacy of policies like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, potentially paving the way for further government support and incentives in these critical areas. Historically, periods of significant infrastructure investment and technological shifts have often led to prolonged periods of economic growth and industrial transformation, suggesting a similar trajectory for the current cycle.

Moreover, the emphasis on domestic manufacturing has profound implications for national security and economic independence. By reducing reliance on foreign supply chains, the U.S. enhances its ability to withstand global disruptions and maintain critical production capabilities. This strategic imperative is likely to sustain political and financial backing for the Industrials sector, embedding its growth drivers deeply into national policy.

What Comes Next: Charting the Future of Industrials

Looking ahead, the short-term outlook for the Industrials sector appears bright, supported by ongoing government spending, resilient economic activity, and strong corporate earnings projections. The momentum from reshoring, infrastructure, and the energy transition is expected to continue driving demand for industrial products and services. Companies like GE Vernova are well-positioned for sustained growth as the global economy continues its shift towards electrification and AI-driven power demands.

In the long term, the sustainability of these trends will depend on continued policy support, technological innovation, and the ability of industrial firms to adapt to evolving market conditions. Potential strategic pivots will include deeper integration of AI and machine learning into manufacturing processes, further investment in sustainable and circular economy practices, and the development of new solutions for grid modernization and renewable energy storage. Market opportunities will likely emerge in specialized niches within automation, advanced materials, and smart infrastructure. Challenges could arise from potential supply chain bottlenecks for critical components, skilled labor shortages, and unexpected shifts in geopolitical landscapes or regulatory environments.

Investors should anticipate a landscape characterized by continued innovation and strategic consolidation. The sector may see further spin-offs or mergers as companies streamline operations to focus on core growth areas. The ongoing electrification of transportation and industrial processes will also present significant opportunities. Scenarios range from sustained robust growth, particularly for companies aligned with green energy and digital transformation, to periods of consolidation as the market matures and efficiency becomes paramount.

Wrap-Up: A Resilient Sector Poised for Lasting Impact

In summary, the S&P 500 Industrials sector's significant positive performance today, spearheaded by market leader GE Vernova, highlights a powerful convergence of economic and policy catalysts. The relentless drive towards reshoring, massive infrastructure investments, and the global energy transition—supercharged by the demands of AI—are fundamentally reshaping the industrial landscape. These factors are not merely transient market fluctuations but represent deep-seated structural shifts that promise sustained growth for the sector.

Moving forward, the Industrials sector is poised for continued resilience and growth, making it a compelling area for investors seeking exposure to long-term economic transformation. The market's assessment points to a sector that is not only adapting but actively leading the charge in critical areas of national importance and technological advancement.

The investment plan revealed Monday will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing in critical minerals, pharmaceutical precursors and robotics; defense and aerospace; energy independence, with investments in battery storage and grid resilience; and strategic technologies, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and quantum computing.

The investment is part of the bank’s Security and Resiliency Initiative, a $1.5 trillion, 10-year plan to facilitate, finance and invest in industries critical to national security.

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy. America needs more speed and investment.”

This summer, JPMorgan helped put together a deal under which the Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in U.S. rare earth company MP Materials. The bank is also providing financing for MP Materials’ second magnet producing factory in the U.S.

The nation’s largest bank plans to finance approximately $1 trillion over the next decade in support of clients in these industries. JPMorgan Chase is looking to increase this amount by up to $500 billion, or a 50% increase, with additional resources and capital.

“America needs more speed and investment,” Dimon said. “It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need.”

JPMorgan says that it serves 34,000 mid-sized companies and more than 90% of the Fortune 500.

Mr Farley, speaking last week at the Ford Pro Accelerate summit in Detroit, said he saw a huge impact from the policy change.

As reported by Fortune magazine, Mr Farley said he believed manufacturing EVs was a “vibrant industry” but in the future, is “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.”

He said that the end of the $US7500 ($A11,430) consumer incentive was “a game-changer” and said he wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5 per cent of the industry from the current level of 10-12 per cent.

The fear is backed by a joint study in November 2024 by professors from three universities – University of California Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University – that said EV registrations could fall 27 per cent without a tax credit.

Reuters reported that many automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in US EV sales because of the effects of the US inflation reduction act (IRA).

Aside from Ford, Nissan Americas chairman Christian Meunier said the EV market would “collapse” in October.

However, Volvo and Hyundai are at least two who aren’t too pessimistic about the EV subsidy withdrawal.

Volvo Car CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters it would not change its strategy based on government policies.

“Our ambition is to be an electric company,” he said.

“That is not based on any tax credits or incentives. It’s based on an electric car being better

for US consumers.”

Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker said the company is offering a discount on its 2025 model Ioniq 5 EV of $US7500 – equivalent to the now discontinued government credit – and up to $US9800 ($A14,930) off the Ioniq 5’s 2026 model.

He said: “There was an EV market before IRA, and there’s going to be an EV market after IRA.”

In the fallout, some dealers said they were concerned that the removal of the tax credit would leave them with unsold EVs.

Nissan Americas’ chairman Meunier said competition “is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock.”

“Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” he told Reuters. Nissan is now launching its new Leaf EV in the US.

But the biggest losers will be the pure EV manufacturers, including Tesla and Rivian, and battery makers.

Rivian reported an increase in sales of almost 32 per cent in the third quarter. It has reduced its forecast for the full year because of the end of the tax credit which hit the share price, pushing its share price down by more than 7 per cent.

Tesla used incentives to maximise sales before the tax credit ended and posted record sales for the third quarter.

US financial analyst firm Visible Alpha now estimates Tesla’s full-year 2025 sales will be about 10 per cent below 2024 which, in turn, was 8 per cent below 2023.

Fortune magazine said that battery makers face a growing US surplus. It said plans to build more battery factories have been shelved and that this would undermine a cornerstone of President Trump’s tariff regime designed to rebuild factories in the US.

Ford’s Jim Farley said that “customers are not interested in a $US75,000 ($A114,000) electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”But he said that customers were more interested in partial electrification.

“We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kinds of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with,” he said, and implied that those customers were also falling out of love with pure-EVs.

The history of the tax credit for EVs started in the US in 2008. In that year, the US congress approved a $US7500 tax credit for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the US that use certain levels of domestically-sourced batteries and materials.

US president Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration.

His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations.

Mr Trump campaigned last year on ending former president Joe Biden’s “EV mandate.”",https://premium.goauto.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Farley_25_Int-Feature-1600x470-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 02:57:48.083946

The agreement was formalized by Javier Imaz, Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO) of Gestamp, and Gilles Mirol, Chief Marketing Officer of Hydnum Steel.

Under the terms of the partnership, Gestamp —through its metal recycling subsidiary, Gescrap— will supply high-quality steel scrap from stamping processes to Hydnum Steel, which will then use renewable energy and green hydrogen to produce ultra-low CO₂ emission steel.

The agreement also includes technical collaboration to develop steel grades that meet the automotive industry’s demanding standards in terms of chemical composition, mechanical properties, thickness, and finish. Gestamp will have priority access to these low-emission steels for the production of advanced metal components, further supporting the transition to sustainable mobility.

This collaboration will help advance circularity, a key pillar for decarbonizing the automotive supply chain and for achieving, in the long term, the Net Zero Car.

The initiative aligns with Gestamp’s decarbonisation strategy, which emphasizes the use of more sustainable raw materials, material recycling, and partnerships with strategic allies to drive cleaner and more efficient mobility. Recycling production scrap—especially steel and aluminium, which account for more than 70% of Gestamp’s total emissions due to their carbon-intensive production processes—is particularly critical.

Gestamp’s circularity model ensures the availability of high-quality scrap to produce ultra-low-emission steels, enabling full traceability of the material lifecycle through collection, sorting, and reintegration into the production chain.

For Hydnum Steel, the extensive use of scrap metal as a raw material is central to applying circular economy principles to its production model. Its Puertollano plant will be the first of its kind in the Iberian Peninsula, operating with an electric arc furnace powered exclusively by renewable energy. The substitution of natural gas with green hydrogen will reduce emissions by 98% compared to a traditional steel mill. The plant will also feature a closed-loop water treatment and reuse system, achieving zero discharge.

Javier Imaz, Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO) of Gestamp, said: “This agreement marks another step forward in our efforts to decarbonize the automotive industry and strengthens our circular economy model, which is based on the sustainable management of resources and the reuse of our high-quality scrap in steel production”.

Are you thinking about buying an electric vehicle?","While the electric vehicle tax credit expired Sept. 30, residents in Burlington, Vermont, can still snag up to $5,700 in EV rebates through the Burlington Electric Department.

As WPTZ reported, the EV incentive program launched Oct. 1 and will run through 2026, offering residents a refund of $5,000 or $5,700 for income-eligible buyers. City leaders announced the program in late September, noting that the incentive offers have doubled compared to a former EV rebate program, which provided rebates of $2,300 or $3,000, depending on income.

Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak told NBC5 that, despite the federal EV tax credits ending seven years earlier than anticipated, the city is doing its best to promote a healthy, eco-friendly environment and help residents make sustainable choices.

""Reversing the harmful effects of climate change and making our community climate-resilient will require both bold policy solutions and collective action on the part of residents,"" she said.

Tax breaks and rebates can make it easier to switch to an EV, but even without the incentives, EV owners can still save a fortune on gas, maintenance, and other expenses compared to gas-powered vehicles.

According to the Department of Energy, drivers can expect to save up to $2,200 per year on fuel costs for a fully electric vehicle and around $1,500 for a plug-in hybrid.

If you charge your EV at home with solar panels, you could save an additional 60% each year, according to EnergySage, and spend less time waiting at charging stations. The company estimates that the average EV owner may spend around $300 charging their car at home with solar energy, compared to up to $700 using grid electricity, and a staggering $2,500 for a gas-fueled vehicle.

With electricity and car repair bills skyrocketing, it's never been a better time to level up to an EV.

Not to mention, electric vehicles are significantly better for the planet compared to polluting gas cars, which contribute to rising temperatures and more extreme weather. A study by the Argonne National Laboratory, a DOE-funded science and engineering research lab, found that EV drivers reduce carbon pollution by 1 pound per mile, which equates to roughly 75% less pollution generated compared to a conventional gas car.

The more drivers that adopt EVs, the easier it will be on their wallets and the environment. Even though the tax credits have expired, 13 states are still offering tax breaks and rebates for purchasing an EV, according to personal finance experts at Money. Additionally, the federal tax credit for EV charging equipment remains available until mid-2026, covering up to $1,000 for residential installations and up to $100,000 for businesses, as per the Internal Revenue Service.

No other solar project in the U.S. comes close to that scale.
The bureau completed a draft environmental review of the megaproject under the Biden administration, but didn’t release a final version.
President Donald Trump swept into office declaring an ​“energy emergency” and pledging to unleash more American energy and bring down prices.
Currently, only 4% of terrestrial, utility-scale renewable capacity sits on federal land, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.","An enormous solar project planned for the Nevada desert was canceled last week while awaiting final federal approvals, an ominous sign for renewables development on public lands under the Trump administration.

Esmeralda 7 was unique for its size: It would have installed 6.2 gigawatts of solar generation and 5.2 gigawatts of battery capacity across 62,300 acres of Nevada desert. No other solar project in the U.S. comes close to that scale. It was also a test case for a new, more efficient approach to federal permitting, one that promised to get clean energy infrastructure built more quickly.

The solar colossus incorporated seven distinct solar-and-battery projects from different developers on adjacent parcels of land overseen by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Instead of each going through an exhaustive process to attain federal permits, the projects banded together to undergo a joint analysis by the BLM. The bureau completed a draft environmental review of the megaproject under the Biden administration, but didn’t release a final version. Instead, as first reported by Heatmap, the BLM website switched the project status to ​“cancelled” on Thursday.

It’s not yet clear if the decision to cancel was made by the BLM or Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, or if the Esmeralda 7 developers pulled out, perhaps based on conversations with the government. An automated email reply from Scott Distel, the BLM contact for the project, said he is not authorized to work during the government shutdown and thus was unable to respond.

The BLM circulated a statement to media on Friday saying that ​“applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.” Such a move would entail repeating the already-conducted environmental analysis for each project individually, after which the administration could simply move to cancel the projects again.

“While we await further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process, we remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association, wrote in a statement Friday.

President Donald Trump swept into office declaring an ​“energy emergency” and pledging to unleash more American energy and bring down prices. Since then, though, his administration has intervened to obstruct several major power projects that would deliver renewable electricity to the grid at a time of swiftly rising power demand.

The White House attempted to halt two fully permitted offshore wind farms, the 810-megawatt Empire Wind 1 and the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind. Offshore wind requires permissions from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, giving the administration leverage over this type of private enterprise. Those efforts to stop construction did not hold up, but they incurred millions of dollars of unanticipated costs for the developers, and damaged the country’s reputation as a safe place to invest in billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

Currently, only 4% of terrestrial, utility-scale renewable capacity sits on federal land, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. But in the U.S. West, many federal parcels are well-suited for renewable energy; if these sites were successfully developed, they could greatly increase clean energy production.

Esmeralda 7 appears to be the first large renewable development on public lands to be officially cancelled during the Trump administration, said Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Previously, he added, some projects that were expected to move forward were ​“sitting in limbo,” neither cancelled nor approved on schedule. Now, Kelly said, there’s ​“a real concern” that public lands may be effectively off limits for wind or solar development for the duration of the Trump administration.

While it lasted, Esmeralda 7 modeled a new, more streamlined way to analyze a huge amount of renewable capacity.

“It increases efficiency on the government side, not having to recreate the same review of the same type of impact over and over again,” Kelly noted. Combining the permitting also helps in scrutinizing the cumulative effect of multiple projects, something environmental advocates have pushed for.

The BLM released its draft environmental impact statement in late July 2024, kicking off a 90-day comment period, which included an in-person public meeting and an online one.

The project would have impacted the desert landscape. But the draft environmental review identified those impacts and outlined mitigation efforts needed to protect endangered species and minimize disruption to desert plants. Esmeralda 7 also would have had environmental benefits by displacing polluting power production with emissions-free generation.

Projects that undergo thorough vetting and abide by the government’s conditions have a legal right to move forward, Kelly said. Under U.S. law, the government can’t cancel a project without mustering a set of reasons and evidence; the Administrative Procedures Act forbids ​“arbitrary and capricious” decisions that violate due process.

“It’s inconsistent with the law, but it’s also obviously inconsistent with what our country needs,” Kelly said of the cancellation.

Several prominent voices outside the clean energy industry expressed alarm at the news. Utah’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox blasted the cancellation on X, writing, ​“This is how we lose the AI/​energy arms race with China. … Solar with batteries can now be close to baseload power and we should keep these projects rolling until we get the gas/​nuclear/​geothermal plants we need.”

Billionaire John Arnold, who made a name for himself as a gas trader at Enron, also tweeted about the cancellation, saying, ​“I’m increasingly worried we’re headed for the cliff.” Coal, hydropower, and nuclear are not projected to grow much in this decade, he noted, so ​“all growth has to come from gas, solar & wind.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1395198787-copy.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=72c3ce295ff9e1d8de823ca099bba1b5,N,,2025-10-13 21:59:15.923299

With the federal solar tax credit expiring on December 31, 2025, Virginians face a critical window to capitalize on the 30% cost reduction for solar installations.
Virginia’s solar market remains robust, but the 2025 cutoff marks a pivotal moment.","Alexandria, VA – Virginia’s solar energy landscape has been boosted by the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, often referred to as the solar tax credit, which offers homeowners a 30% reimbursement on the cost of installing solar panels, batteries, and related equipment. This incentive, extended under the Inflation Reduction Act, has made solar more affordable, reducing installation costs by thousands for the average household. In Virginia, where sunny conditions and rising energy bills make solar appealing, the credit has spurred widespread adoption, with over 10,000 residential systems installed in recent years.

However, federal legislation signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025, accelerates the credit’s end date to December 31, 2025—nearly a decade earlier than originally planned. Previously set to continue through 2032 at a stepped-down rate, the credit will now vanish entirely after 2025, eliminating the 30% deduction for systems placed in service starting January 1, 2026. This change stems from budget reconciliation efforts prioritizing fiscal restraint, though it has drawn criticism from environmental groups for hindering clean energy progress.

For Virginians, the implications are stark. A typical 7kW solar system costing $20,000 could save $6,000 via the credit—savings that disappear post-2025. Local incentives, like Charlottesville’s property tax credit (up to 0.98% annually for five years on system value), persist but pale in comparison. Net metering, which credits excess energy to utility bills, remains intact statewide, but without the federal boost, payback periods could extend from 6 to 8 years to over a decade.

Homeowners should act swiftly: Secure quotes now and aim to complete installations by year-end to qualify. As of September 2025, demand is surging, with installers reporting backlogs. This deadline underscores the urgency of transitioning to renewables amid Virginia’s ambitious clean energy goals, potentially slowing momentum toward a sustainable future. With the federal solar tax credit expiring on December 31, 2025, Virginians face a critical window to capitalize on the 30% cost reduction for solar installations. Delaying could mean missing out on thousands in savings, as local incentives like Charlottesville’s modest property tax credit or net metering can’t match the federal benefit’s impact. Homeowners should prioritize securing contracts and scheduling installations now, as installers face growing backlogs amid heightened demand.

The abrupt end to the credit, driven by fiscal policy shifts, has sparked debate. Supporters argue it aligns with budget priorities, while critics warn it undermines Virginia’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. Without the credit, solar adoption may slow, extending reliance on fossil fuels and increasing household energy costs over time. For a 7kW system, the loss of a $6,000 credit could stretch payback periods significantly, making solar less accessible for middle-income families.

To maximize savings, homeowners should consult certified installers, verify eligibility for remaining local incentives, and ensure systems are operational by the deadline. Community solar programs, which don’t rely on individual installations, may offer an alternative for renters or those unable to install panels. Virginia’s solar market remains robust, but the 2025 cutoff marks a pivotal moment. Acting now ensures financial benefits and supports the state’s clean energy vision, preserving momentum toward a greener, more resilient energy future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-ceoblognation-com/2025/10/29671db0-facebook-ad-2025-10-13t205025.601.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 21:59:37.121624

You might imagine nuclear power plants as behemoth facilities spanning hundreds of acres. Nuclear microreactors, by contrast, could sit on land the size of a football field and power a whole town.

However, after decades of fraught relationships between the nuclear industry and communities in many parts of the U.S., building these tiny reactors requires reckoning with the complex history of nuclear technology and rebuilding public trust.

Microreactor technology for use in towns or cities hasn’t been developed yet, but many researchers have been building the case for its use.

For example, this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.

I’m a nuclear engineer who has been exploring nuclear microreactors’ potential. My research and teaching focuses on some of the questions that would come with placing miniature nuclear reactors close to where people live.

Nuclear microreactors as a technology are both new and old. In the 1940s and ’50s, the American military and government began developing small reactors and nuclear batteries to power submarines and spacecraft.

After developing these small-scale reactors and batteries for various missions, the nuclear industry’s focus shifted to power reactors. They began to rapidly scale up their designs from producing tens of megawatts to the gigawatt-scale systems common around the world today.

These historical reactors were small because scientists were still learning about the physics and engineering underlying these systems. Today, engineers are deliberately designing microreactors to be small.

Microreactors aren’t to be confused with small modular reactors — these are often scaled-down, modularized versions of large reactors. Small, modular reactors can be built as single units or in clusters to achieve the same capacity as a full-size reactor. Microreactors would be smaller than these, with a power capacity under 20 megawatts.

Manufacturing and cost

Because they’re small, microreactors wouldn’t require a massive, multiyear construction project like large nuclear power reactors. Several units could be assembled in a factory each year and shipped off to their final destinations in a truck or on a barge.

Large reactors are not inherently flawed — in many ways, they remain the more economic nuclear energy option. However, electric utility companies have recently hesitated to invest in large reactors because of the multibillion-dollar nature of these projects.

Microreactors require a different but equally significant kind of investment. Though individual units will have a significantly lower price tag, building a factory to produce these microreactors is a massive undertaking. Reactor companies are waiting for their order books to fill up before investing in factories.

It’s a catch-22. Without orders, technology developers are unlikely to build microreactor factories. And future users of these new reactors are unlikely to place orders until this new style of production has been tested and the initial units built.

Future users are also waiting to see what the microreactors will actually cost. Reactor developers have put forward many cost estimates, but in the past, estimates for nuclear reactors haven’t always been reliable. Developers likely won’t know the true numbers until the reactors are actually built.

Initial “first of a kind” units will undoubtedly cost significantly more than later units. As manufacturers learn the best production processes, they’ll be able to make more reactors for less.

In this paradoxical situation in which developers are waiting for orders and users are waiting to see the economics of initial reactors, government funding for building demonstration projects could help usher microreactor technology from early designs to the market.

First movers such as national laboratories, universities, data centers and military bases that are willing to buy these initial reactors also have a role to play in validating the economic feasibility of these new reactors.

Today’s microreactors

In a nuclear reactor, the combination of nuclear fuel and coolant — which is the substance used to both cool the fuel and transport the heat generated by it — used in its design determines what situations it will work best in. Many nonwater coolants can allow reactors to operate at lower pressures, which is a little more safe.

The microreactors being developed today are based on a wide range of reactor technologies and make use of many different combinations of nuclear fuels and coolants.

Some reactors, such as the submarine propulsion reactors, are small, pressurized water reactors — the same basic technology used in most large-scale nuclear power plants. Others use configurations that resemble the small reactors in spacecraft. Still others make use of nuclear fuel and coolant combinations previously attempted in much larger reactors, such as high-temperature gas reactors, sodium fast reactors and even molten salt reactors.

Though encompassing a range of technologies, microreactors are all significantly simpler than the large reactors in use today. In many cases, they have few to no moving parts.

Microreactors, by virtue of being significantly simpler, are going to be more knowable. Because they’re easier to study and understand, simpler reactor systems have fewer points of failure and safety concerns.

Complex systems, such as the large nuclear power reactors, can be fundamentally unknowable, with unexpected entanglements of “unknown unknowns” creating instabilities, safety concerns and potential for failure. Large reactors operate safely today because we have learned about these unknown unknowns over decades of operation. Microreactors, because of their simplicity, will fundamentally be safer and more predictable than the large reactors were when they were first built.

Siting microreactors

Although the Department of Energy oversees microreactor demonstration projects, commercial deployment of microreactors requires approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could take several years and may ultimately determine how soon commercial reactors can be built. Several designs are now approaching or in the early stages of review.

To keep people safe, large reactors have designated emergency planning zones — usually 10 and 50 miles around — which require different degrees of planning and protection to enter. The 10-mile zone has specific shelters and evacuation plans in place, while people in the 50-mile zone may need to take precautions about what they eat and drink in the event of a catastrophic accident but will not need to evacuate.

Because microreactors are smaller and simpler, developers and regulators may significantly reduce their emergency planning zones. The zones could extend only to the facility’s site boundary, or perhaps a few hundred meters beyond it.

A reduced emergency planning zone could mean that microreactors could be built in towns and cities, or embedded in remote communities. They might one day become as ubiquitous as the solar panels and windmills you see when driving through the countryside. And like the submarine reactors that can power a small underwater community of 100, one microreactor could power a rural town.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?

Public engagement

My lab’s ongoing research suggests that the answer to this question is contingent on how technology developers engage with the communities that may host a microreactor. If they attempt to unilaterally decide, announce and defend their decision to build a microreactor without input, communities will likely push back.

However, if developers work with communities to understand their hopes, concerns and priorities, they will likely find that many people are receptive to hyperlocal nuclear energy facilities.

My team’s initial findings suggest that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach for designing these facilities. Each community will have its own set of preferences that developers will need to navigate alongside the engineering questions.

In our discussions with community members in southeast Michigan, my research team has seen interest in designing these small energy facilities as a feature of the community that’s easily accessible to local residents. Community members designing hypothetical microreactor facilities with us have proposed shared spaces, recreational facilities, onsite visitor centers or science museums, and public art projects. Instead of hiding these facilities out of sight, they want these places to be inviting and beautiful.

“Manufacturers won’t bother making outdated, short-range hybrids just for smaller markets,” one industry analyst noted.
Instead, automakers are doubling down on extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) — hybrids that run primarily on electric power but include a small gasoline engine as backup.
New fuel economy standards will also make combustion engines inside plug-in hybrids more efficient.
By enforcing a higher minimum standard, China is effectively raising the global bar for plug-in hybrids and redefining what qualifies as a “modern” hybrid.","Starting January 1, 2026, all plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) exported from China will be required to deliver at least 100 kilometers of battery-only range — a bold move that is set to shake up automakers worldwide.

The new regulation, part of China’s evolving New Energy Vehicle (NEV) strategy, signals a decisive shift from quantity to quality in automotive exports.

It reflects Beijing’s response to mounting trade barriers, such as the European Union’s tariffs on Chinese battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), while underscoring a push for higher technological standards across its auto industry.

China’s NEV exports — especially plug-in hybrids — have been surging. Exports jumped 190% year-on-year in 2024, and by May 2025, they were up another 127%, with shipments to the EU skyrocketing nearly 600% thanks to tariff advantages.

In 2024 alone, China exported 6.41 million vehicles, generating about $117.4 billion in revenue — but export volumes in 2025 are expected to ease slightly to around 5.8 to 6.2 million units as the country prioritizes higher-end models.

The new 100km rule means that short-range plug-in hybrids — often capable of only 50km or less on battery power — are effectively obsolete.

For consumers, this means that many PHEVs sold today could lose value quickly. “Manufacturers won’t bother making outdated, short-range hybrids just for smaller markets,” one industry analyst noted.

Instead, automakers are doubling down on extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) — hybrids that run primarily on electric power but include a small gasoline engine as backup.

Brands like Zeekr and Xpeng are already producing PHEVs and EREVs boasting 300 to 400+ km of electric range and charging speeds jumping from 50kW to as high as 500kW.

In major cities, only EVs, PHEVs, and EREVs qualify for new car registrations or number plates. That makes the new 100km rule a natural filter: only long-range hybrids will be considered future-proof.

New fuel economy standards will also make combustion engines inside plug-in hybrids more efficient. The result: owners will drive in full-electric mode for most trips, making these new hybrids behave almost like pure EVs — without the range anxiety.

Industry experts see the law as a “game-changer”. By enforcing a higher minimum standard, China is effectively raising the global bar for plug-in hybrids and redefining what qualifies as a “modern” hybrid.

Short-range models will likely be sold off as old stock, but producing them in the long term will no longer make economic sense. As one insider put it, “This policy marks the end of the low-range plug-in era.”

Within months of implementation, market analysts expect a massive shift toward long-range hybrids, creating new benchmarks for performance, efficiency, and export competitiveness.

China’s 100km rule isn’t just a technical regulation — it’s a strategic pivot. It will force global automakers to upgrade, innovate, or be left behind.

By 2026, the age of short-range plug-in hybrids will be over — and the world’s next wave of electrified vehicles will almost certainly have “Made in China” stamped on them.",https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews%2F2024-11-18%2Fv3tmci8a%2FStock___BYD_Atto_3_188e1cbf42a_original_ratio.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-13 22:58:49.234236

As much as 90 percent of all battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles sold in the United States through the first nine months of the year are believed to have benefited from some form of tax credit, according to market research firm Rho Motion.

A Surge Before the Deadline

The end of the federal EV tax credit on October 1 set off a nationwide rush for qualifying models, driving record sales for several brands and pushing overall EV demand to new highs in August and September.

This year, the EPA determined that 20 battery-electric vehicles and a single plug-in hybrid model were eligible for the New Clean Vehicle Credit, valued at up to $7,500. These vehicles together accounted for 55 percent of all EV sales from January through September.

Leasing Loopholes and Fleet Boosts

Of equal importance in propping up sales was the lesser-known Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, also valued at up to $7,500.

This credit was available for vehicles weighing less than 14,000 lbs and aimed at fleet and business buyers. This is also the credit that allowed car manufacturers to claim the tax credit themselves, and then to reduce the lease price on new vehicles.

Notably, leased passenger cars and trucks were not subject to the same sourcing and assembly requirements as purchased vehicles. They also didn’t need to be built in North America, which made leasing an especially attractive option for both manufacturers and buyers.

As the September 30 axing date for the credits drew closer, sales of electrified vehicles surged across the United States. As noted by Rho Motion, Ford sold 30,612 battery-electric vehicles in the third quarter, a huge 86 percent increase from Q2.

Additionally, GM’s BEV sales jumped 44 percent to 66,501 units. Tesla also reported a 27 percent sales increase, and Hyundai also enjoyed substantial growth, thanks to a more than doubling of demand for the Ioniq 5.

What Comes After the Incentives?

It remains to be seen how sharply BEV and PHEV sales will dip in the fourth quarter now that the tax credit has ended. Rho Motion expects demand to “decline sharply.”

The research firm also points out that tariffs, high local manufacturing costs, and relaxed fuel efficiency standards are likely to deter investment in domestic EV production, creating further pressure on demand in the months ahead.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kia-2026_EV4-copy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 21:00:08.471030

By Eric Starkman

Here’s an undeniable truth about GM CEO Mary Barra and her “north star” zero-emissions, green-energy ambitions: they were all predicated on the charity of U.S. taxpayers.

Barra’s EV crusade was powered not by visionary risk, but by feeding from the public trough—generous taxpayer rebates even for EVs built in Mexico; taxpayers asked to fund the charging infrastructure necessary for mass adoption; taxpayers expected to bankroll the retooling of U.S. factories for EV production.

Barra apparently assumed President Biden—to whom she reportedly was close and whose chief legislative aide was a former GM lobbyist—would win reelection. When Americans instead sent Donald Trump back to the White House, Barra’s taxpayer gravy train was abruptly derailed.

Trump quickly moved to eliminate taxpayer EV subsidies. We’ll soon learn how well GM’s electric lineup performs without government welfare. But before that reckoning, Barra already has axed another promised “clean energy” initiative at the mere hint that taxpayer handouts might stop.

Barra’s Hydrogen Hot Air

GM last week scrapped plans for a Detroit factory and killed its hydrogen-fuel-cell program for everyday drivers. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water vapor as exhaust. GM once touted the technology as a clean-energy bridge between gasoline and battery power—one that could have given Detroit a legitimate green edge.

Not coincidentally, the decision came days after the Trump administration floated canceling two federal grants totaling $52 million that the Biden administration had awarded GM for hydrogen development in Pontiac. GM had already mooched $9 million of that money.

Salaried workers in Pontiac tied to GM’s Hydrotec division were summarily dismissed. GM spokesman Stu Fowle declined to say how many. The Detroit factory would have employed 144 people and cost $55 million, in partnership with a subsidiary of Piston Automotive (owned by former Detroit Pistons star Vinnie Johnson). That project is now dead.

“Every company has to look at and prioritize where we apply our resources,” Fowle told the Detroit News.

Translation: with the mere threat of the subsidies disappearing, GM’s hydrogen ambitions immediately vanished with them.

Billions for Buybacks

Meanwhile, GM has spent $25 billion in the past three years buying back its stock—legal market manipulation that artificially inflated GM’s underperforming share price under Barra’s leadership. Barra has personally profited handsomely: she sold a trove of shares in 2024 and pocketed $82 million, more than the entire cost of the hydrogen venture she just killed. She recently unloaded another 40 percent of her GM holdings.

Barra’s retreat from hydrogen stands in stark contrast to Toyota and BMW, which continue investing in fuel-cell technology. Even Ford maintains hydrogen research for its heavy-duty vehicles.

Unlike Barra, the CEOs of Toyota and BMW didn’t rush blindly into EVs before consumers or infrastructure were ready. They’re building long-term capabilities; Barra chased short-term taxpayer subsidy checks.

Shamefully, Barra’s annual compensation—roughly $29 million—is about five times that of Toyota’s CEO, who runs a larger, more profitable global company.

Gov. Whitmer’s Disgrace

GM years ago was awarded $3.5 billion in Michigan grants and subsidies on the condition that it keep 4,000 jobs at Detroit’s Renaissance Center headquarters. Governor Gretchen Whitmer quietly relieved Barra of that requirement in exchange for GM’s commitment to “Factory Zero,” its heavily subsidized EV plant in Detroit.

The future of Factory Zero, where GM builds its GMC EV Hummer and Cadillac Escalade IQ, already looks shaky. About 280 employees there remain on layoff through year-end according to the Detroit Free Press. A popular YouTuber recently reported attending an auction featuring 20 brand-new, never-driven EV Hummers—vehicles that can easily retail north of six figures. When your “green halo” product goes straight from factory to auction block, that’s cause for alarm.

Adding insult to injury, a climate group has deemed the Hummer more environmentally harmful than most gas-engine vehicles. Tellingly, Barra reportedly tools around town in a black EV Hummer. Nothing says “sustainability” like a 9,000-plus-pound electric monster—a vehicle multiple reviewers said had inadequate brakes for its brawn.

GM’s Headquarters?

GM refuses to disclose how many employees it will house in its supposed new headquarters inside Dan Gilbert’s heavily subsidized Hudson’s Detroit tower. The automaker is leasing just four floors—it’s a safe bet the edifice won’t even house half the 4,000 employees GM was once required to employ in Detroit.

“While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Sales surge ahead of rebate deadline

Experts attribute the strong sales numbers to the phaseout of federal EV tax credits.

The Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Act ended federal EV incentives last month, cutting off rebates of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used zero-emission vehicles purchased after September 30, 2025.

“Sales are notably higher than they would have been, although it is difficult to say exactly how much higher,” wrote David Bunch, professor emeritus of Graduate School of Management at the University of California, in an email.

“Although the 29% figure is nice to see, this does not change the fact that EV sales have flattened out after very large growth a few years ago,” he added.

Alan Jenn, an assistant professor at the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis agreed the strong sales numbers are likely connected to the sunsetting of federal tax credits, as many consumers rushed to take advantage of the rebates before they disappear. At the same time, he doesn’t expect demand to “collapse” moving forward.

“While we know that incentives helped to increase sales, they were not responsible for all of the sales that happened in the past ... studies typically show 20%-50% increase in sales thanks to incentives, so the remaining would likely still happen.”

California’s fight to defend its clean-car authority

California is currently in a legal battle to overturn the Congressional Review Act resolutions signed by President Trump that aim to revoke federal waivers permitting the state to set its own vehicle emissions standards toward 100% zero-emission new car sales by 2035.

In June, the Trump administration signed three CRA resolutions overturning several of California’s major climate programs, including its Advanced Clean Cars II rules, the latest evolution of the state’s zero-emission vehicle rules. They remain unenforceable amid ongoing litigation, leaving California with only regulatory guidance and no binding mandates in effect for now.

“We are determined to defend our authority in court so we can reduce these harmful air emissions and continue to move the market forward,” Lindsay Buckley, a spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said Monday.

In response to Trump’s move, California’s top officials sued the federal government, asserting that the action violates federal law and undermines decades of climate progress, endangering California’s economy and the health of its residents.

“In the 50 years since the Clean Air Act was enacted, waivers have never been subject to the CRA,” Attorney General Rob Bonta’s news release stated in June.

“If California is prevented from enforcing these vehicle emission standards, it will result in the loss of significant economic and public health benefits, costing California taxpayers an estimated $45 billion in preventable health care costs.”

When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.”

— Michael Avanesian

LOS ANGELES, CA, UNITED STATES, October 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Federal safety regulators launched an investigation into Tesla's electronic door systems following a November 2024 crash that claimed three college students' lives after they became trapped inside a Cybertruck in Piedmont, California. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) probe encompasses 174,000 Tesla Model Y vehicles amid mounting evidence of electronic door system failures.

California Personal Injury attorney Michael Avanesian of Avian Law Group states that Tesla's electronic door systems present safety concerns that prioritize technological innovation over emergency egress principles. Recent wrongful death lawsuits filed by families of 19-year-old Krysta Tsukahara (Tsukahara v. Dixon, Alameda County Superior Court) and 20-year-old Jack Nelson (Nelson v. Tesla Inc., Case No. 25CV120058, Alameda County Superior Court) allege Tesla's door design prevented their escape from the burning vehicle.

""This case demonstrates the intersection of advanced technology and fundamental safety requirements,"" said Avanesian. ""When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.""

Federal Investigation Reveals Pattern of System Failures

NHTSA data documents more than 140 consumer complaints regarding Tesla door malfunctions across various models since 2018. The September 2025 investigation (NHTSA Investigation No. PE25-016) targets electronic door handle failures affecting Model Y vehicles, with documented cases of occupants unable to exit vehicles during emergencies.

The Cybertruck operates exclusively through electronic controls that fail when vehicles lose power during crashes. While manual releases exist, they are positioned beneath rubber mats and may be difficult to locate during emergencies, particularly for rear-seat passengers.

Tesla's design chief Franz von Holzhausen acknowledged the need for ""more intuitive door mechanisms during emergency situations"" in September 2025. The company announced plans to redesign door handles, combining electronic and manual releases.

Rising Product Liability in Electric Vehicle Sector

Tesla door defect cases emerge within escalating product liability litigation. Electric vehicle defects present unique litigation challenges. While EVs demonstrate superior fire safety statistics – 0.00044% fire rate compared to 0.1% for internal combustion vehicles – their complex electronic systems create failure modes that can impact occupant egress during emergencies.

""We are observing a shift in automotive liability as manufacturers implement sophisticated electronic systems,"" Avanesian explained. ""The legal system must address emerging risks associated with electronic vehicle technologies that may impact consumer safety.""

Regulatory Framework and International Standards

Current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were established before widespread electronic door system adoption and do not comprehensively address emergency egress requirements. The recently established FMVSS No. 305a focuses primarily on battery safety without comprehensive emergency escape provisions.

China has implemented stricter door handle safety requirements, mandating every door feature external mechanical handles and clearly marked internal releases positioned within 300mm of door edges. European regulators are considering restrictions on fully concealed door handles following safety concerns.

Legal Proceedings and Industry Impact

Avanesian predicts Tesla door defect cases will establish precedents for electric vehicle product liability. ""These lawsuits will determine standards for balancing design innovation with fundamental safety requirements,"" he said. ""The outcome will influence industry practices and consumer protection standards for the electric vehicle sector.""

The wrongful death lawsuits seek unspecified damages and are scheduled for trial in February 2027. Legal experts anticipate additional cases as awareness of door system failures increases among vehicle owners.

As federal investigators examine Tesla's door systems, the electric vehicle industry faces evaluation of safety standards that will determine how innovation integrates with consumer protection requirements.

Implications of the Subpart RR Repeal for the CCUS Industry If finalized, the GHGRP repeal is likely to be particularly disruptive to the CCUS industry.
Current U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) regulations rely on Subpart RR of the GHGRP for these purposes.
This approach could provide a pathway for Treasury to swiftly adjust to the Subpart RR repeal.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently proposed to repeal virtually all of its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), 40 C.F.R. Part 98, which for the last 15 years has required large industrial sources to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions in a national database accessible to state and federal regulators, businesses, and the public. EPA’s proposed rule would end greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for all industries except for certain oil and natural gas facilities. For the oil and natural gas sector, EPA proposes to suspend GHG reporting for natural gas distribution facilities and suspend reporting for all other industry segments until 2034. EPA’s proposal will have significant implications for regulatory programs and stakeholders that rely on the GHGRP for verified GHG emissions data.

EPA established the GHGRP in 2009 in response to a directive from Congress in an appropriations act to establish “mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy of the United States.”1 Since that time, EPA has required GHG emissions reporting from 47 source categories, including oil and gas, power plants, refineries, and chemical manufacturers, as well as fuel suppliers and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection sites. Facilities that emit at least 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent report direct GHG emissions (scope 1 emissions), while fuel suppliers report the CO2 equivalent of their products when combusted by end-users (scope 3 emissions). The 2023 reporting year included around 8,000 facilities and suppliers accounting for roughly 85% to 90% of U.S. GHG emissions.

EPA developed this program pursuant to its information-gathering authority under Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 114, which allows EPA to seek “information necessary” for the development of, or determining compliance with, certain CAA regulatory programs. EPA has relied on the GHGRP to develop certain regulatory regimes, such as the CAA section 111 emissions standards for oil and natural gas facilities and the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons under the AIM Act. EPA now asserts that section 114 requires a closer nexus between continuous reporting and statutory objectives than it previously stated. EPA thus argues that section 114 does not authorize the GHGRP as presently constituted. Alternatively, EPA asserts that the GHGRP is discretionary and, even if the program were lawful, it is no longer needed.

Reliance on the GHGRP extends beyond EPA regulatory schemes. Importantly, as discussed further below, entities seeking to claim a tax credit under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code for carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) projects rely on the GHGRP to quantify the amount of credit for which such projects are eligible.

This Advisory focuses on potential implications of the proposed GHGRP repeal on the CCUS industry, as well as on oil and gas methane reduction efforts.

Implications of the Subpart RR Repeal for the CCUS Industry

If finalized, the GHGRP repeal is likely to be particularly disruptive to the CCUS industry. The primary federal incentive for CCUS projects is the Section 45Q tax credit, which was first enacted in 2008 and expanded under both the Trump administration in 2018 and the Biden administration in 2022. The Section 45Q tax credit can be claimed by taxpayers for capturing carbon oxides that are (1) injected into permanent geologic storage (CCS), (2) injected in an enhanced oil or gas recovery project (EOR/EGR), or (3) utilized in existing commercial markets. GHGRP Subpart RR is the mechanism for the EPA to verify that captured CO2 is geologically stored in a “secure” manner, which is a requirement for claiming the IRS’s 45Q tax credit. Current U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) regulations rely on Subpart RR of the GHGRP for these purposes.

Section 45Q: Near-term Implications of Subpart RR Repeal

In the United States, permanent geologic storage projects must obtain a Class VI injection permit under the EPA Underground Injection Control (UIC) program. Obtaining a Class VI permit triggers reporting requirements under Subpart RR of the GHGRP. These requirements include reporting the quantity of carbon dioxide received, injected, produced, emitted, and sequestered; specific calculation methodologies and quality assurance for each such category of carbon dioxide; and the development of a monitoring, reporting, and verification plan that EPA makes publicly available on its website.

Under current Treasury regulations for the Section 45Q tax credit, Subpart RR is the only method available to demonstrate “secure geological storage” and quantify the amount of carbon dioxide securely stored in a Class VI-permitted CCS project. In the preamble to the regulations, Treasury explained that it “did not provide for an alternative to subpart RR reporting for UIC Class VI wells because all UIC Class VI wells are already subject to subpart RR reporting requirements.” As such, repeal of Subpart RR could leave Class VI projects unable to demonstrate secure geological storage — and therefore unable to claim a Section 45Q tax credit — unless Treasury adopts the Subpart RR as currently codified into a freestanding method or adopts an alternative mechanism.

EOR/EGR projects operating under a Class II permit have more flexibility than Class VI operators. Recognizing that not all Class II operators are required to report under Subpart RR, the Treasury regulations allow such operators to use the international standard CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:20192 (the same ISO used in the Subpart VV regulations that were added to the GHGRP in 2024) as an alternative method. EOR/EGR projects should therefore still have a pathway available to continue claiming a Section 45Q tax credit even if the GHGRP repeal is finalized.

Section 45Q: Longer-Term Alternatives to the GHGRP

Stakeholders are considering a number of potential options to replace the GHGRP’s role in claiming the Section 45Q tax credit. The level of disruption that EPA’s proposal would inflict on the CCUS industry will depend on how swiftly Treasury acts to provide an alternative to GHGRP. To expedite the process, Treasury could issue interim guidance to address the period between the GHGRP repeal and the adoption of updated regulations.

Of course, EPA could choose to carve out Subpart RR from the repeal of the broader GHGRP. EPA could base this, for example, on the significant investment-backed reliance interests of investors in the CCUS industry and the close relationship between carbon capture technology, which is fundamentally designed to control air emissions, and the CAA’s purposes.

Alternatively, EPA could transition certain aspects of Subpart RR into other regulatory programs, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which houses the Class VI permitting program for CO2 underground injection wells. EPA would have to determine that it has legal authority to administer the Subpart RR requirements under the SDWA. Moreover, under either of these alternatives, EPA would have to be interested in maintaining its role in validating and managing emissions data. These EPA approaches would also require coordination between Treasury and EPA on Section 45Q, which may be less efficient than alternatives implemented by Treasury alone.

Treasury also has a number of tools available to fill the gap created by EPA’s repeal. For example, Treasury could, through a variety of mechanisms, incorporate by reference the Subpart RR methodologies in effect prior to repeal. Doing so would essentially freeze the current EPA requirements in place, and could replace the role currently filled by EPA by requiring Section 45Q claimants to obtain approvals from independent third-party auditors evaluating the reporting plans. This approach could provide a pathway for Treasury to swiftly adjust to the Subpart RR repeal.

Another option could be to adopt an international reporting standard, similar to the one that Treasury currently allows for EOR/EGR projects, i.e., ISO 27916, which is inapplicable to most Class VI projects, because this particular standard does not apply to CO2 sequestration purely for purposes of CO2 storage. However, there is a similar standard issued by the same body, ISO 27914, that could apply to most Class VI projects and is currently undergoing a technical revision, expecting to be released in the coming months, to add quantification and verification standards. Once released, ISO 27914 could potentially be adopted by Treasury as an alternative to Subpart RR, perhaps with certain modifications or enhancements provided by Treasury.

Other approaches could involve reliance on state reporting programs. Treasury considered and rejected this approach in 2021, noting that variability between state programs would increase the administrative burden on Treasury. Variability between state programs can also increase complexity and cost of compliance for project proponents. State programs, however, have continued to develop and grow in sophistication since 2021 and could be better harmonized. In addition, stakeholders opposed to EPA’s repeal have cautioned that shifting from a standardized, nationwide annual reporting framework, such as the GHGRP, to an assortment of voluntary or third-party reporting can make it more difficult for investors to assess performance, increasing the perceived risk and thereby increasing the cost of capital for projects.

Implications of EPA’s Proposed Suspension and Partial Repeal of Subpart W Reporting for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry

For the oil and natural gas sector that is required to report GHG emissions under Subpart W of the GHGRP, EPA is proposing to suspend until 2034 the reporting requirements for industry segments subject to the methane waste emissions charge (WEC) under section 136 of the CAA. Accordingly, EPA is eliminating the reporting obligations for the one industry segment not subject to the WEC, natural gas distribution.

Oil and natural gas facilities will still need to report on GHG emissions in states that have adopted their own reporting requirements, several of which incorporate the reporting methodologies established under the GHGRP. However, suspending Subpart W reporting may complicate the ability of operators to demonstrate methane emissions reductions in line with corporate sustainability goals or to meet certain methane intensity requirements in other jurisdictions. For example, EU methane regulations will require importers, including those sourcing from U.S. producers, to provide data on methane intensity and ultimately meet certain emissions standards; Subpart W provided a convenient and consistent option for such reporting. In the absence of Subpart W reporting, operators may have to rely on voluntary GHG accounting and reporting mechanisms and/or state reporting programs as they implement methane emissions reduction measures.

While oil and gas facilities will not need to report on GHG emissions until 2034 under the proposed rule, those facilities are still subject to the CAA section 111 methane emissions standards for new or modified sources and emissions guidelines for states to implement with respect to existing sources. A recent Interim Final Rule issued by EPA partially delayed compliance deadlines for the section 111 rules. Operators of new or modified facilities are still currently subject to fugitive emissions standards, such as leak detection and repair. EPA is considering revisions to the section 111 methane rules, and a proposed rulemaking is anticipated before the end of the year.

Companies like Voltpost are taking charging to new heights — somewhat literally — by mounting the hardware 10 feet off the ground on streetlamp posts to enable curbside charging, and remove the charging devices from the temptation of vandals and the more pedestrian obstacle of cables becoming tripping hazards.

Drivers activate a session with Voltpost via the mobile app, Jeffrey Prosserman, the company’s CEO and co-founder, said.

“Which sends a command to the Voltpost charger to release the cable,” he said in an email. “The retractable cable mechanism extends the cable downward. This is designed to provide up to 25 feet of cable to reach the vehicle’s charging port.”

The Voltpost Air, as the devices are known, is part of a pilot project at the MADE Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, N.Y., where it is due to be operational by the end of the year, officials said.

Voltpost’s more conventional curbside charging technology has been deployed in Illinois, Michigan, California and other states.

Chargers mounted to streetlamps are an obvious way to serve the many users of street parking, and another attempt to make charging infrastructure a ubiquitous part of the urban landscape — which is what consumers want to see more of, industry watchers said.

They also want chargers that work, according to a new report from ChargerHelp, which provides maintenance for the charging industry and concluded one-third of charging sessions fail on their first attempt, frustrating drivers and blunting EV enthusiasm.

Reasons behind the failures include a mix of confusion around how to use the devices, navigating glitchy apps, and aging equipment which is generally more prone to failure, Kameale Terry, ChargerHelp CEO, said.

“First, the charging experience has to be simpler for drivers,” Terry said via email, indicating this includes better signage and more user-friendly technology.

“There also needs to be consistent practices for firmware updates,” Terry said. “When it comes to aging infrastructure, swapping out a charger or refreshing a site might solve a short-term problem, but it doesn’t address the deeper issue: Technology moves faster than most charging site deployments.”

Today, roughly 64 percent of Americans live within 2 miles of a public EV charger, according to the Pew Research Center, with the number of charging locations more than doubling since 2020.

Lingering concerns related to range or the availability of charging locations continue to plague the U.S. market, even though vehicle range and the number of chargers coming online have both steadily grown, Ronak Amin, global product marketing lead for HERE Technologies, said last month, talking about a new report by HERE technologies and SBD Automotive examining the U.S. EV market.

Improving the charging experience is a key component in increasing the comfort level U.S. consumers have with the technology, Terry said, but it will require “better technology, smarter processes, and accountability across the ecosystem.”

“Overall, we’re incredibly optimistic about the EV transition. The progress in technology, investment, and adoption is real,” she said. “But that optimism has to be matched with honesty.”

To increase their convenience factor, Voltpost officials said the company will soon let users begin a charging session from a website landing page, eliminating the need to download a separate app.

While the vehicles have proven to be environmentally friendly and favorable, they pose new challenges for first responders.

When fire stations get the call that they will be dealing with an EV fire, they know they might be extinguishing the flames for a while.

On July 1, the Cortlandville Fire Department found itself on the end of a similar call.

“That one came in as a regular vehicle fire, a car fire on 81,” Fire Chief at the Cortlandville Fire Department Mike Biviano said. “As we were en route, they started updating: ‘This is believed to be an electric vehicle, hybrid fire.’ Which then prompted a little bit bigger response from us.”

The Moyers Corners Fire Department experienced a similar situation on October 12. Firefighters spent nearly two hours putting out an EV fire in the parking lot of the IHOP in Clay.

A regular car fire may require a crew to bring out an engine and a tanker full of water. But an EV fire often requires more resources.

“They take a lot more water to put out,” Biviano said. “You get into an electric vehicle fire, you’re talking thousands of gallons of water.”

Because of an EV’s lithium batteries, Biviano said they burn at extremely high temperatures and at a faster rate.

“It just takes a lot more water to put those out,” he said.

If you are an EV owner and your vehicle happens to catch on fire, Biviano said you should respond differently than if you are dealing with a regular engine.

“If you have a small fire extinguisher, give it one shot and get away,” he said.

If that doesn’t put out the fire, he recommends you get out as quickly and safely as possible, put as much distance between yourself and the vehicle as you can, and call 911.

But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel.","A Dutch company planning a sustainable aviation fuel production facility southeast of the Tri-Cities has cleared an important regulatory hurdle for the project.

State Department of Ecology officials in early September determined that SkyNRG’s manufacturing facility, being pursued by its North American unit SkyNRG Americas, would not create significant environmental impacts. The agency’s determination still set requirements for the company and project, from air and water quality precautions to mitigating reduction of habitat for ferruginous hawks.

But company officials said in a statement to the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business that Ecology’s decision is a critical milestone and they will continue to work with state and local stakeholders so the project continues to move forward.

“This brings SkyNRG closer to realizing a first-of-its-kind facility in the U.S. that will deliver domestic sustainable aviation fuel while advancing innovation and economic opportunity to Eastern Washington and across Washington,” said Nick Zollman of SkyNRG Americas in a statement.

SkyNRG’s facility will convert gaseous feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using chemical processes.

Once operating, the facility will produce an estimated 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel annually. It already has agreements in place with those wanting to buy its fuels.

SkyNRG has not released details about construction costs for the facility. Company officials have said construction will create up to 600 jobs and the facility itself about 100 jobs once production begins in 2029.

While federal policy toward some clean or renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has soured, sustainable aviation fuel has largely been spared similar treatment.

Congress’ passage of H.R. 1, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, scaled back credits for sustainable energy that were instituted a few years ago, such as those supporting the purchase of new and used electric vehicles or installing solar panels on homes.

But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit initially went through 2027 but now extends through 2029.

The Walla Walla County site provides access to transportation networks and potential synergy with other regional efforts to harness agricultural waste for energy production and other industrial purposes.

Washington State University is globally the top contributing organization to scientific literature in the sustainable aviation fuel field, based on an analysis of articles, papers, editorials and news items published between 2001-23.

Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory at WSU Tri-Cities and co-director of the WSU-Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Bioproducts Institute, was the most cited author.

The SkyNRG project is the one the state has thrown support behind. It received a $1.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, as part of the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

“This project aligns with our strategic growth priorities around clean technology and innovation,” said Joe Nguyen, director of the state Department of Commerce, in the statement announcing the grant. “In addition to furthering Washington’s leadership in clean energy and sustainable aviation, it creates family-wage manufacturing jobs that strengthen the local economy and community.”

SkyNRG has had to adjust its original plan to move forward. According to state documents, the company moved the facility to a different area of the business park than originally planned. The new site, located farther from the Columbia River, will have fewer environmental impacts.

Ecology’s recent determination also requires SkyNRG to make improvements to the intersection of Boise Cascade Road and Highway 12 if current state plans to widen and realign the highway don’t proceed. That is a possibility, as state and county officials propose further breaking up the next phase of expanding and rerouting the key route between the Tri-Cities and Walla Walla.

Zollman said the company is grateful for its partners as it looks to next steps.

“Important work lies ahead as we advance a project designed specifically to meet the benchmarks set by state and local partners,” he said.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/Focus/Construction%202025/Project-Wigeon-2025-layout-v2.jpg?height=635&t=1760371759&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 21:59:11.804696

China rarely telegraphs its diplomatic intentions so openly. Yet in recent days, Beijing has done just that — signalling that if Canada were to lift its tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles China would, in turn, remove the punitive tariffs it has placed on Canadian agricultural exports such as canola.

In the often-opaque world of trade diplomacy, such clarity is unusual. And in this case, it’s an unmistakable invitation to de-escalate. So far, Ottawa seems unwilling to take it.

This trade conflict began not in the fields of Saskatchewan or the ports of Vancouver, but in the politics of the global auto industry. In July, Canada joined the United States and the European Union in imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, citing concerns over industrial overcapacity, state subsidies and unfair competition. It was, in essence, an act of solidarity — a symbolic gesture to align with western allies rather than a measure grounded in Canada’s domestic economic reality.

After all, Chinese-made EVs make up less than 2% of vehicle sales in Canada. There was no surge threatening Canadian automakers. The tariff served a diplomatic purpose, not an industrial one.

Beijing’s response, however, has been deeply economic — and devastating. In March, China retaliated by imposing 100% tariffs on canola oil, canola meal and peas, along with 25% tariffs on pork and seafood. Then in August, it escalated further by slapping a 75.8% anti-dumping duty on Canadian canola seed — effectively closing the door on one of Canada’s most important export markets.

The financial fallout has been severe. Within two weeks of the August announcement, Canadian farmers were estimated to have lost $140 million. Canola futures dropped roughly $40 per tonne and the Canola Council of Canada projects total damages could reach $1.5 billion this year alone.

Before this dispute, China purchased over $5 billion worth of Canadian canola products annually, accounting for nearly 40% of our total exports in that category. That trade has now all but vanished. Prairie producers are scrambling to redirect shipments to Japan, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates — but at heavily discounted prices.

STRAINED ECONOMIC SECTOR

Meanwhile, the sector’s broader economics are already strained. In 2024, net cash income for Canadian farms fell by 15% to $19.7 billion, while interest expenses surged almost 29%. Add tariffs that block billions in exports and the math simply doesn’t work.

Ottawa has responded with limited support: Higher AgriStability coverage (from 80% to 90%), expanded interest-free cash advances and loan deferrals through Farm Credit Canada. These programs offer temporary liquidity, but do not restore lost markets. They keep farmers afloat, but don’t help them sell their crops.

Canada’s stance makes little sense. The country is defending a fledgling EV policy that protects virtually no domestic manufacturing base, while undermining one of its most globally competitive sectors — agriculture. It is, frankly, a case of policy misalignment: Protecting an industry that barely exists, while punishing one that feeds the world.

And now the way out is staring us in the face. China’s message through its ambassador is clear: Remove your EV tariffs and we will remove ours. For Beijing to make such a conditional offer publicly is extraordinary. In diplomatic language, that’s as close as one gets to a negotiated exit without a formal agreement.

By refusing to engage, Ottawa is not defending Canadian sovereignty — it is sacrificing Canadian prosperity. Every day this dispute drags on, farmers lose income, communities lose stability and Canada loses credibility as a reliable trade partner.

The potential upside of a policy shift is enormous. Dropping the EV tariffs would cost Canada virtually nothing — the affected imports represent a rounding error in national trade data — but it could immediately reopen up to $5 billion in annual canola exports and relieve pressure on the broader agri-food sector.

Canada’s role in global trade has always been built on pragmatism, not ideology. Our competitive advantage lies in feeding the world, not in fighting symbolic battles over industries we don’t have.

Farmers don’t need political theatre. They need access to markets. Ottawa’s duty is not to make gestures, but to make sense.

China has made its position clear. Now it’s Canada’s turn to act — with reason, not rhetoric.

VW’s hybrid push is not simply cosmetic.
From the Beetle to the Golf, to derivatives like the Bus, VW built its identity on modular, scalable architecture.","(TestMiles) – Volkswagen’s journey in America has always been a dance between heritage and innovation. From the humble Beetle to the bold ID series, VW’s product planning philosophy under the guidance of leaders like Serban Boldea remains grounded in creating value, platform efficiency, and brand consistency. In today’s climate of electrification, trade volatility, and consumer demand for SUVs and hybrids, VW’s legacy thinking may be its strongest weapon.

Why does this matter right now?

We’re at a pivot in the industry: hybrid adoption is surging as a bridge between combustion and full-electric models. According to Automotive Research, 77 percent of U.S. repair shops have already seen more hybrid vehicles in their bays. Meanwhile, VW has publicly committed to HEVs as part of a premium reorientation in markets like the U.S.

Combine that with looming trade pressures, software differentiation, and supply chain shifts, and VW’s product planning decisions could determine whether it leads or lags. The lessons from the Beetle, Golf, and Bus still echo today in decisions about shared platforms and product spacing.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rival brands, Toyota, Honda, Ford, lean heavily on hybrid or full-electric transitions with strong economies of scale. VW’s advantage lies in its platform legacy: VW’s MQB architecture already underpins SUVs like the Atlas, enabling flexibility in body styles and powertrain options. Boldea outlined how moving the firewall forward and optimizing interior packaging gave the Atlas a roomy cabin on relatively compact footprints.

However, rivals often enjoy more aggressive branding and marketing in the U.S. EV space. Tesla, Ford’s EV push, and Hyundai’s aggressive hybrid/EV rollout put VW in a competitive catch-up mode. VW’s focus on internal platform consistency is a strength, but some critics argue it’s too conservative in software and marketing muscle.

VW’s hybrid push is not simply cosmetic. The automaker has said it will prioritize conventional hybrid models rather than plug-in hybrids in the U.S., reducing weight, complexity, and cost burdens. That decision contrasts with many rivals who are doubling down on PHEVs or pure BEVs.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you’re a VW fan, a buyer weighing between hybrid SUVs, or someone watching how legacy automakers fight for relevance, you’ll find this deeply relevant. Analysts, engineers, and platform nerds will appreciate the behind-the-scenes reasoning about space utilization, cost control, and brand heritage.

If, however, you’re only looking for quick EV comparisons or short-term deals, this is not your how-to pick guide. This is about strategy over shiny features.

What is the long-term significance?

Platform thinking is VW’s core competitive moat. From the Beetle to the Golf, to derivatives like the Bus, VW built its identity on modular, scalable architecture. Today, the leap into hybrid and electric architectures must preserve that DNA or risk diluting the brand.

Nostalgia plays a role. Boldea referenced the original Beetle and Bus when discussing retro revivals like the ID Buzz, which mimics classic proportions thanks to its EV layout. Yet, recreating those proportions under modern safety rules is only viable in electric architecture. The Bus or a revived Thing with an ICE setup would compromise form and function.

Volkswagen’s broader group strategy aims to balance strong software, electrification, and platform resilience through 2035. That means shared cell design, digital ecosystems, and a leaner product stack. Their “Transform 2025+” roadmap underscores the intention to reimagine brand positioning while leveraging core.

The hybrid bridge, platform synergy, and carefully chosen retro revivals are pieces in a larger chess game. Time will tell whether VW’s disciplined ethos beats rivals’ aggressive gambits.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/ID.Buzz_.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-13 21:00:41.722116

Federal workers are preparing to auction off logging rights in three national forests in Oregon, despite the government shutdown. That is because the workers were deemed essential after President Trump issued an executive order earlier this year expanding U.S. timber production. Now, Trump also promised to reverse what's called the roadless rule, a ban on logging in almost 60 million acres of national forests. Here's NPR's Kirk Siegler.

KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: While still steady, Oregon's timber industry is a fraction of what it was back in the boom times when a lot more trees were being cut on U.S. Forest Service land. For the last two decades, most of the logs rolling into sawmills like this have been cut off private land. In the old timber town of Cottage Grove, Sean Smith runs the family owned Starfire Lumber. He says Trump's push to revive logging on public forests is generally well-received, but there's an asterisk.

SEAN SMITH: I mean, I think his heart is in the right place. But when you consider the moving parts...

SIEGLER: Mills like his are feeling pinched right now, not because they can't get enough logs, but because lumber prices are low. Opening up more public lands to logging could eventually help his margins, but he doubts that'll happen fast. And today's environmental laws mean timber sales take more time to plan, or they get tied up in court.

SMITH: When you consider that you have not only land management agencies but also fish and wildlife agencies that have to sign off on things...

SIEGLER: He says the president can't just sign an executive order and expect the woods around here to get cut down. Congress must pass a long-term forest policy.

SMITH: I mean, we don't live in a dictatorship. And I, for one, I'm OK with that (laughter). I hope most Americans are.

SIEGLER: Smith adds that so many people have left the timber industry since the 1990s after the notorious timber wars, when the endangered spotted owl led to the forest service dramatically curtailing timber sales on public land. Some 400 mills across the northwest closed, a loss of 35,000 jobs. And even if there was a new boom, many mill owners say it'd be hard to find enough people in rural Oregon who want to work in sawmills these days. Alex Owen (ph) started at Starfire in 2011 and worked his way up to sawmill supervisor.

ALEX OWEN: For me, I like the high pace. But with all the internet jobs out there today, a lot of the younger kids don't want to do the manual labor that this requires.

SIEGLER: President Trump is banking on that changing. His executive order on expanding American timber production says foreign lumber imports have stifled job creation. And further, Trump officials say reversing the 2001 roadless rule will return common sense to forest management. But right now in Oregon, it's widely known that the forest service doesn't have enough money to maintain its existing roads and isn't even meeting its timber harvest targets in forests that are already developed.

CHANDRA LEGUE: It's really that backlog that can be capitalized on without entering these pristine areas that have never been cut before.

SIEGLER: Huge ferns carpet the understory of a roadless forest that Chandra LeGue is hiking through near the college town of Eugene.

LEGUE: We are walking through a forest of western hemlock and Douglas fir.

SIEGLER: Environmentalists like LeGue of Oregon Wild also point to mechanization. So even if more forests are open to logging, there may not be many new jobs.

LEGUE: You know, this area, yeah, at one time, timber was king in western Oregon. Our economy has diversified immensely.

SIEGLER: It's likely national environmental groups will sue if the administration fast-tracks repealing the roadless rule without the required environmental analysis. But for Nick Smith with the Portland-based trade group American Forest Resource Council, reversing that rule isn't about a timber boom. It's more about cutting red tape for smaller thinning and fire prevention projects.

NICK SMITH: We do not mean industrial-style clear cuts, but the real work that needs to be done to restore these forests and make them more resilient to wildfire and climate change.

SIEGLER: But right now, everything - wildfires, workforce or environment pressures - feels like it's being overshadowed by a bigger unknown, the economy.

(SOUNDBITE OF TOOL SAWING)

SIEGLER: Back at Starfire, owner Sean Smith made the tough decision the other day to stop bringing in any new logs into his yard. Lumber prices remain soft due to sluggish home construction. A mill down the road just closed.

SMITH: The cynical observation you often hear is the price of everything goes up except lumber.

SIEGLER: For now, his mill is running full tilt, one shift a day. And Smith is hoping the drop in demand is just a typical seasonal thing going into winter.

Aluminium has long been a mainstay of bicycle manufacturing; it's a lightweight, durable, and relatively affordable material. You’ll find it in everything from entry-level commuters to premium race road bikes, and it's widely used in components like cranks, handlebars, and seat posts. It's lauded as both an affordable and relatively sustainable material. But beyond noting the fact that aluminium is recyclable, the cycling industry has long been quiet about the supply chain and the sustainability credentials behind the material.

Despite its technical recyclability, aluminium’s environmental impact is heavily front-loaded. The mining, refining, and smelting processes that produce raw aluminium are deeply energy-intensive, and unless that energy comes from renewables, the carbon footprint is massive. Although closed-loop recycling is theoretically possible, it remains rare in practice, especially for products like bike frames that have to comply with safety standards.

It's also taken decades of using this material for the cycling industry to finally have a closer look at its environmental impact. Trek, among others, has made it a focus in its sustainability efforts, and admitted that the metal is a key hotspot in its emissions.

Joel Demeritt, Trek's sustainability lead, told Escape Collective that up until identifying that issue, Trek's sustainability efforts were mostly focused on plastics, packaging, and renewable energy at the manufacturing level. ""We realised after doing [an analysis] that we would never hit our goals without addressing metals,"" Demeritt explained.

What Trek has identified applies to the wider cycling industry. The following is a closer look at how aluminium becomes a bike, a handlebar, or a crankset – and how companies are trying to make the process less damaging. Escape Collective spoke with engineers, product managers and sustainability leads at Trek, SRAM, Merida, Standert and other brands, and consulted the Outdoor Industry Association's Aluminium Guidebook to detail how the bicycle industry operates as part of the much larger global metals economy.

The complicated origins of aluminium

""Just the production of aluminium raw material is about 45% of our carbon footprint,"" Nick Myhre, sustainability and strategy lead at SRAM, admitted. And SRAM is far from being alone with that figure in the cycling industry.

The Aluminium Guidebook and the wider aluminium industry point to similar figures; emissions from electricity during smelting account for over 71% of aluminium's total lifecycle emissions, and the rest come from the refinement and anode production. Despite this, brands have historically paid little attention to the upstream emissions embedded in what is often dubbed an eco-friendly material. Much of that is down to the energy-intensive manufacturing process that aluminium goes through.

But instead, the pickup’s luster is continuing to wear thin.

According to Cox Automotive’s latest EV sales report, Tesla sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks in the third quarter, down 62.6% from a year earlier. The decline came as the broader U.S. EV market posted its strongest quarter on record, with sales up nearly 30% to more than 438,000 vehicles. Ford sold almost twice as many electric F-150 Lightning trucks in the same quarter, while even Chevrolet’s fledgling Silverado EV and Rivian’s R1T gained ground.

The Cybertruck comparison is slightly distorted by timing — Q3 2024 captured the truck’s early ramp — but even adjusting for that, deliveries have slowed, and orders have thinned. And the sales drop came even as buyers rushed to lock in federal EV tax credits before they expired in late September, a policy boost that's now in the rearview mirror.

Tesla still commands about 41% of the EV market, but its share has slipped from nearly half last year — and the company’s stainless-steel pickup is the biggest drag on its lead. The company’s core models still move volume, but its more ambitious projects — from the Cybertruck to the long-promised robotaxi — are proving harder to scale than to hype.

When Musk unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, its $39,990 price tag, Blade Runner aesthetic, and millions of preorders looked like a dare to Detroit. But nearly six years later, the sticker shock has flipped. The cheapest version now starts above $60,000, and early adopters are discovering that the attention-grabbing angles don’t make for a particularly practical ride.

The Model Y remains the country’s best-selling EV by far, yet Tesla’s total share has fallen eight points in a year as rivals finally scale up. What was once a moat of innovation is now crowded with well-funded competition, and the Cybertruck’s sharp edges (and fit and finish issues) are beginning to look like a distraction.

The Cybertruck was meant to signal Tesla’s next era — a company moving beyond sedans and SUVs into America’s most profitable vehicle class. Instead, the model is revealing Tesla’s limits. Demand elsewhere may remain robust, but the truck is exposing how hard it is to act like a disruptor once you’ve become the incumbent.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2232243084.jpg",N,,2025-10-13 18:03:10.340793

This idea builds on the technology of pumped storage, which has been gaining attention as a way to enhance renewable energy capacity. Unlike traditional hydroelectric dams that can disrupt ecosystems and communities, this method uses existing lakes and reservoirs to store and generate energy. As the demand for sustainable energy solutions grows, this innovative approach could play a crucial role in meeting our energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.

Transforming Lakes: The New Face of Hydropower

The concept of converting lakes into power plants is not entirely new but has seen renewed interest due to its potential for sustainable energy production. Traditional hydropower has long relied on massive dams, which, despite their efficiency, often lead to significant ecological and social disruptions. Instead, the emerging technology known as pumped storage aims to utilize the natural geography of lakes and reservoirs, reducing the need for new dams.

This system involves two reservoirs at different elevations. When there is excess electricity from nearby power plants, it is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir. This process effectively “charges” the system like a battery. When energy demand peaks, the stored water is released back down through turbines to generate electricity. This innovative approach harnesses the gravitational power of water without the need for large-scale infrastructure projects, making it a more environmentally friendly option.

Revisiting Pumped Storage: An Old Idea with New Potential

Pumped storage is not a novel concept, but its relevance is growing as the world seeks reliable renewable energy sources. As wind and solar power continue to expand, the need for energy storage solutions becomes more pressing. Pumped storage offers a viable answer to the intermittency problem associated with these renewable sources. By storing excess energy during periods of low demand, it ensures a steady supply when energy needs spike.

Remarkably, some of the largest pumped storage systems can supply enough power for two million U.S. homes for an hour. While China has been at the forefront of renewable energy growth, including pumped storage, the United States is also exploring its potential. The ability to store and release energy efficiently is crucial for transitioning to a low-carbon future, making pumped storage an attractive option for many regions.

Rethinking Hydropower: Run-of-River Plants

While pumped storage is gaining traction, other types of hydropower technology are also being explored. Run-of-river hydropower plants provide a less invasive alternative to traditional dams. These systems are built on rivers without creating large reservoirs, relying instead on the natural flow of water to generate electricity. This approach minimizes the environmental impact and reduces the risk of catastrophic failures in seismically active areas.

Particularly prevalent in mountainous regions like Nepal, run-of-river plants offer a sustainable way to harness hydropower without the adverse effects associated with large dams. This adaptability makes it possible to implement hydropower solutions in diverse geographical settings, expanding the potential for renewable energy generation worldwide.

The Future of Energy: Potential Projects in the United States

In the United States, the potential for lake-based power plants is being explored through ambitious projects. One such initiative involves diverting water from the Great Lakes to create a lower-altitude reservoir. This setup would generate electricity from the gravitational flow of water, similar to the pumped storage concept.

Although the project faced delays due to the pandemic, there is renewed interest in resuming and expanding these efforts. By transforming existing natural features into energy assets, the U.S. could significantly boost its renewable energy capacity while preserving ecological balance. The success of these projects would mark a significant step forward in sustainable energy development, potentially serving as a model for other regions around the world.

As we continue to search for sustainable energy solutions, the idea of converting lakes into power plants presents an intriguing possibility. This approach not only leverages existing natural resources but also aligns with the global push towards renewable energy. As these projects gain momentum, the question remains: can this innovative technology be the key to achieving a sustainable energy future while maintaining ecological harmony?

Joe Lombardo (R) raised concern about economic impacts to growing state industries such as data centers and mining if solar energy projects are curtailed or delayed.","Threats from the Trump administration to curtail already awarded federal funds and approvals for U.S. clean energy development have revved up in recent days—with the U.S. Interior Dept. reversing its sign-off to proceed on the 6.2-GW Esmeralda Seven solar and battery project in Nevada, while the U.S. Dept. of Energy targets hundreds of previously awarded clean energy grants worth an estimated $24 billion.

Interior said Oct. 10 that it cancelled a key approval for the Esmeralda project, to be located about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nev., on department owned land, in an agreement with firms developing its seven contiguous sections. Together, they are set to produce 6.2 GW of clean power and be a leading energy supplier in the state. The ""programmatic review"" action, quietly taken and noted in an agency website statement, followed the Trump order to freeze clean energy project permits. Interior released the Esmeralda project draft environmental review early this year and had promised final approval, the record of decision, in July. Among key project developers are NextEra Energy, Invenergy, Leeward Energy and ConnectGen.

Interior did not cancel the entire 62,000-acre project, a department spokesperson told media, but directed developers to resubmit parcels for new approval separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” if they choose to continue development.

Among developers responding to media, a NextEra Energy spokesperson said on Oct. 10 the firm was “in the early stage of development and remains committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with [the department.] A spokesperson for Leeward Energy said it had “no information to share regarding the project update.”

Among other administration rule changes mandated in July, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum now has to personally approve all “environmentally damaging” solar and wind energy projects on public lands, requiring the department to consider “capacity density” when evaluating projects, which observers said could be a barrier due to their space needs.

At the same time, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said he was ending the $7 billion national Solar for All program that offered states grants to develop solar energy for low-income households. In September, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture said it would no longer fund solar projects on productive farmland, a policy change from the Biden administration. Earlier in October, a group of solar installation firms and nonprofits, and the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, sued EPA in federal court in Providence, R.I., claiming the agency action was illegal.

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) raised concern about economic impacts to growing state industries such as data centers and mining if solar energy projects are curtailed or delayed. Nevada ranked fourth in the U.S. last year in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources, comprising 31% of the state's total power generation, said the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said Interior needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”

Despite Esmeralda's clean energy appeal, some environmental advocates opposed it for its impacts to a pristine area. Advocacy group Basin and Range Watch and others sued Interior in May for not considering Esmeralda Seven in its environmental review of Greenlink West, a 472-mile, multibillion-dollar transmission line from the Reno area to Las Vegas to move energy from rural areas to Nevada urban centers. While that project's federal approvals are also at risk, NV Energy is moving ahead to build the project, said a spokeswoman.

Opponents speculated whether Esmeralda Seven's developers would actually resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration"" add new layers of complication, said one. Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said the cancelled review “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”

DOE Eyes Billions More in Funding Cuts

The Esmeralda reversal comes as a list developed by the U.S. Energy Dept. of hundreds of clean power project federal grant recipients targeted for termination became public through media pickup—possibly totaling an added $12 billion beyond $7.56 billion the agency already announced earlier this month would terminate.

The group includes some 600 grant recipient names, with about half on the earlier announced list and total funding of nearly $24 billion, according to the document. Media speculate the list was leaked, with possible intent to use the cuts as leverage.

On the list was funding for carbon capture projects in development by oil giants ExxonMobil and Occidental as well as hundreds of millions provided to electric vehicle manufacturing sites built or under construction by Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Stellantis and Volvo.

Canada, however, appears to be is moving to capture carbon capture market share the U.S. rejects. Montreal-based technology startup Deep Sky said on Oct. 9 that it will build what it said would be one of the world’s largest direct air capture projects, an estimated $500-million plant in Manitoba at a not-yet chosen site. Set to start construction next year, the facility would be able to remove 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere, Deep Sky said. No contractor selection was announced. ""Canada has the opportunity to become the carbon removal capital of the world, and capture the jobs and economic opportunity that will come with it,” said Alex Petre, Deep Sky CEO.

Also on the Trump hit list are new funding cuts that could total more than $4.5 billion, to five U.S. hydrogen hubs, including those focused on deriving the fuel from natural gas, in addition to two in California and Pacific Northwest focused on renewables-based hydrogen that lost $2.2 billion previously.

Those now facing cuts are: HyVelocity hub located on the Gulf Coast; the Midwest and mid-Atlantic hubs; the Appalachian hub in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania; and the Heartland hub in the Dakotas, Montana, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Burgum had supported the latter as North Dakota governor, while Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) previously voiced concern about Trump cuts to the Appalachian hub's $925 million in federal funding.

DOE officials have not officially confirmed specific cuts. ""We have been unable to verify the documents referenced. No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,"" DOE chief spokesperson Ben Dietderich told ENR. The agency ""continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/10/12/BLM.ESMERALDA.-SOLARSITE.jpeg?height=635&t=1760378105&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 17:00:52.172737

Emily Flippen: The landscape of commerce is turning increasingly social. EV demand has been dampening, and are tariffs actually working? We'll discuss today on Motley Fool Money.

I'm Emily Flippen. Today, I'm joined by analysts Jason Hall and Dan Caplinger to discuss how the sale of TikTok in the United States could change the way we shop here at the start of Prime Day, as well as expectations for demand for electric vehicles now that domestic EV tax credits have expired. But first, I think it's worth taking a deeper look at whether or not we can call tariffs a success. I suspect all of our listeners are already familiar with the tariffs that the Trump administration has sought to implement over the course of the past year. Most empirical evidence says that, generally speaking, tariffs don't spur economic growth. In fact, most economists and investors speculated that they would actually cause profits to drop, stocks to fall, consumer spending to ease, and inflation to rise. But so far, it doesn't really seem like that's been the case. In fact, it's really been the opposite. Stocks are up. The economy has been really resilient, and inflation does seem to be moderating. Jason, when you look at this picture in terms of the economic policies we're seeing here, is it too early to call tariffs a relative success?

Jason Hall: I think if you're talking about the administration's goal of boosting US manufacturing, it's definitely way too early. So far, the only industries that have really been helped are the ones where there's already an entrenched base. You think about metals production, steel manufacturing. They've basically gotten a free license to increase their prices based on the tariffs that are in place on imports in those industries. You look at other manufacturing industries like the auto industry, whole building construction is a massive buyer of manufactured goods. They've actually been net hurt because they rely on a lot of imported goods, and the US just can't flip the switch quickly to produce those goods domestically. The agricultural sector has been impacted. We've seen countries like China has pulled back on buying US soybeans because of reciprocal tariffs, and tariffs on Chinese goods that are imported into the US. Semiconductor companies are feeling a huge pinch in China. Chinese companies are basically being told don't buy US chips unless you have no other choice. You look at the stock market, guys, this is an AI story. A JP Morgan analyst put out a research note, and he pointed out that since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022, three quarters of the S&P 500 returns have come from AI-related companies. Over that same period, 80% of the S&P 500's earnings growth has come from those companies. If you start peeling back the layers, it's obvious that we have a bifurcated market and economy. Plenty of companies are not doing well. In a lot of cases, because tariffs are either increasing their costs and/or putting pressure on already squeezed consumers who have been feeling the pinch from inflation for four years now.

Emily Flippen: I think it's a fair point that there's clearly this disconnect that's happening between what consumers are feeling and what the stock market is doing and what investors are experiencing. But if the stock market isn't actually the correct indicator of how well the economy is doing it, that's not the barometer we're looking at. If that's not the scoreboard, Dan, when you look at it, what is the right gauge for gauging or judging success?

Dan Caplinger: Well, I think there's a couple of directions that you can go with that, Emily. The first is to judge it from the goals that the administration had. I think that one of the primary goals that the Trump administration had was to make companies, both foreign and domestic, have the internal conversation. Are we interested in expanding US manufacturing capacity? Are we interested in sourcing more products that go to US consumers from US sources? That's the goal. I think those conversations are happening that they have taken place. As Jason said, the answer is not always going to be necessarily what the administration wanted, but they've definitely been able to define the conversation. They've been able to set the subject and put that in front of people, and let those folks come to whatever conclusions they have for their businesses. I think for big businesses, like Jason said, it's not always going to be a matter of flipping the switch, but it is a matter of if they make the decision to move more production and sourcing to US, that's going to be an option for them. It's the small businesses that I think have more trouble. Emily, I live in the middle of nowhere in Western Massachusetts. No big cities near me. There are plenty of small businesses that really did rely on cheaper goods from other countries in order to keep afloat. These tariffs, they are the marginal companies. They are the companies that are having to go out of business because of the extra costs due to the tariffs. They don't have the margins to be able to absorb those tariffs temporarily. That's the distinction that I see. The other thing that I think is a real issue is not so much the tariffs themselves, but the uncertainty surrounding how long are tariffs going to be in place? Are they going to be permanent? Is the rate going to change? Is it going to go up? Is it going to go down? It's impossible for businesses to have a good long-term sense of, OK, if an investment is going to take 5-10 years to pay off, is the policy just going to change back? Or is it going to get worse? Or am I making a smart decision? It's just really difficult to figure that out.

Jason Hall: That's exactly right, Dan. It takes years to transition manufacturing and supply chains. We're six months into this, guys. The bigger question that I think we don't know the answer to is will US buyers, whether it's consumers or businesses, are they going to be willing to soak up the higher cost to manufacture more things domestically? According to an American Enterprise Institute study, there's about $1.7 trillion in goods that the administration is targeting to try to bring to domestic manufacturing, and it would cost about 21% more to manufacture them at home. That's an extra $257 billion a year. Plus, there's another $348 billion in tariffs that the AEI estimates would have to remain in place to keep that US manufacturing competitive. That's $606 billion a year that American buyers would have to pay for the same goods we're buying today. I mentioned AI before. Maybe this is the problem that AI can help solve.

Dan Caplinger: Being a little glib.

Jason Hall: But maybe that actually is part of the answer.

Emily Flippen: Dare to dream here. I have to say, I think that part of the impact and part of the reason why there is that disconnect is just because we haven't felt the full force of the economic brunt of these tariffs. I saw some interesting data that was collected by Bloomberg over the course of the past month. They tracked more than two dozen of Temu. That is the shopping site owned by Pinduoduo, PDD Holdings, their most popular products. They found that their prices actually fell nearly 20% between April and September because they were attempting to make up for some of the costs that consumers were going to be paying for these tariffs. Further data collected by Goldman Sachs has shown that even American businesses have taken on the majority of the brunt of the cost of tariff impacts, that shoe will have to drop eventually, which is to say they can't continue to take on the impacts of tariffs to your point. Dan, we don't know exactly how long they're going to continue, what they could look like over the long term. Right now, consumers aren't bearing the full impact. I expect that, especially as we go into the holiday season, if we start to see some of those price increases come down the line, and businesses, whether they be domestic or foreign start to pass along those price increases, that's when we'll really start to see the economic impacts, and that's when we'll start to have it show up in our economic data as well. Up next, we'll be moving to the other side of the purchase equation to discuss TikTok, Prime Day, and how social commerce has redefined the shopping experience. Stick with us.

Today is the first day of Prime Day, and we're all underwhelmed. It seems like despite posting record dollars every year, a results that I have no doubt is driven by mainly inflation, enthusiasm from shoppers just always feel increasingly diffused year after year. Dan, when you look at Prime Day and social commerce in general, is this just a combination of weaker economic conditions or just shoppers changing the way that they're shopping or is it just something else entirely?

Dan Caplinger: I'm embarrassed to say that when we first talked about this topic, I was like, ""Whoa, it's going to be Prime Day again? Wasn't it just Prime Day like a few months ago?"" That's the thing is that we've been having Prime Day. Consumers like fresh concepts, fresh ideas. Prime Day is maybe hitting it past its prime, perhaps. It's been going on for 10 years now. It's a long time to keep it new, keep it interesting, keep it front and center. Amazon's done what they can to try to build and iterate and make it more interesting, but it's faced a bunch of problems. One is that the rest of retail said, ""Okay. Fine, Amazon, you want to create this new holiday for shopping in the middle of the year? Well, we'll be happy to sell to our customers at the same time on the same days as well."" It's not just Amazon having this random sale in the middle of the year. It's everybody else now jumping onto that and saying, ""Hey, people are in the mood to buy. Why don't you buy from us instead of them?"" Amazon hasn't really been able to maintain exclusive ownership of the event. The other thing I think is, keep in mind, Amazon, the original goal of Prime Day, probably first and foremost, was to try to get people to sign up for Amazon Prime, for the subscription service. Back in 2015, there were a lot of people who weren't Prime members. But 10 years later, there are a lot of Prime members. It's almost mission accomplished. There's just not that many people left to sign up. As a result, I think Amazon is facing this existential question with Prime Day. It's like, what do we want it this to be going forward? We've already done a great job of increasing our market share of the number of shoppers in the US and elsewhere who are Prime members. At the same time, plenty of other reasons to join Prime outside to shopping. It may be time for a reset, I think.

Jason Hall: Dan, I think it's more an indictment of you and me in our demographic, because you're not the only GenX dude on this podcast that did not realize that Prime Day was starting. Guys, I spend an embarrassingly large amount of money on Amazon every single week. That's the bottom line. But here's the thing. Literally, guys, as I'm typing out the outline, I get a text from my wife, and I'm going to read it to you guys now. I quote, ""I've got a slap full Amazon cart for Prime Day. I want to chat about it with you."" I don't really know if there's really anything else to say. We're not really the target anymore for that, but here's the other thing that I think maybe matters more. The noise around social shopping is pretty loud right now, but if there's anything we've learned from social media is that it's a great marketing channel, but literally nowhere across social media, his shopping is a habitual thing stuck. Facebook has tried it. Twitter has tried marketing. We've seen Pinterest make fits and starts attempts, and there's not a better social platform than Pinterest to be e-commerce. I think it may be a thing that maybe drives fashion trends and that thing, but it's more a top of the funnel. I think shopping is just a habitual thing. If you look at the numbers, again, we know that the lower and middle income consumers are the ones being squeezed. We can look at McDonald's and Amazon competitor Walmart as just some data points I think support it. McDonald's comps were 2.5% last quarter at the same source sales growth. That's lower than inflation. Walmart's revenue was up 5% in the second quarter. It's e-commerce sales are up 25%. That shows you there's still a lot of pressure. Then thinking about those inflation and tariff that we talked about before, GAAP operating income was actually down 8% and flat on an adjusted basis. I don't think we're going to see some massive disruption of retail from what's going on with TikTok potentially becoming US company or any of those sorts of things. It's just a tough time for consumers right now, and these big companies are feeling that pinch.

Emily Flippen: I actually disagree, Jason.

Jason Hall: I love the fact that you disagree.

Emily Flippen: I think you're right. Conceptually, big picture, you're right. But I do think when you look at social commerce in general, especially the way it operates in international geographies versus here in the United States, it just shows how people tend to engage with what they were raised on or habitualized. There's so many Prime shoppers, for instance, that were habitualized with buying on Amazon. To your point, Dan, it's no longer really about getting people to sign up for Prime. It's just a reminder you're mostly doing all your shopping on Amazon anyway, so it's just an excuse to maybe buy one or two extra things that went on sale today or maybe you delayed purchasing until they were on sale. When I look at the way that social commerce and e-commerce was built in places like China, back when mobile phones were accessible at the same exact time, credit cards were accessible. It just the way that people were going about purchasing and shopping was built on social before it was built on sites like Amazon. That has become habitual process of purchasing internationally. I don't necessarily think it has taken off in the United States exactly the same way it has internationally, but I think TikTok has been that turning point for buyers, and it's Prime Day every day on TikTok, so to speak. I worry a little bit big picture that the sale of TikTok could cause some people to either lose faith or engagement in the platform long-term, but I don't think that the idea of social commerce and purchasing based on trends or engagement with influencers, whatever it may be, I don't think that trend is going to go away, even if it shifts off of sites like TikTok. I am happy that Amazon has Amazon Web Services, which is generating something like 60% of its operating profit because Amazon, in my opinion, has been very slow to adjust to the social commerce trends. I worry a little bit that as we start to age out of the demographic here for commerce that they're not going to do a great job of convincing younger shoppers that they need to have an Amazon Prime membership.

Dan Caplinger: For me, the question as it goes with TikTok is going to be, what do content producing influencers decide to do? Are they going to take the shift in ownership and treat that as a catalyst to make them consider alternatives? If they do that, then that's going to be a shift, and the marketing will then follow the influencers. I don't think that it's going to be an external decision where external marketers tell influencers that they need to leave TikTok. I think that that's probably going to be an influencer judge decision, and I'll be curious to see how it works out, because if there is a big exodus among influencers from the platform, the question is going to be, what platform do they go to? Then that becomes the next TikTok, and then that becomes the next target of regulation. Where does that circle end?

Jason Hall: All roads lead to AI. AI is going to be doing our shopping for us in five years, guys.

Emily Flippen: I dare to dream there, Jason. If it could take care of my shopping for me, I would definitely take it up on it. Listeners, before we move on to our last story of the day, that is electric vehicles, I do have a quick note.

Emily Flippen: I hope everybody has already made their car purchases because September 30th was the last day for Americans to qualify for their federal EV tax credits. Automakers have been dreading this drop off for months now, and it could have come at a worse time. Tesla has really struggled to maintain deliveries. Ford's CEO expects EV sales could drop by half, and BYD just posted its first monthly year-over-year sales decline in more than a year-and-a-half. Jason, do electric vehicles need to shift in policies to drive adoption or is this just a temporary speed bump?

Jason Hall: I think we're about to find out, Emily. I know that's not a direct answer here, and I'm dancing around it a little bit, but I don't think we completely know a couple things. Our cars writ large have continued to become more expensive. Car prices on average are up about 16 new car prices on average are up about 16% since March 2021, according to Kelley Blue Book. That's helping create a little more parity to the cost of an EV versus an internal combustion engine powered car. There's still cost pressures, but the EV industry is starting to benefit from some other things to bring costs down. Higher scale manufacturing for batteries, and then advanced battery technology, they are bringing battery costs down. That's a big thing. I think those things might help over the longer term. We just don't really know how it's going to play out in the near term.

Dan Caplinger: I just don't think that tax credits are necessarily the linchpin of what determines the success in the EV industry at this point. To me, the key to adoption is reliable infrastructure. I'll just tell you, charging anywhere other than Tesla Supercharger Network, it's just a nightmare. I mean, I'm the target audience for this. I would love to drive an electric vehicle, and the electric vehicles that I've driven, I love how they perform. It's just really good acceleration. It's just the handling is great. But I'll tell you, I went to Florida, and the only rental car that they had left was an EV, a non-Tesla EV. It changed the complexion of the entire trip because suddenly, I had range anxiety. I couldn't just up and go to the next city down the coast to go check out the beach there and not think about, OK, am I going to have enough charge to get back in time for dinner? Where am I going to go? What are the charging options going to be? They really need to get the infrastructure up to speed before EV adoption is really going to hit the mainstream. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that's going to happen because at the policy level, we used to have tailwinds that were inspiring companies to spend on improving infrastructure for electric vehicles. That now in the current administration has turned into headwinds, not just on the tax credit side, but just on broader policy priorities and energy policy. With no real appetite for investment, I don't have nearly the expectation for improvement in EV infrastructure that I did a year ago.

Emily Flippen: The economic equation, especially as it applies to energy right now in a more expensive world for energy has gotten more expensive for electric vehicles. Without the incentives, at least as the environment exists right now, it's really hard to make the math work for new car purchases to move electric versus traditional.

Jason Hall: Well, just on the purchaser side, if you look on the manufacturing side, Tesla's bottom line may be hit more because of the loss of some tax credits that they were able to sell to other automakers to offset some tax liability. That's billions of dollars a year in high margin revenue that is going to completely go away. Part of the answer for that Tesla, after we record this today, is supposed to be announcing a lower cost model. Why? I think as much as anything, that's an immediate evidence that the automakers are having to react quickly with cost cuts to be competitive. Let me just say this last thing. Besides Tesla and BYD, find another mass market automaker. I'm throwing Ferrari out here. That's a brand that they're selling. Find an automaker, EV or otherwise, that has been a market beating investments over the past decade, and you will not find them besides again, Tesla and BYD. Most of the other EV stocks, they've wiped out tens of billions in investor value. This is just a tough, brutal industry. Even Tesla's future is less tied to cars and more to AI, autonomy services, robotics, and those sorts of things. They need to make profit from cars to pay for that stuff, but this is just a tough industry. If I were an investor, looking in this space, I would immediately go find somewhere else where the tailwinds are tied to profits. Hey, guys, maybe artificial intelligence. What do you say?

Dan Caplinger: I do have to say, though, Jason, I think that Tesla does have the opportunity to extract even more money for supercharger access to the other automakers for exactly the reasons that you just mentioned. Because of these policy headwinds, that could be a nice addition to Tesla's cash cow business there that could help fund AI, robotics, automation, all those other priorities.

Emily Flippen: Well, as always, I like to sign off here with the lightning rounds. Maybe you'll have some more hot takes for us, Jason. We discussed a lot of things today, electric vehicles, online shopping, tariff policies, so I really want to put you both and myself included on the spot to maybe give one of our favorite stocks that's likely to benefit from one of the broader trends we talked about. Dan, let me go to you first.

Dan Caplinger: I'm going to mention Symbotic. This is ticker SYM on the NASDAQ. It's a company. It's been heavily involved in improving warehouse storage technology, basically automating the warehouse with autonomous robots that help streamline movement of goods inside of those facilities, make the supply chain more efficient. I think that that company potentially benefits both from tariff-related pushes to get more manufacturing and warehousing back onshore, as well as just the overall positive trends in e-commerce over time.

Jason Hall: Well, I've mentioned AI a ton of time, so I might as well stick with that. Dan, you brought up robotics in warehouses, and this just lines up perfectly. Let's talk about Amazon again. It's winning from AI with its own AI-driven products. AWS, a lot of compute to build artificial intelligence is happening at AWS. We know that's the profit driver there, as you mentioned. Emily, it's starting to supercharge its Alexa products with AI. It's using AI to help shoppers. Also, hat tip to Dan on this one. Like I said, guys, it's one of the largest robotics companies on Earth, and people sometimes forget about that. I think it's later this year, if they haven't already passed it, Amazon will have actually deployed more robots in its warehouse than human workers. That's a big leg up in driving those costs down, Dan. Like you said, that helps offset the impact of tariffs and also labor inflation on its bottom line. One last thing, I'll do a little Steve Jobs here, too. Let's not forget about Zoox. That's the autonomous right hailing start-up that Amazon bought back in 2020. Largely, guess what? They got a lot of great AI and robotic stuff that's part of that. Three decades later, Amazon's still square in the middle of all of the innovations that are going to be changing the world for decades to come.

Emily Flippen: Well, now, I feel very insecure about the stock that I was going to go with because I feel sold. I'd never heard of Symbotic before, Dan, and you're staying. Of course, I know Amazon, and maybe my skepticism there on the commerce side is unwarranted, but I was actually going to go with BYD. The ticker is BYDDY.

Jason Hall: One of the only winners in the EV space. This is a great choice.

Emily Flippen: Well, I will say, I take to heart what you mentioned about the fact that cars have traditionally or automobile manufacturers have traditionally not been great investments. It's a pretty heavily commoditized space. They compete really heavily on price. But the reason why I like BYD, I mean, this is a battery company at its heart with a management team that has been incredibly focused on what I think is most important to win in this space, which is efficiency. BYD is really the only low-cost electric vehicle manufacturer that is managing to make vehicles worldwide at a rate that is, in my opinion, accessible to the average person. When we talk about the economic decision making for car purchases, being really against adoption of electric vehicles right now, that means the lowest cost model probably is the one that wins. I'm disappointed that we don't have more updates out from Tesla on the day that we're taping this. We're owed it today. Hasn't come out by the time that we're finishing taping. Maybe Tesla will eventually come out with their low-cost model, but BYD, in my opinion, is just leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to the accessibility of low-cost electric vehicles. That's going, in my opinion, really underappreciated by American investors. Well, fools, we hope that that was a hopefully somewhat interesting and useful podcast. We discussed lots of different topics. Ending here with some of our favorite investments that hopefully everybody could consider potentially adding to their portfolios. Jason and Dan, thank you both so much for joining today.

Dan Caplinger: Thanks, Emily.

Q: How Does New Texas Corporate Law Affect Merger and Acquisition Processes?","Texas Corporate Law Changes: What Businesses Need to Know

Texas has positioned itself as a leading business jurisdiction through comprehensive corporate law reforms enacted in 2025. These changes make Texas an increasingly attractive jurisdiction to reincorporate. Understanding these modifications is essential for in-house counsel evaluating Texas as their jurisdiction of choice.

Q: What Is the New Texas Business Judgment Rule Statute?

A: Senate Bill 29, already in effect, codifies the business judgment rule in new Section 21.419 of the Texas Business Organizations Code, creating significant advantages for companies domiciled in the state. This statute creates a legal presumption that directors and officers acted in good faith, on an informed basis, in the corporation’s best interests, and in compliance with law and governing documents.

Key Protections: Directors and officers receive the benefit of presumed good faith in their decision-making processes, with courts required to assume they acted on an informed basis when making corporate decisions. The law further presumes that all board actions were taken in the corporation’s best interests and in full compliance with applicable law and governing documents.

Eligibility Requirements: The statute applies automatically to public corporations with voting shares listed on national securities exchanges, providing immediate benefits for Texas-based companies already trading publicly. Private corporations may access these same protections by including an affirmative election in their governing documents, creating flexibility for businesses.

Litigation Impact: Shareholders face a significantly higher burden when challenging director or officer decisions. Successful litigation requires shareholders to rebut the statutory presumptions and prove that breaches involved fraud, intentional misconduct, ultra vires acts or knowing legal violations.

Q: What Is the Advance Independence Determination Process in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 29 empowers boards of public corporations and private corporations that have opted into the business judgment rule to form committees of independent directors for conflict-of-interest transactions. These committees can petition the Texas Business Court for advance determinations regarding director independence.

Committee Formation Process: Boards of public corporations and opted-in private corporations may form committees composed entirely of independent directors to handle conflict-of-interest transactions. These committees operate with enhanced authority to evaluate transactions involving controlling shareholders, directors or officers, providing a structured approach to potential conflicts.

Court Petition Requirements: These independent director committees may petition the Texas Business Court for advance determinations regarding director independence for specific transactions. The court’s determination becomes dispositive unless new evidence emerges showing a director lacks independence for the particular transaction under review. This creates legal certainty that protects both the corporation and its directors.

Legal Benefits: This mechanism allows corporations to resolve independence questions proactively rather than defending these determinations in subsequent litigation. The advance determination process reduces both legal risk and transaction costs, providing businesses with significant advantages over jurisdictions that lack similar procedures.

Q: What Ownership Thresholds Apply to Derivative Lawsuits in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 29 provides enhanced protection against frivolous shareholder litigation through carefully calibrated ownership requirements. These provisions help prevent nuisance litigation while preserving meaningful oversight rights for shareholders with substantial economic stakes.

Minimum Ownership Requirements: Public corporations and qualifying private corporations domiciled in Texas with 500 or more shareholders may establish minimum ownership requirements for derivative lawsuit eligibility. Corporations may include provisions in their certificate of formation or bylaws requiring shareholders to own up to 3 percent of outstanding shares before filing derivative actions.

Implementation Timeline: Corporations must have these provisions in their governing documents before derivative proceedings are instituted to benefit from the protection. This requirement encourages proactive governance planning and rewards companies that adopt comprehensive protective measures.

Litigation Prevention Benefits: The 3 percent maximum threshold ensures the requirement remains reasonable and accessible while effectively preventing shareholders with minimal economic stakes from pursuing costly litigation. This balance preserves legitimate corporate oversight while reducing the burden of defending against weak or opportunistic claims.

Q: When Can Texas Corporations Limit Books and Records Demands?

A: Senate Bill 29 restricts books and records demands for public corporations and private corporations that have opted into the business judgment rule, providing additional protection for companies. These limitations prevent shareholders from using inspection rights as discovery tools while preserving legitimate oversight purposes.

Denial Grounds: Corporations may deny books and records demands when they reasonably determine the request connects to active or pending derivative proceedings involving the requesting shareholder or expected adversarial civil litigation. This protection prevents shareholders from circumventing normal discovery procedures through inspection rights.

Electronic Communications Exclusions: The legislation clarifies that emails, text messages, electronic communications and social media content are not subject to books and records demands unless the communication effectuates corporate action. This modernizes inspection rights for the digital age while protecting routine corporate communications from fishing expeditions.

Litigation Prevention Strategy: These provisions create a balanced approach that protects corporations from abusive inspection requests while maintaining shareholders’ legitimate oversight rights. Companies benefit from clearer boundaries around books and records access compared to less defined standards in other jurisdictions.

Q: How Does Texas Address Disclosure-Only Settlements?

A: Senate Bill 29 eliminates incentives for disclosure-only settlements that primarily benefit attorneys rather than shareholders. This reform addresses a persistent problem in shareholder litigation across multiple jurisdictions.

Attorney Fee Recovery Changes: The amended law modifies attorney fee recovery provisions in derivative proceedings by specifically stating that additional or amended disclosures to shareholders, regardless of materiality, do not constitute a “substantial benefit” to the corporation. This eliminates the primary incentive for disclosure-only settlements that generate attorney fees without providing meaningful shareholder value.

Litigation Outcome Improvements: The modification encourages substantive litigation outcomes while reducing frivolous lawsuits designed primarily to generate attorney fees through minimal disclosure enhancements. Attorneys must now demonstrate actual corporate benefit beyond mere additional disclosures to recover fees from corporations.

Strategic Advantages: Texas-basedcompanies benefit from reduced settlement pressure in weak derivative claims, as plaintiffs’ attorneys lose the primary economic incentive for filing disclosure-focused litigation. This creates a more predictable litigation environment that favors defendants with strong legal positions.

Q: What Jury Trial and Forum Selection Rights Do Texas Companies Have?

A: Senate Bill 29 codifies forum selection and jury trial waiver rights, providing predictable litigation frameworks for businesses. These provisions give entities greater control over dispute resolution procedures and reduce forum shopping by plaintiffs seeking favorable jurisdictions.

Forum Selection Provisions: Texas entities may include exclusive forum selection clauses in their governing documents for internal entity claims, which include derivative actions and other matters arising from or relating to the entity’s internal affairs. This allows entities to specify Texas courts as exclusive forums for internal entity disputes, providing predictable litigation venues.

Jury Trial Waiver Benefits: The jury trial waiver applies to all internal entity claims, allowing more predictable resolution of complex corporate disputes through bench trials. This is particularly valuable for sophisticated corporate law matters that benefit from judicial expertise rather than jury deliberation.

Strategic Litigation Control: These provisions provide enhanced control over where and how corporate disputes are resolved. The combination of forum selection and jury trial waiver creates a more predictable and efficient litigation environment compared to jurisdictions without similar protections.

Q: What Are the New Class and Series Voting Changes?

A: Senate Bill 29 eliminates mandatory separate class and series voting requirements that previously created barriers for corporations in Texas. This change addresses incompatibilities between rigid voting requirements and complex capital structures common in multi-class corporations.

Voting Structure Flexibility: The amended law allows Texas corporations to design voting structures that better align with their business needs and investor expectations, rather than being constrained by inflexible statutory requirements. This flexibility is particularly valuable for technology companies and other entities with multiple share classes that provide different voting and economic rights to various stakeholder groups.

Multi-Class Corporation Benefits: Previously, rigid voting requirements were often incompatible with sophisticated capital structures that separate economic rights from voting control. The new law accommodates these arrangements while maintaining appropriate shareholder protections through alternative governance mechanisms.

Relocation Advantages: This reform removes a significant barrier that previously deterred complex corporate entities from choosing Texas as their jurisdiction. Companies with sophisticated capital structures can now pursue Texas relocation without being forced to restructure their existing voting arrangements to comply with inflexible statutory requirements.

Q: What Are the Shareholder Proposal Requirements in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 1057, already in effect, allows qualifying Texas corporations to adopt minimum ownership requirements for shareholder proposals, effective September 1, 2025. These requirements ensure that only shareholders with significant economic stakes and broad support can submit proposals, reducing frivolous or disruptive shareholder activism.

Eligibility Requirements: Eligible corporations must have securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act and be listed on national exchanges. They must also either have their principal office in Texas or list on Texas-based exchanges, creating incentives for companies to establish meaningful Texas connections as part of their strategy to reincorporate in the state.

Ownership Thresholds: Corporations that opt into these provisions require shareholders to hold at least $1 million in market value or three percent of outstanding voting shares for six months before and throughout shareholder meetings. In addition, shareholders must solicit holders of at least 67 percent of voting power entitled to vote on the proposal, demonstrating broad shareholder support.

Shareholder Activism Protection: These requirements create meaningful barriers to frivolous proposals while preserving legitimate shareholder oversight rights. The combination of economic stake requirements and broad support thresholds ensures that only well-supported initiatives reach the proxy process, reducing costs and distractions for management and boards.

Q: How Are Proxy Advisory Services Regulated in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 2337, already in effect, imposes disclosure requirements on proxy advisory firms serving Texas public companies, effective September 1, 2025. This legislation provides companies with greater transparency regarding the basis for proxy advisor recommendations and creates enforcement mechanisms for violations.

Covered Entity Requirements: The law applies to companies incorporated in Texas, with principal places of business in Texas, or proposing to redomicile in Texas. This broad coverage ensures that companies benefit from enhanced proxy advisor oversight regardless of their current jurisdiction.

Disclosure Obligations: Proxy advisors must provide detailed disclosures when recommendations are based on nonfinancial factors, including environmental, social, governance (ESG), diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), or sustainability considerations. They must also disclose when advice subordinates shareholder financial interests to other objectives, providing shareholders with clearer information about recommendation methodologies.

Enforcement Mechanisms: Violations constitute deceptive trade practices under Texas law, with enforcement available to companies, shareholders, advisory clients, and the Texas Attorney General. This creates significant compliance obligations for major proxy advisory firms and provides multiple avenues for addressing violations.

Q: What Officer Exculpation Provisions Does Texas Law Offer?

A: Senate Bill 2411, already in effect, extends exculpation protections to officers equivalent to existing director protections. This reform addresses a competitive disadvantage that previously made Texas less attractive for sophisticated corporate entities.

Protection Scope: Texas entities may eliminate or limit officer monetary liability for acts or omissions in their official capacity through certificate of formation amendments. This protection provides officers with liability shields similar to those available to directors under existing law, creating comprehensive protection for corporate leadership.

Exclusions from Protection: Exculpation does not apply to breaches of loyalty duties, bad faith acts involving intentional misconduct or knowing legal violations, transactions providing improper benefits or acts with express statutory liability. These exclusions preserve accountability for the most serious forms of misconduct while protecting officers from liability for good faith business decisions.

Competitive Advantages: This protection enhances Texas’ competitiveness with Delaware and other jurisdictions that offer similar officer protections. Companies can now offer executives liability protection equivalent to what they would receive in other major corporate jurisdictions, removing a potential barrier to relocation.

Q: When Can Boards Amend Certificates of Formation Without Shareholder Approval in Texas?

A: Senate Bill 2411 expands circumstances allowing board amendments to certificates of formation without shareholder approval, reducing administrative burdens for Texas reincorporation and ongoing compliance. These provisions streamline routine corporate maintenance while preserving shareholder approval requirements for substantive changes.

Administrative Amendment Authority: Boards may remove provisions specifying initial directors’ or organizers’ names and addresses, which are required in initial certificates but become obsolete after formation. This eliminates the need for shareholder approval to update routine administrative information that serves no ongoing purpose.

Stock Split Authorization: For single-class corporations without series, boards may effect stock splits or reverse stock splits without shareholder approval if the reverse split’s primary purpose is maintaining national exchange listing eligibility. This provides flexibility for corporations to maintain compliance with exchange requirements without the delay and expense of shareholder meetings.

Operational Benefits: These provisions reduce administrative costs for routine corporate maintenance while preserving meaningful shareholder participation in substantive governance decisions. Companies benefit from more efficient ongoing compliance procedures compared to jurisdictions with more restrictive amendment requirements.

Q: How Does New Texas Corporate Law Affect Merger and Acquisition Processes?

A: Senate Bill 2411 streamlines merger and acquisition processes through several mechanisms that reduce transaction complexity and provide greater certainty for deal participants. These improvements make Texasmore attractive for companies engaged in frequent M&A activity.

Board Approval Flexibility: Boards may approve plans, agreements and documents in “substantially final” form rather than requiring final versions, providing greater negotiation flexibility during transaction processes. This reduces the need for multiple board meetings and allows for more efficient deal management while maintaining appropriate board oversight.

Shareholder Representative Authority: The law expressly authorizes shareholder representatives to act on behalf of shareholders in mergers and interest exchanges, including enforcement and settlement authority. This delegation provides clearer legal authority for post-closing activities and reduces uncertainty about representative powers.

Pre-Formation and Documentation Benefits: Pre-formation equity subscriptions become irrevocable if written, signed and explicitly state irrevocability, providing greater certainty for investors and companies in formation transactions.

Listen below for the full conversation with Michael Lombardi, and tune in to hear the segment live on Monday mornings each game week!","UNC football general manager Michael Lombardi joined 97.9 The Hill’s Aaron Keck this morning for “The Monday Morning Huddle,” presented by Chapel Hill Tire.

The Tar Heels’ struggles continued in their fifth game of the season against Clemson, as the Tigers led 35-3 at halftime on their way to a 38-10 win in Kenan Stadium. UNC enjoyed an off week after that, but it was far from restful: rumors swirled about head coach Bill Belichick being on his way out of Chapel Hill, though the university has insisted Belichick is staying put. Now, UNC turns its attention to a long road trip to Cal this Friday.

Here are a few of Lombardi’s answers on various topics:

On how the team is feeling after a challenging bye week: I think the team is focused on Cal. Last week, there was a lot of noise outside our building, but our building has maintained a semblance of consistency in terms of progress and wanting to improve. And our players have been dedicated. Last week for example, after our practice on Thursday, we had six players for the first time in this program squat over 600 pounds. We had over 30 players have their best personal times in terms of their speed training. So the players are fully invested. One of the things we preach to the team constantly is mental toughness, being able to block out distractions. And what Coach and I have to do with all the noise that’s around the program is block out the distractions and show the players that we have mental toughness.

On an investigative report from WRAL detailing a toxic environment within the program: I don’t know about a WRAL report. I’m not sure there’s been a lot of accuracy coming from that area, but our players are committed to getting better. I think everybody understands it’s a work in progress. Look, we just played one ACC game, we have seven games ahead of us. I don’t think anybody on our team has written off the season or written off anything that we can accomplish. We understand we have to get better and we understand we have to play more competitively in the ACC games, and I think our team wants to do that. I’m not sure there’s the disconnect that that has been reported. No one’s been around our program with any accuracy to really understand that other than the coaches on our staff.

On his message to the fans: The program is about building something that’s sustainable for over a long time. And I think ultimately we’re going to improve and the players are fully engaged. Anything that is successful has taken time. Nick Saban said it the other day: in his first year at Alabama, he struggled and overcame the obstacles. That’s what we want to do. Look, I’m not asking anybody to embrace losing. I wrote that email about not wanting to lose. We want to win here, but we also want to build a program that’s sustainable, doing the right things, fundamentally being the in the right techniques and doing all those things. And we will. Bill has been successful in his career and I think he’ll prove to be successful here in North Carolina.

Why should fans be patient? We haven’t had a recruiting class. We got here late in December and the portal was winding down when we arrived and then we had a spring portal and we really didn’t have a high school recruiting class. Because of that, we took a lot of players in the second recruiting window. So we’re really excited about our recruiting class. We’re gonna have a large class. We’re excited about the players. And what I was really excited about was our players in the building and outside the building that we’ve recruited are all in. You could see it by their example: what they’ve said, what they’ve tweeted, how they feel about our program because they have been inside the walls. They have talked to the coaches and talked to the head coach. Anything worth its weight in gold takes time. You have to be prepared to build something sustainable and I think ultimately that’s what we’re going to do. I don’t know how long it will take, but we’re gonna work diligently to make sure that it happens.

America’s gradual loss of democracy worries me, as our executive branch is seizing the powers of our legislature and courts and using that power to oppress minorities. Millions of people will be harmed or killed by President Trump’s policies.

This is a tragedy we should resist mightily, but his dictatorship will not last forever. Countries have been turned into dictatorships and have eventually freed themselves in the past. And if we show enough courage, we could remake an American democracy, better than before.

I am even more worried by Trump’s attack on the renewable energy industry and his giveaways to the fossil fuel industry. Last year, the fossil fuel industry gave $219 million to help elect Trump and the Republican congressional majority, according to Yale Climate Connections.

Now this industry is getting its payoff. The president is trying to stop the transition to renewable energy at a time when climate change is becoming more dangerous. And we are passing environmental tipping points now, which will cause our climate to worsen even after we switch completely to renewable energy.

If we recover from this environmental assault, it will take thousands of years, and it is likely that more than a quarter of all species of life on Earth will become extinct.

We’re all participating in a race that will determine the fate of our children. On one side is climate change, and the world’s best scientists tell us that this is accelerating faster than anyone expected. On the other side is renewable energy, and this is also growing faster than anyone expected, because renewable energy is much cheaper than fossil fuels.

There will be no decisive winner of this race, as both racers will continue running. One day, the building up of renewable energy may be completed, but our climate will then be far more dangerous than it is today.

Much of the world will become uninhabitable, our Gulf Coast will be too hot, too many wildfires in the Rockies, flooding of our coastlines and too severe storms in certain areas. Many American climate refugees will emigrate to Maine, and how will this affect our already extreme housing shortage?

What is not yet clear is how many people will be able to adjust to the new climate, or whether the Earth will be too damaged for us all. We should be improving our families’ chances of surviving and having good lives by accelerating our efforts to stop climate change, not by halting these efforts.

The steps we take today to reduce climate change will have much more impact than the steps we could take years from now. All of this is to say that the president is endangering and harming our families’ lives when he does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, protecting them from their competition, renewable energy.

As time goes by, it will become clearer and clearer that we are quietly watching a terrible crime against humanity and all life on Earth.

We must ask Sens. King and Collins and our House representatives to push harder to protect the climate legislation that was starting to safeguard our children. How did we learn to sit on our hands while someone harms our children’s lives just to make more money?

“This could enable us to identify ADRD early and also identify risk factors that could be treated at an earlier stage.
Personal risk factors are often embedded within the free text of clinical notes or discharge summaries that are not easily searchable, computable or standardized.
Boland hopes the research identifies existing ADRD risk factors and uncovers new risk factors.
She has long been fascinated by hidden differences among individuals that can alter disease risk—sometimes termed latent disease—including hidden genetic or environmental differences.","LATROBE, PA — Saint Vincent College recently received a $150,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant with Dr. Mary Regina Boland, C’10, assistant professor of data science, as principal investigator. This funding is part of a $1 million grant with three other institutions: University of Pennsylvania, University of Iowa and University of Virginia.

The project is titled “Personal Determinants of Health-Enhanced Machine Learning Models for Early Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.” Fruits of this project will advance national health and promote science and technology development by providing algorithms, software and systems that can train machine learning models on electronic health records for accurate and early prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).

ADRD are debilitating conditions that affect over 5 million people over the age of 65, characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive impairment and personality changes, which can further evolve to dementia and death.

The population of the United States is aging, as evidenced by the “Vintage 2024 Population Estimates” released in June by the US Census Bureau. The findings reported that older adults outnumber children in 11 states and nearly half of US counties.

Simultaneously, the number of US citizens suffering from ADRD is growing. Boland warns that unless research provides solutions for early identification and treatment of ADRD, the burden on the nation’s healthcare system will be unparalleled.

“The purpose of this project is to learn patterns from those who have or had ADRD in the past to understand those who may be developing ADRD,” she said. “This could enable us to identify ADRD early and also identify risk factors that could be treated at an earlier stage. With earlier treatment, we are hoping the effects of this devastating disease will be ameliorated.”

Recent studies have shown that personal risk factors such as education, employment and lifestyle or family history significantly influence ADRD onset and progression.

These factors, however, are not recorded in a structured format within existing electronic health records. Personal risk factors are often embedded within the free text of clinical notes or discharge summaries that are not easily searchable, computable or standardized. This creates a major technical barrier for their integration into ADRD prediction models.

The research project aims to develop a computational platform using novel machine learning and natural language processing methods to automatically extract personal risk factors from clinical narratives within electronic health records and leverage them for accurate and early prediction of ADRD. Boland hopes the research identifies existing ADRD risk factors and uncovers new risk factors.

“By learning new risk factors and understanding the patterns of these risk factors, we hope to both identify ADRD earlier in the disease and also identify potential avenues for treatment and other therapies,” she said.

Certain individuals develop ADRD at a younger age, Boland added, and/or also progress more rapidly than others once they are diagnosed. The reasons are unclear but can be due to different factors, including exposure to various toxins. Patients with a greater lifetime exposure to a toxin will suffer greater effects from that toxin, therefore any toxins implicated in ADRD will more affect those with a longer exposure.

“Because toxin exposures vary by where we live and work, this effect can result in differential exposures among individuals,” Boland said. “This results in diversity among the ADRD phenotype observed among various populations.”

The work will continue for several years with an estimated end date of Sept. 30, 2029.

Boland has been studying population-level differences in disease risk and exposure risk for over a decade and has investigated specific environmental exposures and less specific ones, such as seasonal variability. She has long been fascinated by hidden differences among individuals that can alter disease risk—sometimes termed latent disease—including hidden genetic or environmental differences.

Boland’s interest in the environmental causes of diseases stems from growing up near an area that was deemed a superfund site by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Thousands of contaminated sites—or superfund sites—exist in the country due to hazardous waste being dumped, left out in the open or otherwise improperly managed. These sites include manufacturing facilities, processing plants, landfills and mining sites, according to the EPA.

“I witnessed several individuals who I grew up with die at a very early age,” Boland said, “and in many cases, it was difficult to identify the cause until much later.”

Looking ahead, Boland hopes to engage students with this research project to help them learn skills with real-world datasets to health analytics and ADRD.

“We need to train the future generation of scientists, researchers and analysts to be able to study and conduct ethical research,” Boland said. “I have had the pleasure of interacting with several students who have helped with literature review, and I am hoping to include them in modeling in the future.”

This is Boland’s second NSF grant as principal investigator while at Saint Vincent College. The first, also in association with three other institutions of higher education, and for the award period 2024-2027, is titled “Strengthening Collaborative Advancements Leveraging Equitable University Partnerships.” Fellow principal investigators for this grant are Fr. Michael Antonacci, O.S.B., C’07, S’14, associate professor of physics, and Dr. Stephen Jodis, dean of the Herbert W. Boyer School of Natural Science, Mathematics and Computing.

Boland also published a textbook with Springer Nature in January titled “Health Analytics with R: Learning Data Science Using Examples from Healthcare and Direct-to-Consumer Genetics.” Since its release, the textbook has sold over 5,000 copies both online and in print.",https://www.stvincent.edu/news/2025/10/files/news-thumbnail-national-science-foundation-grant.webp,N,,2025-10-13 19:01:57.022723

Because power plants last forty years or more, due to inflation, a new plant always costs lots more than the unit it’s replacing.
Unlike coal or gas-fired power plants, renewables only “consume” free stuff like wind or sunlight.
More fossil-fired power plants are just fine with them so long as the bulk electricity is affordable and available.
Whether this will lead to a vast increase in new fossil-fired power plant development remains to be seen.","One of the biggest mistakes we made about electrification is that we assumed that the new technologies embracing electricity, like electric vehicles for example, would embrace decarbonization at the same time. We were wrong. In fact, in the US today, exactly the opposite has occurred. The paradox of electrification without decarbonization is simple. Take, for example, two convenient symbols of electrification, an electric car and a heat pump. Both displace fossil fuel usage, but both technologies also rely on electricity. We, and others, assumed that the large base load fossil-fired power generating stations favored by utilities would, due to growing public pressure, eventually be replaced by something more environmentally benign, like small modular reactors or extensive solar plus batteries. Instead, policymakers have decided to ignore environmental concerns and embrace more base load fossil fuel usage. In practical terms, this means permission to build new natural gas-fired power plants, while coal-fired power stations will be permitted or even encouraged to remain open.

Because power plants last forty years or more, due to inflation, a new plant always costs lots more than the unit it’s replacing. One of the frequent criticisms of renewable energy technologies like offshore wind or solar plus batteries is that they are very expensive. This is certainly true compared to the fully depreciated facility they are replacing. The simple fact is that all new power-generating facilities, regardless of technology, are far more costly than the units they replace. These are called capital expenses because the assets financed are expected to be in service for decades. But renewables have one outstanding advantage over fossil-fueled power generation. They have almost no big operating expenses like fuel. Unlike coal or gas-fired power plants, renewables only “consume” free stuff like wind or sunlight. Over a thirty or forty year lifetime operating period, the expense differentials are enormous. But in our intensely ideological times, these differences are often overlooked for partisan political purposes. And yes, we know they’re intermittent.

This idea of electrification without decarbonization has been adopted by technology executives such as Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt. Speaking at an AI conference last October, he pointed out that for him, and presumably other executives, attaining environmental goals like decarbonization is much less important than a vastly expanded network of data centers. His basic point was, ""Forget about your climate targets, you won’t achieve them anyway.” Also he suggested that perhaps all these new data centers would actually solve the climate crisis. But as a former CEO, he also seemed to be asserting one very old corporate prerogative: the unlimited right of a corporation to pollute without interference from the government. As an aside, what’s so interesting to us is that no serious political figure has given such full-throated support for this view, probably since the McKinley era. But here we are.

People like Mr Schmidt and his former employer, Google, are among those leading the charge for much more rapid growth in domestic power generation resources, and they’ve stated quite plainly that they couldn’t care less about CO2 emissions and their adverse environmental implications. More fossil-fired power plants are just fine with them so long as the bulk electricity is affordable and available. Their “only” requirement is for an enormous increment to the existing generating fleet at a cost of at least several hundred billion dollars. These investments will either be “inside the fence” and paid for by the data centers themselves or they will be borne by local utilities with the large incremental expense passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.

The question for us as analysts is to ask whether this view has become mainstream among senior policymakers in Washington and, if so, what are the implications? What would a pollution-indifferent buildout of the US power grid look like? In two words, more gas. There have been no new coal-fired power-generating plants built in the US in decades because their economics were undercut by domestically sourced natural gas. So a pollution-tolerant administration in Washington, for example, does not reverse the unattractive power plant economics of new coal. But the interesting thing for us is that even with a utility-friendly administration in Washington, the prospects for future gas-fired plants haven’t deviated much from long term historical trends. The US EIA expects about 18.7 gigawatts of new gas fired capacity to be added between now and 2028, with 2028 showing a big uplift relative to prior years. But the EIA’s historical data also show us what a big commitment to new gas-fired power generation truly looks like. In the five year period, 2000 to 2005, the US added over 160 gigawatts of new gas-fired power generation, with almost 50 gigawatts of new generation added in the year 2000 alone. The EIA data shows the US expecting to add about 11 gigawatts in 2028, a supposed breakout year. Like the man said, those are rookie numbers.

All we can conclude at this point is that policymakers in Washington have created an administrative permission structure for more pollution from fossil-fired power-generating stations. Whether this will lead to a vast increase in new fossil-fired power plant development remains to be seen. Despite what we and many others expected, the present goal seems to be more electrification, especially for AI, and without decarbonization.

Automakers and suppliers “have underestimated the need for battery testing,” Thomas Parker, automotive sales manager for Inficon, said at an interview last week in Detroit, where he was attending the Battery Show.

Moisture and electric power don’t mix. Hybrids combine traditional internal combustion engines with electric power. Electric vehicles rely on all electric power.

“It all goes back to what happens when something goes wrong,” the Inficon executive said.

Inficon’s inspection operations have customers across various other industries, including medical devices and electric-storage systems.

“We’re being pulled into other things,” Parker said. “I had a pacemaker company in my booth (at the Battery Show) this morning.

“All of our customers want to be sure of their measurements,” he added. “They want to be more certain of what they’re doing.”

Thousands more Missourians will likely be cut off from their power in October, as records from previous years show that's when Ameren cuts off the most people. For example, the utility cut 20,083 customers off from power in October of 2022, compared with the 9,366 and 2,475 it cut off that September and August, respectively.

Missouri electricity bills expected to keep increasing due to data centers

A study commissioned by the Consumers Council of Missouri found that electricity and gas rates in Missouri are already rising faster than both national inflation and the state's job wage growth. Ameren hiked its electricity rates by nearly 12% for the average customer this year, and prices are expected to continue rising due to the rapid expansion of data centers throughout the state.

Developers of a controversial data center in St. Louis' historic Armory building have repeatedly said their project won't cause ""unjust"" or ""unreasonable"" electricity bill increases to Missouri residents. The same claim was made by the developers of the now-defunct 440-acre hyperscale data center in St. Charles. Consumer advocates and utility experts disagree, saying ""unjust"" and ""unreasonable"" costs are open to interpretation.

The developers are referencing terms in Missouri's recently passed SB 4, which changed numerous rules related to the state's utilities, including that utilities couldn't unjustly or unreasonably raise customers' prices because of large power users like data centers. The law, however, does not define what ""unjust"" and ""unreasonable"" mean, leaving the ultimate decision up to the state's utility regulators, which have taken a hard pro-utility position in recent years.

""The question is how much should other ratepayers be shielded from the impact of these data centers and how much demand they put on the system,"" Consumers Council of Missouri attorney John Coffman told 5 On Your Side.

""There's a hot debate going on between the utility companies with the data centers and the other parties that represent the residential customers, small businesses, other industrial customers, and all the other customer groups who don't believe that what the utilities are proposing is good enough to protect customers from paying high costs,"" Consumers Council of Missouri attorney John Coffman told 5 On Your Side. ""Our greatest fear is that Ameren Missouri will have to build another power plant, for data centers, and then those data centers either become obsolete or go out of business, leaving the rest of us to pay for that power plant.""

SB 4 also allows utility companies to charge residents for under-construction power plants, before they're even up and running. The state's ongoing push to build expensive and financially risky nuclear power plants to meet data center demand would drive up costs for residents, especially if the projected demand for data centers never shows up.",https://media.ksdk.com/assets/KSDK/images/e51eb8cb-a81d-4652-a832-df9b340ea987/20251013T160935/e51eb8cb-a81d-4652-a832-df9b340ea987_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 16:01:42.120333

When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.”

— Michael Avanesian

LOS ANGELES, CA, UNITED STATES, October 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Federal safety regulators launched an investigation into Tesla's electronic door systems following a November 2024 crash that claimed three college students' lives after they became trapped inside a Cybertruck in Piedmont, California. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) probe encompasses 174,000 Tesla Model Y vehicles amid mounting evidence of electronic door system failures.

California Personal Injury attorney Michael Avanesian of Avian Law Group states that Tesla's electronic door systems present safety concerns that prioritize technological innovation over emergency egress principles. Recent wrongful death lawsuits filed by families of 19-year-old Krysta Tsukahara (Tsukahara v. Dixon, Alameda County Superior Court) and 20-year-old Jack Nelson (Nelson v. Tesla Inc., Case No. 25CV120058, Alameda County Superior Court) allege Tesla's door design prevented their escape from the burning vehicle.

""This case demonstrates the intersection of advanced technology and fundamental safety requirements,"" said Avanesian. ""When vehicle design compromises emergency exit capability, we must examine whether innovation is adequately balanced with occupant protection.""

Federal Investigation Reveals Pattern of System Failures

NHTSA data documents more than 140 consumer complaints regarding Tesla door malfunctions across various models since 2018. The September 2025 investigation (NHTSA Investigation No. PE25-016) targets electronic door handle failures affecting Model Y vehicles, with documented cases of occupants unable to exit vehicles during emergencies.

The Cybertruck operates exclusively through electronic controls that fail when vehicles lose power during crashes. While manual releases exist, they are positioned beneath rubber mats and may be difficult to locate during emergencies, particularly for rear-seat passengers.

Tesla's design chief Franz von Holzhausen acknowledged the need for ""more intuitive door mechanisms during emergency situations"" in September 2025. The company announced plans to redesign door handles, combining electronic and manual releases.

Rising Product Liability in Electric Vehicle Sector

Tesla door defect cases emerge within escalating product liability litigation. Electric vehicle defects present unique litigation challenges. While EVs demonstrate superior fire safety statistics – 0.00044% fire rate compared to 0.1% for internal combustion vehicles – their complex electronic systems create failure modes that can impact occupant egress during emergencies.

""We are observing a shift in automotive liability as manufacturers implement sophisticated electronic systems,"" Avanesian explained. ""The legal system must address emerging risks associated with electronic vehicle technologies that may impact consumer safety.""

Regulatory Framework and International Standards

Current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were established before widespread electronic door system adoption and do not comprehensively address emergency egress requirements. The recently established FMVSS No. 305a focuses primarily on battery safety without comprehensive emergency escape provisions.

China has implemented stricter door handle safety requirements, mandating every door feature external mechanical handles and clearly marked internal releases positioned within 300mm of door edges. European regulators are considering restrictions on fully concealed door handles following safety concerns.

Legal Proceedings and Industry Impact

Avanesian predicts Tesla door defect cases will establish precedents for electric vehicle product liability. ""These lawsuits will determine standards for balancing design innovation with fundamental safety requirements,"" he said. ""The outcome will influence industry practices and consumer protection standards for the electric vehicle sector.""

The wrongful death lawsuits seek unspecified damages and are scheduled for trial in February 2027. Legal experts anticipate additional cases as awareness of door system failures increases among vehicle owners.

As federal investigators examine Tesla's door systems, the electric vehicle industry faces evaluation of safety standards that will determine how innovation integrates with consumer protection requirements.

Joe Lombardo (R) raised concern about economic impacts to growing industries such as data centers and mining if solar energy projects are curtailed or delayed.","Threats from the Trump administration to curtail already awarded federal funds and approvals for U.S. clean energy development have revved up in recent days—with the U.S. Interior Dept. reversing its sign-off to proceed on the 6.2-GW Esmerelda Seven solar and battery project in Nevada, while the U.S. Dept. of Energy targets hundreds of previously awarded clean energy grants worth an estimated $24 billion.

The U.S. Interior Dept. said Oct. 10 that it has cancelled a key approval for the Esmeralda Seven solar and battery project, to be located about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nev., on public land, in an agreement with firms developing its seven contiguous sections. Together, they are set to produce 6.2 GW of clean power and be a leading energy supplier in the state. The ""programmatic review"" action, quietly taken and noted in an agency website statement, followed the Trump order to freeze clean energy project permits. Interior released the Esmeralda project draft environmental review early this year and had promised final approval, the record of decision, in July. Among key project developers are NextEra Energy, Invenergy, Leeward Energy and ConnectGen.

Interior did not cancel the entire 62,000-acre project, a department spokesperson told media, but directed developers to resubmit parcels for new approval separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” if they choose to continue development.

Among developers responding to media, a NextEra Energy spokesperson said on Oct. 10 the firm was “in the early stage of development and remains committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with [the department.] A spokesperson for Leeward Energy said it had “no information to share regarding the project update.”

Among other administration rule changes mandated in July, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has to personally approve all “environmentally damaging” solar and wind energy projects on public lands, requiring the department to consider “capacity density” when evaluating projects, which observers said could be a barrier due to their space needs.

At the same time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was ending a $7 billion national program that offered states grants to develop solar energy for low-income households. In September, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture said it would no longer fund solar projects on productive farmland, a policy change from the Biden administration.

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) raised concern about economic impacts to growing industries such as data centers and mining if solar energy projects are curtailed or delayed. Nevada ranked fourth in the U.S. last year in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources, comprising 31% of the state's total power generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the Interior Dept. needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”

Despite Esmeralda's clean energy appeal, some environmental advocates opposed it for its impacts to a pristine area. Advocacy group Basin and Range Watch and others sued Interior in May for not considering Esmeralda Seven in its environmental review of Greenlink West, a 472-mile, multibillion-dollar transmission line from the Reno area to Las Vegas to move energy from rural areas to Nevada urban centers. A spokeswoman for owner NV Energy said the utility is moving ahead to build the project.

Opponents speculated whether Esmeralda Seven's developers would actually resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration"" add new layers of complication, said one. Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said the cancelled review “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”

DOE Eyes Billions More in Funding Cuts

The Esmeralda reversal comes as a list developed by the U.S. Energy Dept. of hundreds of clean power project federal grant recipients that are targeted for termination became public through media pickup—possibly totaling an added $12 billion beyond $7.56 billion the agency announced earlier this month would terminate.

The group includes some 600 grant recipient names, with about half on the already announced list and total funding of nearly $24 billion according to the document. Media speculate the list was leaked, with possible intent to use the cuts as leverage.

Initiatives affected include carbon capture projects in development by ExxonMobil and Occidental as well as hundreds of millions in funding provided to electric vehicle manufacturing sites built or under construction by vehicle makers Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Stellantis and Volvo.

Canada, however, appears to be is moving to capture more carbon capture market share the U.S. may leave behind. Montreal-based technology startup Deep Sky said on Oct. 9 that it will build what it said would be one of the world’s largest direct air capture projects, an estimated $500-million plant in Manitoba. Set to start construction next year, the facility would be able to remove 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere, Deep Sky said. No contractor selection was announced. ""Canada has the opportunity to become the carbon removal capital of the world, and capture the jobs and economic opportunity that will come with it,” said Alex Petre, Deep Sky CEO.

Also on the Trump agenda now are new funding cuts that could total more than $4.5 billion, to five U.S. hydrogen hubs, including those focused on deriving the fuel from natural gas, Those are: the HyVelocity hub located on the Gulf Coast; the Midwest and mid-Atlantic hubs; the Appalachian hub known as ARCH 2 in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania; and the Heartland hub in the Dakotas, Montana, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Burgum had supported the latter while he was North Dakota governor, while Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) previously voiced concern about potential Trump cuts to the Appalachian hub's $925 million in federal funding.

DOE officials have not officially confirmed specific cuts. ""We have been unable to verify the documents referenced. No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,"" DOE chief spokesperson Ben Dietderich told ENR. The agency ""continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/10/12/BLM.ESMERALDA.-SOLARSITE.jpeg?height=635&t=1760378105&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 15:01:52.091742

The Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act from Democratic Reps. Nanette Barragán of California, Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon and Chellie Pingree of Maine calls for $1 billion in investments in ocean-powered energy technologies, doled out by the Department of Energy.

Under the legislation, the DOE secretary would establish a Marine Energy Acceleration Fund to pay for new projects, research and workforce development. The fund would also seek to accelerate wave and tidal energy technologies aimed at creating clean energy and strengthening the economies of coastal areas.

“Marine energy is an essential part of America’s clean energy future,” Barragán said in a statement. “With its potential to generate reliable, zero-emission power, it can help us transition from fossil fuels and deliver clean energy directly to our communities. By investing in marine energy technologies today, we can bring wave-powered electricity onto our grid, create good jobs, and strengthen our energy independence. Now more than ever, we must accelerate clean energy innovation to cut emissions and lower costs for American families.”

The $1 billion in funding would be spread across at least 20 marine energy demonstration projects, per the bill text. Those projects would export power to microgrids, community grids or utility-scale grids.

The National Marine Energy Centers would likely be looped into the funding push, serving as consultants to the DOE secretary and providing education and training for jobs in the field. The Energy Department, meanwhile, would be charged with mapping areas that have the best potential to tap marine energy.

National laboratories and other federal agencies could also play a role in these elements of the legislation. The bill specifically calls out the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to help DOE in assessing the economic potential of at least 50 sites identified by modeling to “have significant marine energy potential.”

The DOE secretary should prioritize R&D projects that lower costs and increase efficiency through the rapid design and testing of new marine energy systems, components and controls. Preference should also be given to technologies that monitor and lessen climate-related impacts to coastal communities.

One element of the bill that appears to have common ground with the Trump administration’s energy policy is on permitting: The bill calls for an elimination of “red tape” and a more streamlined approval process for projects.

A press release announcing the bill pointed to “momentum” on marine energy technologies occurring in Barragán’s district, including a pilot wave energy project at the Port of Los Angeles.

“This project shows how investments in marine energy can turn innovative technology into real clean power solutions that create jobs and strengthen local communities,” the release noted.",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/GettyImages-2184370910.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 15:01:42.357379

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power.
“Meaning you don’t have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.
Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.
“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).","A recent report estimates that New Mexico has the potential to produce substantial power from its geothermal resources.

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?

Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.

This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.

This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.

Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.

“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.

He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.

That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.

Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.

Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.

“The really exciting possibility is what’s called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.

Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.

“Meaning you don’t have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.

Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.

Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.

Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.

In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.

There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.

The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.

By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.

Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.

“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).

Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.

“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”

New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.

In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.

Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.

“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we’re hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.

Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.

At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.

“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We’ve got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”

A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.

“I think it’s a hell of an idea, but it’s a ways out,” Woods said.

Woods is clear: he doesn’t want to replace oil and gas anytime soon. For now it keeps crucial dollars flowing to his constituents in the far northeastern stretch of the state.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lordsburg-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 20:02:13.791315

Try as he might, US President Donald Trump can’t stop the domestic solar industry in its tracks. Even as some high profile projects face cancellation or delay, other signs of momentum keeps surfacing. One good example consists of the nation’s water system owners and managers, who see floating solar technology as an effective means of reducing their energy costs, improving resiliency, and conserving water, too.

One Small Floating Solar Project To Rule Them All

The private research institute Nova Southeastern University is among the latest energy consumers to dip a toe in the floating solar waters. Last month, NSU announced that it is the first university in the US to bring a commercial-level floating solar system into its energy portfolio. Construction is currently underway and the system should be up and running before year’s end.

At 700 kilowatts in capacity and only two acres in size, the system is tiny compared to today’s megascale solar farms. However, it will get the job done. The new array will hook up directly to the school’s newest student housing complex, Mako Hall, where it is expected to fill a significant proportion of electricity demand.

The new NSU system demonstrates the maturing state of the floating solar supply chain, too. Floating solar is a new industry that requires specialized racks and mooring systems. As demand rises, economies of scale kick in, helping to reduce costs. The global firm Ciel & Terre supplied its Hydrelio platform for the installation, consisting of 1,200 solar panels anchored for hurricane hardiness.

Ease of installation is another feature typical of floating solar systems. They don’t require land to be cleared and leveled, which explains why NSU expects the clean kilowatts to begin flowing only 90 days or so after the start of construction (see more floating solar background here).

The system’s developer, D3Energy, also anticipates that it will be a model for other institutions that are squeezed for space. As a crowded urban campus, NSU doesn’t have much ground space, but it does include several ponds within its borders.

“This installation at NSU demonstrates how floating solar can deliver real benefits for institutions that may not have the land or rooftop space for large-scale solar,” emphasized D3’s Managing Director, Stetson Tchividjian, in a press statement.

Small Floating Solar System, Big Savings

Replacing fossil fuels in an institutional residence is just one use case with the potential for widespread adoption. Another key market consists of water treatment plants, where floating arrays can also offset a significant amount of electricity consumption. D3Energy is also active in that space.

Back in 2023 CleanTechnica caught wind of activity under way at the Signal Hill Water Treatment Plant in Utah. What makes the project particularly interesting is the water district’s choice of the leading global energy services firm Ameresco to oversee the new solar system.

“Ameresco has been working on an energy makeover for the US Department of Defense, including a new floating solar project at Fort Bragg in North Carolina,” CleanTechnica observed, taking note of potential opportunities for replication of the Signal Hill array in other Ameresco projects.

Ameresco tapped D3Energy for the solar installation, with the expectation that the system would be up and running in about 12 months. The project was completed ahead of schedule and construction was officially completed in September of 2024.

As with the NSU project, Signal Hill’s new 587.5 kilowatt array is relatively small, but it will reduce the facility’s grid energy consumption by 92% while reducing annual energy costs by 80%.

“The notion that solar panels must be installed on land is an unnecessary limitation. By reconsidering their placement, we unlock new opportunities for sustainability,” explained Ameresco EVP Lou Maltezos in a press statement marking the end of construction.

“This first-ever floating solar array in Utah is both innovative and economically feasible, making it a prime example of sustainable development,” Maltezos added.

More Solar Energy For Texas

Of course, no story about the US floating solar industry is complete without a mention of Texas, where everything is bigger, including the state’s renewable energy profile. Texas has been a perennial leader in installed wind capacity among the 50 states since the early 2000’s, and of late it has been vying with California and Florida for the #2 slot in solar.

In the latest development, last summer the leading US infrastructure and energy services firm Diamond Infrastructure Solutions tapped the Texas company Third Pillar Solar to install floating solar systems on its portfolio of reservoirs in Texas.

As described by Third Pillar, the first-of-its-kind collaboration represents the largest collection of floating solar projects in all three Americas. The number of projects will depend Third Pillar’s site assessments, but the company already anticipates that the agreement will launch up to 500 megawatts’ worth of solar capacity. The new systems will provide Diamond and its clients with the extra benefit of conserving water — and money — that would otherwise be lost to evaporation.

“The comprehensive floating solar initiative represents a potential investment exceeding $700 million and is expected to generate up to 500MW of clean energy — all while minimizing land development and helping conserve approximately 15% of freshwater currently lost to evaporation in a fast-growing, water-stressed region,” Third Pillar notes.

Third Pillar CEO Jaimeet Gulati also chipped in his two cents in a press statement, drawing attention to the multiple benefits of floating solar arrays. “This agreement demonstrates the growing appetite for utility-scale energy solutions and highlights how floating solar can enhance and transform the value of existing infrastructure, all while providing cost-competitive energy, preserving agricultural land, reducing evaporation losses, and existing out of public view,” Gulati said.

Once again illustrating the rapid timeline for floating solar projects, Third Pillar plans to have all of the projects in service before 2030 rolls around.

Regardless of the current state of federal energy policy, Third Pillar is loaded for bear. The company is focusing its floating solar business on the nation’s vast array of wastewater lagoons and reclaimed sand and gravel pits, alongside industrial reservoirs. With the financial backing of majority owner Glentra Capital, Third Pillar already claims more than 5 gigawatts in its portfolio, with another 60 deployments coming through its 11-state project pipeline.

More Green Jobs For A Job-Thirsty Nation

Speaking of federal energy policy, it’s a mystery why US President Donald Trump has chosen, out of all the abundant energy options spread across the land, to tamp down access to the nation’s most abundant, accessible, and inexpensive resource, namely, wind and solar energy.

After all the President’s “American Energy Dominance” plan explicitly calls upon federal resources to support other renewables, including biomass, hydropower, and geothermal. The Energy Department is also continuing to fund the development of marine energy harvesting devices, even though the domestic marine industry — wave, currents, and tides — is years away from achieving commercial uptake to any significant degree.

The $4-billion project, still in early planning, would link the Yukon’s isolated energy system to the Western continental grid at Bob Quinn Lake, B.C.

If built, the Yukon-B.C. grid connect could generate up to $7.6 billion annually in long-term economic benefits, support 36,000 jobs over 50 years and help replace nearly five million litres of diesel fuel each year in six northern communities, according to the report.

The Yukon currently operates on a stand-alone power system, relying mostly on hydroelectricity, diesel generators and liquefied natural gas. The proposed 765-kilometre transmission line would be the territory’s first connection to the broader North American grid, improving energy reliability.

The project took a step forward on May 23, when former Yukon premier Ranj Pillai and B.C. premier David Eby signed a memorandum of understanding to guide early-stage planning.

According to YDC’s report released Oct. 1, the transmission line could unlock 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy potential, enough to generate $2 billion in annual clean electricity revenue. It could also support electrification of homes and vehicles, helping stabilize electricity supply and make clean energy more accessible in remote communities.

Mineral-rich regions in the Yukon and B.C. could unlock an estimated $181.2 billion in growth to the mining sector, especially for deposits considered critical to Canada’s technology, defence and clean energy sectors. The report estimates the project could displace up to nine million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually, roughly 1.3 per cent of Canada’s total emissions.

Increased energy capacity in the Yukon could attract major investment in the mining sector and reduce reliance on diesel, the report says.

The transmission line would cross First Nations lands and YDC says reconciliation is a guiding principle in its planning. The report highlights opportunities for Indigenous ownership and leadership in energy development, describing the project as a “nation-building” initiative.

YDC has begun energy planning discussions with Yukon First Nations, aiming to move the Yukon-B.C. grid connect project forward together. A connected grid could reduce investment risk and support Indigenous-led renewable energy projects.

Beyond energy, the Yukon-B.C. grid connect project could pave investment in roads, telecommunications and industrial facilities. The report cites $200 million in upgrades to transportation networks across northern B.C. and the Yukon as a potential benefit.

Reliable electricity is also a key part of Canada’s northern defence strategy. The report cites the Assembly of First Nations and defence experts as supporting energy infrastructure upgrades to bolster Arctic sovereignty and critical minerals development.

The project remains in the pre-feasibility stage, backed by $40 million from Canada’s Critical Mineral Infrastructure Fund and $13 million from the YDC Fund.

No final route has been selected, but two options are under review, one connecting Bob Quinn Lake to Ross River via the Robert Campbell Highway and another linking Bob Quinn Lake to Whitehorse via the Alaska Highway.

The company, PSEG Renewable Transmission, is opposing a procedural schedule issued by the Maryland Public Service Commission, which plans to review the project until at least February 2027.

PSEG argues that the commission’s schedule will make it impossible to reach a deadline for placing the power line in service by June 2027, which was set by the operator of the region’s electric grid, PJM Interconnection.

“PJM set the in-service date to prevent specific impending reliability violations,” wrote PSEG attorney J. Joseph Curran, III, in a letter to the commission. “Unless these violations are addressed, PJM has determined that overall system reliability in the PJM region — including in Maryland — could be compromised, and the PJM region could be exposed to widespread and extreme conditions, such as system collapse and blackouts.”

The commission, by contrast, has expressed confidence that the electric grid will remain well-managed while it deliberates about the transmission line.

US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

In his letter to the commission, Curran also requested that it establish a target date to issue a final order on the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the power line project is known. An end date would help the company more efficiently coordinate with other state and federal permitting agencies, plan construction activities, and negotiate with landowners, he wrote.

But in a statement Friday, Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the commission, said it is “unlikely” to place an end cap on the proceedings by setting a target date for a final order. The commission’s schedule ends in February 2027 with a deadline for the parties to submit their final briefs.

The commission will ultimately decide whether the controversial power line receives a “Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity,” authorizing its construction. But the process has already been mired in delays, largely because of intense pushback from landowners in the line’s path, and other community members and elected officials in the impacted jurisdictions.

Because of landowner denials, PSEG had to go to court to get a federal district judge to order temporary access to hundreds of properties for environmental surveys, which it will need in order to get a final ruling from the commission.

Those surveys are well underway, though landowners have appealed. On Thursday, the company filed suit against a third round of defiant landowners, requesting access to 64 additional parcels.

By comparison, in his Oct. 7 letter, Curran said the company has obtained voluntary access agreements for 52 parcels along the proposed route.

The proposed line would stretch 67 miles through largely rural areas in Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, connecting a power substation near the Pennsylvania line with a substation in Frederick County.

The project was commissioned by grid operator PJM alongside a host of other projects meant to relieve problems in a strained grid, caused in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers and expected retirements of fossil fuel generating stations.

In a statement shortly after the Maryland Commission issued its schedule for the Piedmont line, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields said that “PJM has identified extensive, severe, and widespread reliability violations that PJM expects to occur as soon as June 2027 if these projects are not built on the prescribed schedule, leaving the entire system more exposed to reliability risks, including power outages.”

Shields noted that Maryland will be “additionally challenged to meet local demand from local sources” given the planned retirements of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants, which are currently operating solely because of “must run” agreements with the grid.

In its news release announcing the scheduling order on Sept. 11, the commission highlighted that PSEG submitted its application for the certification in late December 2024, as opposed to fall 2024 as planned.

In his letter to the commission, Curran pushed back, arguing that the New-Jersey based power company only submitted in December because it decided to conduct additional public hearings in November 2024.

In requesting an end date for the proceedings, Curran argued that it would help expedite the permits that PSEG would likely only be able to obtain after a decision on the certificate of public convenience, including from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the impacted counties.

“Having a final order date in the procedural schedule is necessary so that the Company can have plans in place to ensure the Project goes into service as soon as practical to meet critical reliability needs,” Curran wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DSC_0282-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-10-13 14:01:43.341186

The Rise of Data Centers and Electricity Demands on Virginia, Ohio, and North Carolina

By Jason E. Wandling

Data centers have generated unprecedented controversy across the country over the past two years, but have attracted the most attention in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio. Each of those states is currently experiencing a strong surge in electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centers, which has caused consternation among existing power utility customers and their new neighbors. This piece examines the experiences of data centers in each of those states.

In Virginia, Dominion Energy projects about a 5 percent annual increase in peak power demand over the next 15 years, a fact which runs up hard against constraints established by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which requires Dominion to be carbon-free by 2045 and sets limits on building new fossil-fuel plants unless certain efficiency thresholds are met. Pursuant to the VCEA, utilities must also show that any fossil-fuel-based solution is more cost-effective than clean alternatives.

Dominion Energy’s proposal to construct a new, 944 MW natural gas “peaker” plant in Chesterfield County to meet demand has brought this issue to the forefront. Peaker plants are designed to run only during high-demand periods, and Dominion argues this plant is the best and necessary solution to avoid reliability issues.

Clean energy advocates and other stakeholders argue Dominion did not adequately consider cleaner alternatives such as battery storage, grid-enhancing technologies, virtual power plants, or demand flexibility and have challenged Dominion’s modeling, cost comparisons, and assumptions. These critics contend that the analyses are biased toward the outcome of building the gas plant.

Likewise, the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s (SCC) staff has raised doubts about whether the Chesterfield plant is indeed the best or only viable path forward. They noted that Dominion’s economic impact study didn’t show large benefits, pointed out gaps in reliability studies, and criticized Dominion for not having developed cleaner dispatchable options earlier. Ultimately, however, staff did not formally oppose the plant, suggesting that with existing demand growth, regulators may see few alternatives. Public comments and hearings are ongoing.

Tension is increasing between the need to meet reliability goals while achieving the VCEA’s decarbonization requirements. Moreover, ratepayers such as residential consumers and existing businesses and industry may end up bearing the costs of constructing electrical grid infrastructure necessary to support the continued growth of data centers in Virginia.

Those tensions have begun to express themselves in the run-up to the November 2025 Virginia elections because voters are increasingly concerned about rising electricity bills and the strain on the grid that is particularly driven by growth in AI and data centers. Residents and existing businesses and industries are worried not just about high utility rates, but also about whether local power transmission infrastructure can handle surging demand without failure.

As Axios reported, former state lawmaker and director of Virginia's Department of Energy Glenn Davis said, ""This is the first time I've really seen energy as part of the conversation during election season.” The concerns have been so pronounced that Amazon Web Services withdrew a plan for a data center in Louisa County, specifically citing community opposition. For Virginians, the issue of data centers and the construction of power plants to support them will continue to loom large.

North Carolina faces the same debate. Data centers are multiplying in North Carolina, driven especially by demand for AI and cloud computing. The growth is creating large, new electricity loads that Duke Energy projects will require adding nearly 6 GW of capacity to meet, nearly double the 3.9 GW it predicted just last year. Like in Virginia, regulators and stakeholders are questioning how to meet that demand while maintaining the clean-energy and decarbonization goals of North Carolina House Bill 951. Duke Energy’s solution is to build a fleet of new gas power plants. Clean energy advocates argue for alternatives like solar and large battery storage. Many critics argue that the proposed data centers may not materialize. And just as in Virginia, a key issue is who will pay for improvements to the electrical grid.

The North Carolina Utilities Commission (prompted in part by filings from environmental nongovernmental organizations like The Southern Environmental Law Center) has begun to dig into questions of large-loads, how to plan for them, and what rules should govern them. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services has slated a $10 billion, 800-acre campus east of Charlotte for construction, while both Apple and Microsoft have large data centers planned for the areas west of the city as part of a “data center corridor.”

Unsurprisingly, the same issues are being raised in Ohio, where the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) has approved a new tariff requested by AEP Ohio (the investor utility providing electric service in the greater Columbus area) that requires large data centers to pay differently for electricity. Several major tech/data center-industry players, including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, alongside the Ohio Manufacturers Association, challenged the proposal, but PUCO denied their appeal.

According to the PUCO ruling, data centers will be charged a minimum of 85 percent of their projected usage, even if actual usage falls below that level. The plan includes a “load-ramp” requirement pursuant to which data centers must gradually come up to their full load, rather than immediate full demand. There is also an exit fee if a data center cancels its project or cannot meet its contractual obligations.

AEP Ohio argued that its system is under strain due to surging energy demand from data center projects. In central Ohio alone, AEP Ohio noted large signed capacity agreements to meet new data center load, plus many more proposed projects. The purpose is to ensure that the infrastructure and grid upgrades necessitated by new, large loads are paid for by the data center operators who create the demand, rather than being funded disproportionately by residential customers and existing businesses and industrial users.

Opponents, including The Data Center Coalition and some manufacturers, argue the new tariff is discriminatory and may overcharge data centers. They say the utility’s demand forecasts might be speculative or overstated. The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, seeing PUCO’s decision as unfair to high-energy industrial users.

Some see a potential solution to at least some of these issues in microgrids. A microgrid is a small network of electricity users with a local source of supply that may be attached to a centralized national grid, but which is able to function independently. Microgrids are becoming more relevant and necessary, not just for data centers but broadly across commercial, industrial, mission-critical, and even community/residential sectors. For instance, West Virginia passed a bill during the 2025 legislative session that created a structure to allow the construction of industrial microgrids that may alleviate some of the pressures on the larger electrical grid. Microgrid legislation is sure to be a live issue in most state legislatures during the coming years.

While Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio have been at the forefront on data center development issues, we are seeing data center development occurring around the country. Similarly, we are also seeing state regulators and legislators around the country grapple with how best to facilitate the growth of data centers and AI while also protecting existing customers. While there is currently no clear path forward, there is no doubt that these issues will continue to be top of mind.

Mountain Valley Pipeline Asks Intermediate Court of Appeals to Return Protest Lawsuit to Circuit Court

“The suit alleges that Martha Ann Zinn, the respondent in the first suit, attached herself to a piece of drilling equipment being used to construct the pipeline, and Mary Beth Naim, Judy Kay Smucker, and Jessica Grim blocked an access road.”

Why this is important: During the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, protestors impeded drilling and blocked access to the construction area. In response, the article points out that Mountain Valley Pipeline filed two separate lawsuits against the protestors alleging trespass, tortious interference, civil conspiracy, and violations of the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act. The Circuit Court ultimately dismissed both cases, ruling that Mountain Valley Pipeline did not possess enforceable property rights under the easement granted for pipeline installation. Mountain Valley Pipeline appealed the decision to the West Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were heard on September 16, 2025. The appeal raises a central legal question: whether an easement holder, right-of-way holder, or license holder has a legally protectable interest in the property they are authorized to use. --- Taiesha K. Morgan

UK-US Nuclear Deal: What does It Mean and will It Really Lead to a ‘Golden Age’?

“Starmer announced multibillion-pound link-up to build ‘mini-nukes’ likely to be signed during Trump visit.”

Why this is important: British Prime Minister Starmer recently announced a $100 billion partnership with the United States for five nuclear deals to build a fleet of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) in the UK. While there have been encouraging agreements and developments toward additional SMR capacity in recent years that have not been realized, this new round of cooperation between the UK and the U.S., despite traditional obstacles, may signal a significant step in reversing that trend as these projects are actually starting to move forward. This, in turn, could portend similar positive nuclear development outside of the UK. --- Barry A. Naum

IAEA Again Raises Global Nuclear Power Projections

“Noting recent momentum behind nuclear power, the International Atomic Energy Agency has revised up its projections for the expansion of nuclear power, estimating that global nuclear operational capacity will more than double by 2050—reaching 2.6 times the 2024 level—with small modular reactors expected to play a pivotal role in this high-case scenario.”

Why this is important: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has revised its nuclear power capacity projections and now reports an estimated increase in nuclear capacity by 2050 of well over 100 percent from 2024 levels. As stated by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, “Nuclear power is indispensable for achieving clean, reliable and sustainable energy for all.” Despite this truth, as of 2024, nuclear generation comprised only 8.7 percent of global electricity production. Therefore, if these high-end projections are accurate, such an increase in available nuclear capacity could provide a promising partial solution to the astronomical electricity demands expected in the near future as a result of data centers and other advanced technologies, coupled with the ongoing retirement of “fossil fuel” generation. Still, as considered and discussed by IAEA, a number of critical improvements in national policies, investment, and workforce development must occur in order to obtain the highest projections. --- Barry A. Naum

Natural Gas to Dominate U.S., China and India's Energy Mix By 2050

“The report says that scalability and commercial challenges are the biggest obstacles that will hinder a direct shift from coal to renewables, making natural gas a critical bridge in the global energy transition.”

Why this is important: S&P Global Commodity Insights predicts natural gas is the only fossil fuel likely to grow in the generation mix of the United States, China, and India by 2050. In the next 25 years, S&P Global sees renewables – solar and wind principally – only growing by 4 percent to 20 percent. Gas is the only fossil fuel expected to increase in all three of the world’s largest countries. Currently, coal-to-gas substitution has driven the energy transition in the U.S., Europe, and Southeast Asia. However, in the midst of these transitions, new reserves of fossil fuels are being confirmed. India still relies heavily on oil for its energy needs, and last year, four new basins predicted to have 22 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil were confirmed in the world’s second largest country. That amount is more oil than is left in the U.S. Permian Basin, which has produced 14 billion of its 34 billion barrels of recoverable oil. --- Mark E. Heath

Which Form of Energy is the Cheapest? CBS News Asked the Experts to Find Out.

“In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government.”

Why this is important: Per the article, CBS relied on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) in determining which electricity sources are most cost-effective. That’s fine as far as it goes, but it’s only half the story. A fair comparison arguably also considers the Levelized Avoided Cost of Energy (LACE), which measures the value of that energy source to the grid. It involves comparing the cost of the energy produced to the cost of the energy source it would replace, and takes into account factors like the inherent intermittency of wind and solar. If a project’s LACE exceeds its LCOE, it has value to the grid. In many cases, a power source might generate electricity at the lowest price per kilowatt, but be less valuable to the grid because its power isn’t available and can’t be dispatched when needed. --- David L. Yaussy

Morrisey Shares New Energy Plan for WV, Relying Heavily on Coal, Natural Gas to Grow Power Creation

“The plan — dubbed the ‘50 by 50’ generation plan by Morrisey — aims to see the state increase its power capacity from the current 15 gigawatt generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050.”

Why this is important: As detailed in the article, West Virginia’s Governor has announced a plan to more than triple the state’s electric power production capability within the next 25 years, in part as an aspiration to address the regional and national need for more power to meet demand associated with data center development and other energy-intensive formats. As described in the article, this ambitious plan specifically targets development of more fossil-fuel based power plants in the state, but downplays the viability of renewable power development. What remains unclear is who would build these new plants and who will bear the cost. On its face, the plan does little for existing West Virginia power consumers who have faced significant price increases over the last 15 years, particularly existing manufacturing and industrial companies that have already invested millions of dollars in West Virginia. Uncertainty also exists with respect to the proposed timeline; major fossil-fuel power plant development takes several years, and the plan would seemingly require that well more than a dozen such plants be built and energized within a relatively short period. Notwithstanding those key concerns, the plan certainly engages West Virginia’s place as an energy state and net exporter of power. --- Derrick Price Williamson

Which Countries Buy the Most U.S. Coal?

“The U.S. exported 97.6M tonnes of coal in 2024, representing 25% of its domestic coal production.”

Why this is important: Almost 25 percent of the coal mined in the U.S. is now exported. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency shows that in 2024, the United States exported 97.6 metric tons of coal (108 million U.S. tons). Fifty-seven percent of all exports went to five countries: 1) India, 23 percent at 22.9 million tons; 2) China, 12 percent at 11.3 million tons; 3) Japan, 8 percent at 8.2 million tons; 4) Brazil, 7 percent at 7.6 million tons; and 5) the Netherlands, 7 percent at 7.6 million tons. Since 2017, as European consumption has declined, Asia has become the largest U.S. market. The closest export market is Canada, which imported 3.9 percent of U.S. coal exported, at 3.8 million tons. As U.S. coal-fired plants have closed, the share of exported coal has replaced U.S. consumption of steam coal. --- Mark E. Heath

China Keeps Tight Grip on Rare Earths, Costing at Least One Company ‘Millions of Euros’

“The chamber also called on China to address several pain points for businesses as the country prepares its next five-year plan.”

Why this is important: The article reflects that amid ongoing trade tensions between China and several major economies, China has begun limiting foreign access to rare earth elements that are vital for technologies such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, medical imaging, and advanced defense systems. This shift coincides with global policy discussions addressing concerns about the environmental and economic impacts of overproduction in rare earth mining. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, China accounted for over 69 percent of global rare earth element mine production in 2024 and holds nearly half of the world’s known reserves. Recent Chinese export restrictions include the issuance of single-use export licenses and requirements that buyers certify the materials will not be used for military purposes.

The article points out that while some companies, such as Volkswagen, report stable supply chains, others claim to have been adversely affected by the new regulations. A member of an unnamed 25-year-old business stated they lost millions of euros due to increased regulation. A study by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that several companies have shifted planned investments away from China to other Southeast Asian nations in response to these changes. In an effort to address concerns, organizations like the European Chamber of Commerce have engaged in discussions with China’s Ministry of Commerce to advocate for more predictable access to rare earth materials.

This is important because, as China’s leadership prepares to outline future strategies for rare earth resource management, global policymakers are expected to monitor developments closely due to the significant role these materials play in the global economy. --- Taiesha K. Morgan

Pa. Electric Customers will Pay to Keep an Old Power Plant Running Under Federal Orders

“The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a plan that allows PJM Interconnection to recover its payments to the plant’s owner, Constellation Energy, from electricity users across its 13-state territory.”

Why this is important: The Trump administration’s Department of Energy has taken an aggressive approach with respect to fossil fuel plant retirements, exercising its authority to foreclose scheduled retirements of old, arguably uneconomic natural gas and coal-fired power plants. As noted in the article, DOE ordered one such plant owned by Constellation Energy in Pennsylvania (and another in Michigan) to remain operational, but extending the life of a plant that may not be actively dispatched except in more extreme or emergency conditions causes a cost, and that cost must be recovered. The article explains that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved a plan that would allow those costs to be recovered from all electric consumers in the “PJM” footprint, which includes Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and 11 other states in the region. The article captures that although existing fossil fuel-based power plants that can operate economically in the wholesale market for power on a daily basis are important for the power grid, federal policies that mandate the continued operation of uneconomic plants have cost consequences that will adversely impact consumers. --- Derrick Price Williamson

Virginia Energy Groups Urge State to Fight Federal Solar Grant Termination

“About half of Virginia households were expected to qualify for Solar For All, which sought to reduce energy bills by making solar power more affordable.”

Why this is important: The Commonwealth of Virginia is trying to figure out how to move forward after they had a $156 million grant cut after the Big Beautiful Bill was passed by Congress. The grant was a part of Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The article explains that the grant was going to be utilized for the upfront costs of installing solar panels on low to moderate income homes as part of a Solar For All plan. By installing solar panels and making solar power more accessible, the policy was intended to decrease the cost of energy bills. While solar energy is cheap to produce, the cost to install panels can range from $15,000 to $30,000, which is more than middle class and low-income families can spare for solar energy. Per the article, leaders of the Solar For All council are urging state leaders like Governor Glenn Youngkin to fight against the grant cut given preliminary state spending for the project and a plan to install panels on more than 15,000 homes, apartment buildings, and multi-family units. The impact will not only be on those who were to receive the solar panels on their homes, but also on those in the local solar power industry, who were anticipating the addition of about 1,000 jobs to the local solar industry in Virginia.

This is an important reflection of policy changes being implemented by the Trump administration – reducing or eliminating funding for renewable projects while attempting to support a commitment to further other energy sources like coal, oil, and gas. Questions also arise about whether the federal government has breached a legal obligation that Virginia relied on and if the Commonwealth has grounds to challenge the decision under administrative law in order to obtain the resources to finish the solar project. --- Nicholas A. Muto

New EIA Study Shows that CO2 Emissions have Declined 30 Percent Since 2005

“Over that time, total energy-related CO2 emissions in the United States fell 20 percent while the population grew by 14 percent.”

Why this is important: The total per-capita CO2 emissions in the U.S. are down 30 percent since 2005, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. In fact, CO2 emissions are down in every state, and the total U.S. drop of 20 percent of total CO2 emissions occurred while the U.S. population grew by 14 percent. EIA attributes the drop to less coal-fired generation, increases in solar and wind generation, and increases in gas-fired electrical generation. However, for 2025, the U.S. EIA sees a one percent increase in total CO2 emissions. Electric power generation was the greatest CO2 generator in 18 states, and five states – West Virginia, Wyoming, Kentucky, Missouri, and North Dakota -- generated half their electricity from burning coal. --- Mark E. Heath

America's Power Grid is No Match for the AI Data Center Boom

“Data center demand for computing facilities that can consume as much power as entire cities, but America's electrical grid is struggling to keep pace.”

Why this is important: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not new, but it has certainly taken center stage in national energy production and development discussions. The article amplifies that it is no surprise that the U.S. energy grid is old and in need of serious renovation. In addition to current development and consumer needs, AI centers are requesting and requiring a range of multiple gigawatts of power. Some analysts estimate that trillions of dollars are likely to be invested between now and 2030, with as much as $3 trillion by 2028. A key roadblock is the access to fundamental components needed for infrastructure upgrades, such as transformers. With supply chain delays, resource market fluctuation, and the ever-increasing competition from multiple market sources, the increased demand on the grid is also creating delays in the development of other legitimate projects because of the backlog of planned but possibly hypothetical AI data projects. Acres of space, gigawatts of power, and potential environmental consequences are the holy trinity of the AI frenzy. How the grid will sustain itself and expand to meet these demands is yet to be determined. --- Sophia L. Hines

New EV Battery Tech could Power 500-Mile Road Trips on a 12-Minute Charge

“An EV battery breakthrough from Korea could help give lithium-metal tech the green light.”

Why this is important: It seems like battery innovations are announced daily. This new discovery involves a new electrolyte that reduces dendrite formation, a common battery killer, which allows faster charging. Assuming that it can be produced cost-effectively, the article says that the battery would allow for charging to a 500-mile range in 12 minutes, which could be a key factor in convincing internal combustion engine owners to switch to electric vehicles. Charging so much, so fast would also require a huge electricity draw. Large supercharger stations with such fast charging could have the intermittent power demand of a small city, and require liquid-cooled charging cables. --- David L. Yaussy

Wind Turbine Market to Hit $325.6 B by 2034

“For example, Europe added more than 18 GW of wind energy in 2023 and will install 200 GW of new wind capacity from 2024–2030 to meet its climate energy targets.”

Why this is important: The global wind turbine market in 2024 was valued at $151.8 billion. Analysts are predicting it will more than double to $325.6 billion by 2034. The increases are driven by offshore wind and the general growth in renewables. In the next six years, Europe will add 200 GW of wind generation, which will lead to robust growth in the industry. The U.S. wind generation is predicted to grow by $3.4 billion by 2034. --- Mark E. Heath

Nuclear energy has moved from being a quiet constant to the centerpiece of a global race. Nations increasingly recognize that sovereignty—economic, technological, and cultural—depends on securing clean, stable, and independent sources of power.

COMMENTARY

Myrto Tripathi, who has spent years advancing nuclear in Europe, put it plainly when speaking to Phil Zeringue on The Future of Nuclear Energy Podcast: “Energy is the great enabler—it empowers people to make their own choices, to feed, cure, and house themselves, but also to respect the limits of our planet.”

Europe’s Lesson: Sovereignty through Nuclear

France’s reliance on nuclear power is no accident. Tripathi points back to the founding of the European Union:

“The founding fathers of the European Union bound themselves through nuclear power because it was seen as a source of peace and prosperity.”

For France and Europe, nuclear energy is not just an energy choice—it is a guarantor of independence as it pertains to political and economic terms.

That lesson resonates today, as Europe grapples with energy shocks and geopolitical threats. Nuclear remains the only scalable pathway that preserves both sovereignty and security.

U.S. Momentum and Market Leadership

The U.S. is showing renewed signs of momentum. A leading example comes from Texas, where Reed Clay, President of the Texas Nuclear Alliance, helped drive landmark legislation.

House Bill 14 established a dedicated nuclear office, created a streamlined permitting process, and allocated nearly half a billion dollars to attract investment.

“There’s a sense of urgency. If we don’t succeed now—if we don’t capitalize on the market forces and public support we have today—we may not get another opportunity,” said Clay.

This state-level leadership illustrates how the U.S. can reassert itself not only to secure energy reliability and economic growth, but to position itself in the global contest for influence.

What’s at Stake: China, AI, and Geopolitical Power

The contest is not limited to energy supply. It is about who will control the infrastructure underpinning the next industrial revolution: artificial intelligence. Data centers are projected to double electricity consumption by 2030. Only nuclear power can deliver the clean, always-on power they require.

China recognizes this. Beijing is building reactors at an unmatched pace, exporting nuclear capacity while bundling AI and digital infrastructure under its Belt and Road Initiative. This strategy links nuclear energy with technological dominance and geopolitical leverage.

Tripathi warns, “Nuclear sits at the nexus between human development and climate. Without it, nations risk being dependent on others for the most basic of needs.”

Clay echoes the strategic risk: “We can’t let Russia and China become the world’s exporters of nuclear energy. The U.S. has the resources, the will, and the track record to lead this race.”

And as Zeringue underscores, “Nuclear isn’t just about power plants—it’s about national security, economic stability, and the ability to stand independent in a rapidly changing world. The race is global, and the clock is ticking.”

The Path Forward

From Paris, to Washington, D.C., to Beijing, the message is converging. Nuclear energy is no longer a side conversation in climate or industrial policy. It is the central contest for sovereignty, security, and survival in the twenty-first century.

Tripathi calls it the enabler of dignity, prosperity, and development. Clay calls it the foundation of America’s competitive future. Zeringue calls it the cornerstone of national security.

The nuclear race is underway, and the stakes could not be higher. If democratic nations fail to lead, they risk becoming buyers rather than builders in the nuclear-AI economy. The question is not whether nuclear will define the future, but who will control it.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nuclear-mirion-technologies.png,N,,2025-10-13 16:02:32.735359

The facility is set to become a live testing environment for over 40 distinct sustainability strategies, which could provide a blueprint for integrating sustainable practices into logistics and industrial buildings without disrupting core business operations.

Kara Hurst, Amazon’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “In climate action, we need to move fast. So, our teams got creative and asked: ‘What if we created a real-world testing ground for some of the best sustainability initiatives in one place?’ That's exactly what we did at DII5 our brand-new mass timber delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana.”

Mass timber and lowering embodied carbon

The DII5 facility, designed by ZGF Architects, was constructed primarily from mass timber.

According to Amazon, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"".

The construction used Southern Yellow Pine cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels, glulam beams and wood fibre insulation.

The use of mass timber in construction can lower a building's embodied carbon compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete.

A testbed for sustainable innovation

The facility is designed to prove that sustainability can be integrated without compromising operational efficiency.

Amazon aims to use the findings from the test centre to scale sustainable projects.

Kara explains: “Buildings account for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, and with that in mind, we designed DII5 to be a working laboratory with dozens of solutions – from the walls, water and lighting to the desks where our employees work. The data we are gathering will help us determine which technologies and initiatives can be scaled across our global operations.

Scaling future and existing assets

Amazon will track a range of data points to assess the viability of these strategies for wider implementation.

""By testing several sustainability initiatives under one roof, we're accelerating our progress toward achieving scalability and standardisation of these initiatives across our building portfolio,"" says Daniel Mallory, VP of Global Realty at Amazon.

Daniel explains that the facility also serves as a ""'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing and resilient in a changing climate. The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction and operation of our spaces.""

He says Amazon will track ""multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity and other metrics. We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.""

The insights gained from the Indiana warehouse are not just for future constructions.

The project is intended to generate a catalogue of proven retrofittable solutions for Amazon's existing portfolio of buildings, making the facility a strategic tool for decarbonising a vast real estate footprint.

""While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future building design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing building portfolio,"" says Daniel.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ba9d63b9b3e769bb0963b8213e014e54:03227ffc75f56270b4708a62126f729f/testing1.png.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 14:02:23.084781

Forever War, Part 1: This story is published in partnership with The Assembly and with WHQR, a nonprofit radio station and NPR affiliate in Wilmington. It is the first in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina.

OAK ISLAND, N.C.—Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.

But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.

Donovan felt devastated and enraged.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”

In 2013, scientists first discovered several types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.

The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians with high levels of toxic PFAS.

It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators and local residents, started urging the EPA and the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to regulate the compounds.

Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found the compounds in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs and beer. Pine needles, honey and house dust. Landfills, compost and sewage sludge.

Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.

Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.

The celebration was brief.

Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin, with support from the chemical industry, was dismantling those hard-won protections.

And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

2013-2016: A Movement Is Born

The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.

On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was sending PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.

Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”

Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.

Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.

Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.

“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”

The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing and playing in contaminated water.

As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.

We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.

When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.

Then a freelance reporter for the Star-News of Wilmington, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings about GenX in the city’s drinking water.

People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.

“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”

2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear

Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.

She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.

In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.

The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.

In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.

Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.

2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature

Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr., is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.

Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.

Yet after a contentious Environmental Review Commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another hearing.

Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”

Davis, the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.

Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.

Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: A $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.

“We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”

2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer

Brian Long, then the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.

It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.

“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”

EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the thyroid, liver and kidneys.

Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer, also associated with GenX exposure.

Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.

Several advocates’ families were touched by disorders they felt might have been linked to PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.

Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.

Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.

She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”

One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.

“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.

The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”

2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal

Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:

Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin.

Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.

Steer the tired alligator to the bank.

Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).

Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.

Burdette helped NC State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators spend their long lives in water often polluted with chemicals; they can serve as models for detecting human health problems caused by contamination.

The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 different PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.

It had been more than a year since the contamination had become public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.

Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.

“We sued,” Burdette said.

SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act by discharging PFAS, including GenX, into the Cape Fear River.

By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.

“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”

By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.

No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.

DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.

“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”

In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.

“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”

Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.

“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”

At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.

“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”

Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”

Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.

2021-2022: Quest for Accountability

One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.

Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.

Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. NC State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.

In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.

“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”

The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.

In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.

The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.

2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers

Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.

Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA and environmental advocates had become impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.

He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.

Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.

“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”

Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.

“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”

Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.

Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”

Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.

“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“

The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $1 billion to help utilities in small or disadvantaged communities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, yet that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.

In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.

Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.

Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.

May 2025: The Persistent Republican

It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.

“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”

Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.

If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.

“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”

A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.

“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”

Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.

The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.

Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.

“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”

With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.

May 2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained

A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.

The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.

Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at NC State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.

Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.

After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.

“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.

“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”

June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill

Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.

A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”

“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”

The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.

Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.

Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.

The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.

September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX for Rollback

In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.

“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”

The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it allegedly did so out of sequence.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.

Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period. More than 120,000 comments were submitted, including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.

The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.

Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.

A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”

The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.

Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.

The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.

However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.

EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.

More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.

It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.

“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”

Regardless of what happens at the federal level, a DEQ spokesperson said the agency will continue to enforce the consent order. It is also gathering data from public water systems to help them meet the drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS by the new deadline of 2031.

Accounting for private wells and public drinking water systems, DEQ estimates 3.5 million North Carolinians are exposed to levels of PFAS above federal standards.

The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties.

This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing. Of those, state records show more than 22,000 have been sampled and nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.

Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.

DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

The orders spanned initiatives regarding nuclear fuel supply, waste management, workforce development, reactor exports, and more.

President Trump, noting that domestic fuel sources today supply only 5% of the fuel used in U.S. nuclear reactors, focused on reversing a 48-year-old policy that bars reprocessing of spent fuel for commercial reactors and on reinvigorating the mining of domestic deposits of uranium and thorium that can power advanced nuclear reactors.

Trump also noted that the U.S. record on building domestic nuclear power plants has been dismal (and that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been a chief obstacle) and took action to streamline the nuclear energy permitting process. His goal is to prioritize upgrades to existing nuclear reactors, build another 10 large reactors by the end of this decade, and promote advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors and microreactors.

The immediate reaction from the fusion industry to Trump’s election, according to Michael Heumann in The Fusion Report, was that his support for fossil fuels would take money away from fusion research but that -- because Trump wants to beat China in everything -- he would likely move fusion forward aggressively. The nuclear fission community also warmed to the prospect of a Trump-led nuclear renaissance.

Other voices, however, were not so sanguine. The potential for small modular fission reactors and even microreactors, as well as the hope for “free” energy from fusion, was not good news for some observers, notably “green” energy promoters and the ever-present nuclear fear community. Nuclear will always cost too much, say some, while to others nuclear will never be safe.

Claudia Lopez Lloreda, writing in Undark, criticized the Trump Administration for trying to rely on deregulation to “kickstart a nuclear renaissance.” She opposed any diminishment of NRC regulatory obstacles to nuclear energy development. She said experts are divided on whether any of these new nuclear technologies are worth the investment and agreed with Union of Concerned Scientists spokesperson Edwin Lyman that the nuclear energy field is “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations.”

Similarly, Beyond Nuclear’s Kevin Kamps argued that “irrational nuclear exuberance is reaching a pitch. Spiking electricity demand, cratering nuclear regulation, reckless nuclear boosterism, and federal attacks on renewables have produced a perfect storm fueling nuclear expansionism … that may blow us onto the rocks” and make climate change worse.

He decried the rise of “zombie nukes” – the restarting of Three Mile Island, Palisades , and Duane Arnold powerplants that were shut down decades ago. He mocked a “nuclear hubris” that emboldened NASA to pledge to put a reactor on the Moon by 2030. Worst of all, he claimed, are the “so-called ‘advanced’ reactors, including small modular reactors,” which he said are neither new nor small and probably not even modular – given that many of the 127 designs are speculative and have not ever been built.

But here’s the Catch-22.

The regulations were specifically designed to impede nuclear energy development, making nuclear energy infrastructure too expensive and too time-consuming to build. The huge cost overruns at the recently activated Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia bear witness to that thesis. Georgia Power began the permitting process for both units in 2008, but it was not until 2023 and 2024 that they finally went online.

Meanwhile, according to the Breakthrough Institute, nearly every Chinese nuclear project since 2010 has achieved construction in 7 years or less. Chinese financiers and builders also completed six nuclear reactors in Pakistan in less than six years each. Russia has been delivering finished reactors within 6-9 years; South Korea has built three reactors in the United Arab Emirates in under 9 years each.

This real-world trend, says Breakthrough, flies in the face of “the tiresome and longstanding claims” that nuclear reactors require a decade or longer (15 years for Georgia Power) to build. But Georgia Power had it relatively easy. A dozen U.S. states, representing 27% of all U.S. electricity customers, have laws restricting or forbidding deployment of new nuclear energy.

California’s 1976 moratorium on new nuclear facilities is two years older than Hawaii’s – and Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont all remain officially anti-nuclear. On the other hand, by the end of 2023, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Montana, West Virginia, and Wisconsin had repealed or modified existing laws stifling nuclear power plant deployment.

The Illinois Policy Institute, however, says that the state in 2023 only lifted limits on new (small modular) reactors generating under 300 MW, none of which are planned in Illinois. The 40-year-old ban on large-scale, grid-connected reactors remains intact – strangely, in a state with six operating nuclear power plants and 11 reactors that generate 54% of Illinois’ electricity.

Despite the naysayers, both fission and fusion startups have seen massive infusions of cash – concomitant with the anticipated restructuring of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission toward a more nuclear-friendly approach to permitting and oversight of nuclear reactors. As statutory and regulatory obstacles to a nuclear renaissance fade away, other challenges may be just as formidable – most notably, the challenge of securing reliable, affordable sources of nuclear fuels.

Irina Slav reports that tight supplies of uranium could interfere with global plans for increased nuclear power generation. With global uranium demand set to increase by over 30% -- to 86,000 tons – over the next four years and go nearly double that to 150,000 tons by 2040, supply will be shrinking, with output from existing mines set to fall by half between 2030 and 2040. Worse, it takes 10 to 20 years to bring a new uranium mine into production.

Pursuant to his July executive orders, President Trump has taken quick action to jumpstart U.S. efforts to secure an adequate nuclear fuel supply through the Department of Energy’s new Fuel Line Pilot Program. Six companies have been approved for pilot projects under the program to develop reactor-specific fuels.

The White House has also added South Dakota’s Dewer Burdock uranium mine project to its FAST-41 permitting process in an effort to resolve a multitude of administrative and court appeals that have bottled up this vital resource for years.

Still, securing long-term domestic supplies of nuclear reactor fuel may be just as difficult a task as building new nuclear reactors has been in the United States for the past half century. But China – and other nations – are still moving much more rapidly to build out a nuclear-powered future than the plodding, bickering U.S. electorate has allowed on our own soil.

And that should be of immense concern for those who value our future prosperity and freedom.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/699453_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-10-13 13:03:01.334405

Newsom vetoes energy bills on virtual power plants, load management, and interconnection

Utility Dive – October 6

Governor Gavin Newsom last week vetoed several pieces of energy legislation, including AB 740, which would have required the state to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan. In a letter to the governor last month, more than a dozen trade and environmental advocacy groups urged Newsom to sign AB 740 into law, claiming VPPs could save Californians $750 million per year in system costs and provide more than 7,500 MW of capacity. Newsom said that he supported the aim of harnessing distributed energy resources, but that the bill would have resulted in costs to the California Energy Commission’s primary operating fund, “which is currently facing an ongoing structural deficit.”

Who is Growing? U.S. Natural Gas Leaders

Key Takeaways

Shale Crescent USA leads U.S. natural gas leaders, adding 34 Bcf/d (351 Bcm/yr) since 2008—more than Texas, Louisiana, and the rest of the U.S. combined.

Natural gas in the Shale Crescent USA has grown more than any other region of the world over the last 20 years.

Each 1 Bcf/d (~10 Bcm/yr) serves about 5.5 million homes per day, highlighting industrial and consumer impact.

Gas production in different U.S. regions varies over time, but which region has had the highest growth in output in recent years?

This map, created in partnership with Shale Crescent USA, shows where natural gas production growth from 2008 to 2024 is concentrated, using data from the EIA.

Shale Crescent in the Lead

Here is a table showing 2008–2024 growth in Billion Cubic Feet Per Day (Bcf/d) and Billion Cubic Meters Per Year (Bcm/yr) for each region.

From 2008–2024, Shale Crescent USA (Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania) grew by 34 Bcf/d (351 Bcm/yr), outpacing the Gulf Coast’s 16 Bcf/d (165 Bcm/yr) and the rest of the U.S. at 6 Bcf/d (62 Bcm/yr).

Notably, the Shale Crescent’s growth exceeded Texas, Louisiana, and the rest of the U.S. combined. Additionally, 1 Bcf/d (~10 Bcm/yr) can supply roughly 5.5 million U.S. single-family homes per day, underscoring the scale of this surge.

Why Such Large Growth?

Shale Crescent USA’s remarkable growth stems from technological breakthroughs that unlocked vast energy resources within world-class rock formations. This region was the birthplace of the oil and gas industry more than 150 years ago, and it remains a global leader. No other area on Earth has experienced greater growth over the past two decades.

The Marcellus and Utica shale formations hold one of the largest, most prolific gas endowments in North America, giving gas producers a deep inventory of high-quality drilling locations.

The second key driver is infrastructure and market access. As demand shifted toward gas-fired power—especially in the Northeast—new and expanded pipelines connected Marcellus/Utica volumes to nearby load centers and, increasingly, to the Midwest and Gulf Coast.

Landmark projects such as Shell’s ethane cracker in Pennsylvania, Nucor’s steel plant in West Virginia, and Intel’s semiconductor facility in Ohio, along with a growing number of data centers and other energy-intensive users, are benefiting from this region’s reliable and affordable energy supply.

The launch took place during the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress 2025, which is being held at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi) from 9-15 October.

The initiative's pavilion at the conference showcased a range of innovative initiatives developed by EAD in collaboration with its partners, including a large-scale project to restore mangrove habitats in cooperation with Nabat Company, its technology and implementation partner. Using modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and drones, the project will collect and analyse high-resolution data from satellites and drones to identify optimal areas for mangrove planting, efficiently scatter seeds with minimal waste and monitor plant growth after planting.

A model of an advanced AI-powered autonomous robot vehicle was also displayed. The robot, developed in collaboration with Micropolis Robotics, is intended for use in environmental monitoring and local vegetation restoration programmes. The vehicle’s automated features enable it to prepare and till the soil and carry out irrigation operations in seed-scattering areas to increase the chances of germination. The vehicle is also equipped with a drone for monitoring, mapping and seed-scattering purposes.

Her Excellency Dr Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of EAD, said: “The launch of the Nature X Abu Dhabi initiative embodies our commitment to employing the latest scientific and technological innovations to conserve, protect, and monitor the environment, and to enhance cooperation between national and international institutions in the field of nature conservation. The initiative also contributes to supporting the national strategic goals for sustainable development and ensuring the sustainability of natural resources for the benefit of future generations.”

Growing up “wildly into cars,” Scaringe said he knew as a 10-year-old that he wanted to one day start his own car company.

“I didn’t really know what that meant. I certainly had no idea how hard that was going to be and then subsequently started working towards it,” Scaringe told the Business Journal in an exclusive interview.

Scaringe has succeeded in an industry that has had few startups because of high capital costs. He has convinced investors like Amazon, Ford and Volkswagen to pony up billions.

He started a factory in Illinois that’s scheduled to produce as many as 43,500 vehicles this year. Rivian last month broke ground on a $5 billion factory in Georgia with a goal of annually making up to 400,000 vehicles.

“It’s just a very hard business to build, and so hard that most entrepreneurs, I should say, are highly idealistic and optimistic,” Scaringe said. “And as I reflect back, it’s good that I was so idealistic.”

While the share price has faded after its exuberant initial public offering in 2021, the company still sports a $16 billion market valuation with sales that are expected to reach $5.3 billion this year and then accelerate 33% to $7 billion in 2026.

Even with the end of federal EV tax credits, the founder is holding onto his vision.

“I’ve said this many times: I’ve never been as confident as I am today about what our trajectory looks like.”

With about 1,800 employees in Orange County, it is the largest automaker with operations here.

The Beginning

Scaringe dove into the car industry as a teen. He gained experience restoring cars, then jumped to a machine shop in his Florida hometown, where he worked until he went to college. Scaringe studied mechanical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York City and then pursued his PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

In 2009, Scaringe founded Rivian right out of school.

“I knew I wanted to start a car company, but then as I started to think about it more, I realized I wanted to start something that was going to help make these things that I love so much less bad,” he said with a laugh.

“I realized the cars that I adored and I enjoyed being around and working on were part of so many of our big geopolitical and social challenges.”

Whether those conflicts were about oil, local air quality or the general climate, Scaringe said he was motivated to figure out how to make more efficient cars.

“To me, it’s so clear, it’s indisputable that I can’t even imagine a future state where in the fullness of time—now whether that’s 10 years from now or 50 years from now—that everything on the road is electric.”

Scaringe designed Rivian to be a major part of this transition.

The entrepreneur said he initially started with a sports car but shifted to an SUV and truck instead, knowing these were top-selling vehicle types.

“That is something we’re deeply convicted in. And part of why Rivian exists is to help make really exciting and engaging electric vehicles that, regardless of your views on sustainability or climate, it’s just a better product.”

Not the Classic Startup Story

Scaringe said that one of the biggest challenges of starting an automotive company was the amount of capital required to stay afloat and scale.

“You need a lot of capital to develop the technology. You need technology to raise the capital,” he said.

“For a hardware business, it’s the hardest part. It’s very different than a typical software business, where you can do a Series A financing and launch it out of your house or out of your dorm room, which is the classic story.

“I used to say all the time, if you had $5 billion, a 4,000-person engineering team, a manufacturing plant, 300 to 400 willing suppliers, and you had all those things at the very, very beginning, it would still take you four years to launch the first product,” Scaringe added. “And the challenge is you have none of those things.”

Scaringe took Rivian public in 2021 with that year’s largest initial public offering (IPO) of almost $12 billion. Its market cap soared above $120 billion shortly thereafter.

Rivian has since released the R1 SUV and truck alongside its electric commercial delivery vans, which are used by Amazon.

Next in the lineup are the smaller and less expensive R2 SUVs, set to arrive in 2026, and the R3 models—which were revealed in 2024 at Rivian’s retail showroom in Laguna Beach.

Manufacturing currently takes place out of a 4.3-million-square-foot facility in Normal, Illinois. Rivian in September broke ground on its long-awaited plant in Georgia, where it plans to manufacture the R2 and R3 platforms starting in 2028. The secondary outpost is expected to generate 400,000 units of annual production capacity.

Volkswagen Group is Rivian’s most recent believer. After forming a joint venture in 2024, the Irvine automaker unlocked a $1 billion equity investment from Volkswagen after reporting its second consecutive quarter of gross profit in May; it was funded during the second quarter ended June.

In total, the JV deal secured $5.8 billion from the German manufacturer to further develop Rivian’s in-vehicle software.

Unlocking Growth with the R2

Since going public four years ago, Rivian has had a long list of things to prove to investors and Wall Street. At press time, the company has a $15.7 billion market cap with shares trading around $13.14 apiece.

As of now, Scaringe said it’s no longer about whether customers are going to buy the EVs.

“When an investor looks at Rivian today, they’re not questioning the demand generation capabilities because of the success of R1,” he said.

Esquire named the Tri-Motor R1S the publication’s Car of the Year for 2025. In California, the R1 is the best-selling premium SUV, EV or non-EV, over $70,000 according to the state’s New Car Dealers Association in 2024.

“It’s, ‘can we ramp R2, and can we grow awareness beyond the coast?’” Scaringe said.

In Orange County, Rivian sales are down 11% to 999 through the first eight months of 2025; its market share is 0.9%, according to the OC Automobile Dealers Association.

By contrast, rival Tesla also saw its sales fall 15% to 15,910; it has a 13.9% market share, lagging only Toyota, which has an 18.1% share. During the same period, overall vehicle sales climbed 2.1% to 114,105 in Orange County.

The CEO said that the R2 will be the key to unlocking future growth. And so far, production is on track.

The vehicle puts Rivian into a lower price point with the R2 starting around $45,000, compared to the R1’s average price tag of $90,000. And the R3 crossovers will be priced even lower.

With the R2’s smaller price point, it reaches “the full breadth of the market.”

“All the things we’ve done in R2 are built off of learnings we’ve had from R1,” Scaringe said. “We took everything we did on R1—which is an amazing car—we refactored into a smaller form, much smaller, and took a lot of cost out.”

“Just bringing that to market is going to open up a whole new aperture of different types of customers who can come into the brand,” he added.

Rivian recently narrowed its delivery outlook for 2025 to a range of 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles, from its previous guidance of 40,000 to 46,000.

Scaringe said the R2 release will be responsible for generating a “tremendous amount of growth.”

He said he’d be “happy” if the company could get a sizeable fraction of the huge market for the R2 vehicle type—5-seater, two row SUVs.

“We’re right bullseye in the biggest market, priced perfectly with the right segment.

From Their Eyes

Underneath that photo of RJ Scaringe at around 10 years old driving a go-kart is a picture of his oldest son Pete also riding in a go-kart. The nine-year-old recently starred in Rivian

Automotive’s latest commercial called “What If.”

Scaringe said it was around this age when he knew that he was going to create a car company.

Cut to founding Rivian in 2009, moving to California a few years later and now raising his three sons Pete, Max and Miles in Orange County, Scaringe is preparing to launch the second iteration of Rivian vehicles in 2026—the R2.

When looking back on the moments leading up to now, Scaringe thinks about his children when they launched the first car.

“They were born into this environment of ‘Dad is working on this car,’ and for their lives until end of 2021, it was this abstract thing, because there was no car out there,” he said.

The R1 rolled out to customers in November 2021, around the same time Rivian went public.

“So seeing it through their eyes, that suddenly this thing that Dad was working on became a thing that their friends at school would talk about and they would see, it was sort of surreal,” Scaringe said.",https://ocbj.wppcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RIVIAN-founder-NEW-scaled-e1760131871557.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 13:01:40.782867

John McCarrick, the company’s new head of Global Energy Policy, was a senior energy policy advisor in the first Trump administration’s Bureau of Energy Resources in the Department of State while under former Secretaries of State Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo.

As deputy assistant secretary for Energy Transformation and the special envoy for International Energy Affairs, McCarrick promoted exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and advocated for Asian countries to invest in natural gas.

The choice to hire McCarrick matches the intentions of OpenAI’s Trump-donating CEO Sam Altman, who said in a U.S. Senate hearing in May that “in the short term, I think [the future of powering AI] probably looks like more natural gas.”

It also aligns with the company’s early moves toward powering new data centers, huge warehouses full of linked-up computers that require enormous quantities of water and electricity, to run with gas. OpenAI’s U.S. Stargate Project site in Texas, which is slated to become one of the largest data center sites in the world, is already installing off-grid gas turbines to power its operations.

“Big Tech’s collusion with the Trump administration’s fossil fuel agenda for artificial intelligence is evident in their massive investment in methane gas power infrastructure — as well as pro-gas political operatives like McCarrick,” Tyson Slocum, director of consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen’s Energy Program, said.

The “solution” of powering AI with gas is part of Trump’s AI energy policy platform. In a July speech to announce a $96 billion AI and energy funding package, Trump lauded fossil fuel and coal-powered data center development while flanked by oil and gas executives.

By installing gas turbines to power its data centers, OpenAI has joined a growing cadre of tech giants, including Meta, xAI, and Microsoft, that have begun installing gas-powered generators at their data center sites to meet the surging energy demands of the supercomputer complexes.

OpenAI has additionally chosen not to disclose the carbon footprint of ChatGPT-5, its most advanced AI model to date, despite the fact that researchers told the Guardian it uses “a significantly larger amount of energy” than responses from GPT-40. The company, which is rapidly expanding internationally, does not have formally announced climate or sustainability targets.

Altman has also expressed that he thinks artificial intelligence will solve climate change, despite the fact that the technology’s voracious, ever-expanding demand for electricity poses a serious threat to net-zero targets worldwide.

“I don’t want to say this because climate change is so serious and so hard of a problem,” Altman said in a 2023 interview. “But I think once we have a really powerful superintelligence, addressing climate change will not be particularly difficult for a system like that.”

As Altman’s energy pick, McCarrick has a long history of hawking oil and gas. Previously, McCarrick advised on energy policy for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s 2012 election campaign. At the time, Romney, who did not mention climate change in his energy platform, held the stance that the U.S. should ramp up coal and other forms of fossil fuel production.

Even earlier, as a senior energy policy advisor for the McCain-Palin campaign in 2008, McCarrick claimed to be the source of its “‘all of the above’ energy strategy” in his LinkedIn profile.

At a campaign rally during the 2008 presidential campaign, vice presidential candidate and then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin adopted the phrase, announcing: “John [McCain] and I will adopt the all of the above approach,” she said, listing a variety of cleaner energy sources before adding, “we’ll develop clean coal technology, and we’ll drill for the billions of barrels of oil and that we have right now warehoused underground including our resources offshore. We will drill here and drill now — and here’s where you chant ‘drill baby drill.’”

Hiring a former member of Trump’s team aligns OpenAI even more closely to the current Trump administration.

OpenAI’s CEO Altman already donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund. He also accompanied Trump to the UK in September for the president’s second state visit where Trump announced the U.S.-UK Technology Prosperity Deal.

Altman’s history with climate deniers goes back to the roots of his career. His mentor is Peter Thiel, Paypal founder and CEO of data analytics software giant Palantir, who has a history of climate denialist statements. Thiel is also a long-time Trump donor, having given at least $1.75 million to Trump campaigns from 2016 to 2020.

The Palantir CEO has claimed climate science is “fake science,” has called climate activist Greta Thunberg the “anti-Christ,” and has funded a science journal that publishes climate denial.

In 2022, Altman also donated over $32,000 to climate denier Michael Shellenberger’s failed campaign for governor of California.

Shellenberger has made extensive claims denying the severity of climate change, including that “humans are not causing a ‘sixth mass extinction,’” “the Amazon is not ‘the lungs of the world,’” and “climate change is not making natural disasters worse.”

Shellenberger is well known for his advocacy for nuclear energy. When he announced his run for governor on the Joe Rogan podcast, he argued that “nuclear power is the future.”

Shellenberger’s views on nuclear power align with Altman’s own long-held positions on energy. In a 2015 blog on Altman’s personal website, he argued, “The 20th century was the century of carbon-based energy. I am confident the 22nd century is going to be the century of atomic energy.”

Altman then expresses doubt as to the energy sources of our own era: “I am unsure how the majority of the 21st century will be powered,” he wrote.",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Slide1.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 16:02:56.209909

Governor Kathy Hochul made the announcement while participating in the U.S Climate Alliance roundtable on September 24, as she announced the next steps for the Sustainable Future Program, which will accelerate capital projects in New York’s transition to a cleaner, greener future. The historic investment — the largest climate investment in New York’s history — will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for New Yorkers, and slash harmful emissions in the face of federal rollbacks.

“New York is a national leader in climate action, and we’re proving that we can build a thriving green economy while protecting our planet,” Governor Hochul said. “While others may retreat, we are doubling down. The $1 billion investment from our Sustainable Future Program will directly benefit New Yorkers by making our homes more energy-efficient, our schools healthier, and our communities more resilient. We are creating jobs, improving public health, and ensuring a just and affordable transition for every community.”

$200 million is dedicated to expanding thermal energy networks, which use a system of pipes to share heating and cooling resources among multiple buildings. This funding will support projects at municipal and state-owned buildings, and will specifically include several projects within the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including Stony Brook.

“We’re grateful for Governor Hochul’s ongoing dedication to advancing New York’s clean energy future,” said William Herrmann, vice president for facilities and services and chief sustainability officer. “This investment empowers Stony Brook to deploy cutting-edge thermal energy systems that lower carbon emissions and boost campus-wide efficiency.

The collaboration is centred on Airbus's objective to lower its environmental footprint, with Siemens' Buildings business leading the contract, supported by Capgemini. This alliance combines expertise in sustainability and digitalisation to help achieve specific environmental targets.

The initiative is a component of a wider programme at Airbus to diminish its operational environmental impact. According to the programme's targets, Airbus aims for a 20% reduction in energy consumption and an 85% cut in Scope 1 and 2 stationary emissions by 2030.

As part of the agreement, Siemens will implement scalable decarbonisation solutions designed for selected Airbus manufacturing sites. The goal is to abate 80 kt of CO2e annually from 2030. These solutions, delivered with Capgemini, include renewable energy integration, smart energy management and low-carbon heat systems.

A Strategic Alliance for Industrial Resilience

Capgemini's role in the initial phase involves consulting activities, defining governance and supporting project management and planning. Capgemini also contributes its experience in the digitalisation and automation of energy monitoring and measurement systems, a critical component for modern manufacturing facilities.

Susanne Seitz, CEO of Buildings at Siemens Smart Infrastructure, says: “Our collaboration with Airbus is built on years of mutual trust and shared ambition. It highlights Siemens’ capability to deliver smart and scalable technologies and services to reduce the carbon footprint of Airbus.”

Florent Massou dit Labaquere, EVP Operations of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, says the agreement will “keep Airbus on the right path”.

He adds: “We’re proud to be taking this important step toward making our operations more energy-efficient and future-ready. Collaborating with trusted partners is key in building a more resilient industrial footprint. The site-specific expertise from our Airbus colleagues in the UK and the US combined with Siemens’ technical know-how will keep us on the path toward meeting our energy use and emission reduction targets.”

A Roadmap to Greener Operations

The project's initial phase commenced in the summer of 2025, focusing on the creation of decarbonisation roadmaps for each manufacturing location. Following this, engineering studies will inform the implementation process, with the rollout of new infrastructure scheduled to begin in 2026. Siemens may also take on the operation and maintenance of this infrastructure to ensure long-term efficiency.

Seitz adds: “At Siemens, we’re committed to making the energy transition not only sustainable, but also achievable and scalable, so that Airbus and other industrial leaders can confront climate challenges while boosting operational resilience and long-term competitiveness.”

The brand is about to launch the all-electric version of its iconic Twingo, which promises a starting price of around 17,000, directly challenging the low-cost models that have flooded the market.

The announcement has generated a lot of uncertainty about the level and quality of this new car and at the same time, there is doubt about whether it can really be a competition for electric car companies that have been in the market for some time and have a certain advantage.

Renault changes its strategy

This radical change in Renault's strategy is based on the widespread adoption of lithium iron phosphate battery chemistry. Unlike the nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries traditionally used in Europe, these offer unavoidable advantages in terms of stability, service life and, crucially, cost. According to the company, this technological transition will allow a reduction of up to 40% in the production costs of its new electric cars.

The decision to embrace this new technology is a direct response to growing economic pressure from Chinese manufacturers such as BYD, MG and Leapmotor, who have used these cheaper batteries to offer competitive vehicles on the continent.

But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget.
That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.","Michigan’s $81 billion budget axes much of state government’s economic development spending, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature program designed to aid automakers’ transition to electric vehicles, which isn’t going so well.

Business lobbying groups that represent thousands of employers are exasperated.

The fiscal 2026 budget, heavily driven by the road repair and public safety priorities of Trumpian state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), ends funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR.

SOAR was created by Whitmer and the Legislature in 2021 as a panicked response to Ford Motor Co. blindsiding the state by announcing a record $11.4 billion investment in a battery plant and vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky.

Lawmakers dropped $500 million from the corporate income tax into the SOAR fund in each of the past three years. But the new budget allocates no new cash for the business attraction fund.

Hall, who in an interview earlier this year complained that Michigan CEOs have gone “woke,” said whatever might replace SOAR will “end the days of cash giveaways, once and for all.”

The budget also cuts $40.7 billion from business attraction and community development money administered by the Michigan Economic Development Corp., just over 40% of the $100 million allocated in the fiscal 2025 budget that ended Sept. 30.

Lawmakers also nixed $10 million Whitmer requested to implement population growth recommendations from her 2023 Growing Michigan Together Council report.

“These incentives have made the state a more attractive place to do business,” MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber that promotes the state’s auto industry, said in a statement. “(W)ithout an attractive suite of incentives, or a closing fund, Michigan businesses are at a disadvantage compared to national competitors with more resources of this sort.”

The cuts run so deep that the MEDC put out a news release telling the world it’s still in business.

What’s happening here is a growing bipartisan discontent over the value of business attraction incentives to create a significant number of good-paying jobs at a time when Michigan’s workforce is shrinking and the state is becoming steadily poorer compared to most states.

Michigan has fallen to 40th in per capita income, its lowest ranking ever, and slightly lower than the adjoining states of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.

Minnesota’s per capita income of $74,943 in 2024 led the Great Lakes states last year, while Illinois was second at $74,197. Michigan trailed far behind at $63,221.

Business lobbying groups claim other changes and cuts in the new state budget will make it harder for them to develop talent and invest in innovations.

The budget cuts $22 million from the Going Pro Talent Fund, which gives job training grants to businesses.

And it decouples state and federal business taxes so that businesses won’t be able to take advantage of accelerated deduction schedules for capital expenditures under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on their state taxes.

Decoupling prevents state government from losing $2 billion over the next five years, money it plans to spend on roads. A coalition of business groups regards the decoupling as a massive tax hike that will make investing in Michigan more expensive than in other states.

The “budget lands as our employers face a disproportionate risk from tariffs, the trade war and increasing uncertainty around electrification policies . . . adding further financial strain to many of our hometown companies,” Detroit Regional CEO Sandy Baruah said in a statement.

But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget. The state has been losing ground to competing states for decades, regardless of which political party has controlled Lansing.

It’s long past time for policymakers to chart a new course for the state’s economy.

They can start by finally recognizing that chasing factory jobs is not the path to prosperity. Policymakers (and many of the rest of us) have a hard time accepting that the economy has shifted to services where most middle-class jobs are in labs and offices, not plant floors.

It was quite a tell when Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley recently said some of the automakers’ younger hourly workers told him they needed three jobs to make ends meet. Even the “old-timers” told Farley that working in the company’s plants is no longer a viable career.

Despite President Donald Trump’s ballyhooed effort to restore manufacturing by hitting imported goods with stiff tariffs, the U.S. has lost 78,000 manufacturing jobs since August 2024. Michigan accounted for 9,000 of those lost jobs in that period.

Most states with high incomes and vibrant job markets have diverse economies and lots of college graduates. That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/img_8781-1024x7681760369981.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=UAoSbi1R,N,,2025-10-13 13:04:00.839306

Business lobbying groups claim other changes and cuts in the new state budget will make it harder for them to develop talent and invest in innovations.
But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget.
That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.","Michigan’s $81 billion budget axes much of state government’s economic development spending, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature program designed to aid automakers’ transition to electric vehicles, which isn’t going so well.

Business lobbying groups that represent thousands of employers are exasperated.

The fiscal 2026 budget, heavily driven by the road repair and public safety priorities of Trumpian state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), ends funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR.

SOAR was created by Whitmer and the Legislature in 2021 as a panicked response to Ford Motor Co. blindsiding the state by announcing a record $11.4 billion investment in a battery plant and vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky.

Lawmakers dropped $500 million from the corporate income tax into the SOAR fund in each of the past three years. But the new budget allocates no new cash for the business attraction fund.

Hall, who in an interview earlier this year complained that Michigan CEOs have gone “woke,” said whatever might replace SOAR will “end the days of cash giveaways, once and for all.”

The budget also cuts $40.7 billion from business attraction and community development money administered by the Michigan Economic Development Corp., just over 40% of the $100 million allocated in the fiscal 2025 budget that ended Sept. 30.

Lawmakers also nixed $10 million Whitmer requested to implement population growth recommendations from her 2023 Growing Michigan Together Council report.

“These incentives have made the state a more attractive place to do business,” MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber that promotes the state’s auto industry, said in a statement. “(W)ithout an attractive suite of incentives, or a closing fund, Michigan businesses are at a disadvantage compared to national competitors with more resources of this sort.”

The cuts run so deep that the MEDC put out a news release telling the world it’s still in business.

What’s happening here is a growing bipartisan discontent over the value of business attraction incentives to create a significant number of good-paying jobs at a time when Michigan’s workforce is shrinking and the state is becoming steadily poorer compared to most states.

Michigan has fallen to 40th in per capita income, its lowest ranking ever, and slightly lower than the adjoining states of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.

Minnesota’s per capita income of $74,943 in 2024 led the Great Lakes states last year, while Illinois was second at $74,197. Michigan trailed far behind at $63,221.

Business lobbying groups claim other changes and cuts in the new state budget will make it harder for them to develop talent and invest in innovations.

The budget cuts $22 million from the Going Pro Talent Fund, which gives job training grants to businesses.

And it decouples state and federal business taxes so that businesses won’t be able to take advantage of accelerated deduction schedules for capital expenditures under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on their state taxes.

Decoupling prevents state government from losing $2 billion over the next five years, money it plans to spend on roads. A coalition of business groups regards the decoupling as a massive tax hike that will make investing in Michigan more expensive than in other states.

The “budget lands as our employers face a disproportionate risk from tariffs, the trade war and increasing uncertainty around electrification policies . . . adding further financial strain to many of our hometown companies,” Detroit Regional CEO Sandy Baruah said in a statement.

But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget. The state has been losing ground to competing states for decades, regardless of which political party has controlled Lansing.

It’s long past time for policymakers to chart a new course for the state’s economy.

They can start by finally recognizing that chasing factory jobs is not the path to prosperity. Policymakers (and many of the rest of us) have a hard time accepting that the economy has shifted to services where most middle-class jobs are in labs and offices, not plant floors.

It was quite a tell when Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley recently said some of the automakers’ younger hourly workers told him they needed three jobs to make ends meet. Even the “old-timers” told Farley that working in the company’s plants is no longer a viable career.

Despite President Donald Trump’s ballyhooed effort to restore manufacturing by hitting imported goods with stiff tariffs, the U.S. has lost 78,000 manufacturing jobs since August 2024. Michigan accounted for 9,000 of those lost jobs in that period.

Most states with high incomes and vibrant job markets have diverse economies and lots of college graduates. That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8781-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 12:06:16.203119

These evaluations include unreasonable risks to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant to the risk evaluation under the specified conditions of use (COUs).
Notably, if the proposed rule is finalized and subsequently challenged, as anticipated, the courts will not defer to either of the EPA’s interpretations.
The proposed rule would allow the EPA to consider occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial engineering controls, in chemical risk evaluations and risk determinations—something previously prohibited under the 2017 rule.
4 “Weight of scientific evidence” means “an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a new rule to revise how it evaluates the risks of chemicals currently in use under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). This initiative follows a review prompted by Executive Order 14219 and aims to streamline evaluations while aligning with the current administration’s interpretation of TSCA. In response to concerns from the chemical industry and other stakeholders about the burden and complexity of the current risk evaluation process, the proposed modifications aim to streamline evaluations, increase transparency, and ensure a more predictable regulatory process for manufacturers (including importers) of chemical substances.

TSCA requires the EPA to prioritize and evaluate high-priority substances from the TSCA inventory. Risk evaluations under TSCA are primarily initiated by the EPA, either through its prioritization process or in response to manufacturer requests.1 These evaluations are triggered by statutory requirements, emerging scientific evidence, or industry interest in clearing regulatory uncertainty around specific chemicals.2

The EPA uses risk evaluations to determine whether an existing chemical poses an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment—based solely on scientific risk, not costs or other nonrisk factors. These evaluations include unreasonable risks to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant to the risk evaluation under the specified conditions of use (COUs). COUS are the circumstances under which a chemical is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, processed, distributed, used, or disposed of.

The EPA initially issued its procedural framework rule in 2017 and then revised it in 2024 under the Biden administration to require a single, comprehensive risk determination for each chemical across all COUs. EPA wants to return to evaluating each COU separately, reversing the 2024 rule and returning to the approach established during the first Trump administration.3 The EPA is seeking public comment on whether the procedural framework rule should include regulatory text specifying that the EPA has discretion to exclude COUs, exposure pathways, and routes and to coordinate actions with other EPA-administered laws to ensure that chemical risks “could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent” by other EPA actions, as permitted under TSCA section 9(b). Notably, if the proposed rule is finalized and subsequently challenged, as anticipated, the courts will not defer to either of the EPA’s interpretations. Instead, they will focus on determining the best interpretation of the statute consistent with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024).

The proposed rule would allow the EPA to consider occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial engineering controls, in chemical risk evaluations and risk determinations—something previously prohibited under the 2017 rule. This change could reduce findings of unreasonable risk in well-controlled workplace settings. Additionally, the rule would modify the regulatory definitions section in numerous ways, including by eliminating “overburdened communities” from the list of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” that must be considered in evaluations and by incorporating the definition of “weight of scientific evidence” from Section 2(e) of Executive Order 14303. These changes would influence how the EPA evaluates scientific data in its regulatory decisions.4

Finally, as proposed, the rule would require manufacturers (including importers) requesting a risk evaluation to submit less information and only that which is relevant to the COU or COUs identified in the risk evaluation request. These procedural changes would apply to all risk evaluations initiated on or after the date of the final rule and, to the extent practicable, to risk evaluations that are in process as of the date of the final rule but not yet finalized.

The deadline for submitting comments on the proposed rule is 7 November 2025.5

1 Section 6(b)(2) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(2), (4)(C)(ii). The EPA must always have at least 20 high-priority and 20 low-priority chemicals in process.

2 Section §6(b)(4) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(4). A manufacturer or consortia of manufacturers can formally request a risk evaluation of a specific chemical substance by submitting a request with supporting information on the chemical’s conditions of use and by covering a percentage of the associated costs. The EPA has discretion to grant or deny the request.

The company revealed it has completed all baseline studies required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a crucial step before formal environmental reviews and government permitting can begin. The reports were officially filed with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), since the Tonopah Flats project sits on federally managed land.

According to a company spokesperson, this milestone marks the completion of more than two years of intensive work and comprehensive third-party environmental evaluations. The achievement represents a crucial advancement in establishing domestic lithium production capabilities that will help support the United States’ electric vehicle manufacturing and battery technology objectives.

Paving the Way for U.S. Lithium Independence

Lithium — often called “white gold” — is a critical component of modern electric vehicle (EV) batteries. As global demand accelerates, analysts say projects like Tonopah Flats could play a vital role in reducing America’s reliance on imported materials from China and South America.

American Battery’s Tonopah Flats site is among the largest known lithium claystone deposits in the country. The company has emphasized that its sustainable extraction process and domestic production model could make it a cornerstone of America’s green manufacturing future.

The baseline studies, conducted in partnership with environmental consultants and local agencies, analyzed key factors such as air quality, wildlife, hydrology, and cultural resources — all prerequisites for moving into the environmental impact assessment phase.

A Stock on Fire

Following the announcement, ABAT stock quickly became the top-trending equity on Stocktwits, with retail investor sentiment spiking into what the platform described as “extremely bullish” territory.

Trading volume surged as social media investors celebrated the company’s progress toward commercialization — a milestone many viewed as a turning point in the race to establish U.S.-based lithium supply chains.

The stock traded over 34% higher by late morning, with momentum fueled by optimism that the NEPA completion will accelerate permit approvals and potential partnerships.

The Bigger Picture: America’s Battery Boom

The development also comes as the Biden administration pushes for greater domestic sourcing of clean energy minerals, a key part of its climate and manufacturing policies. With electric vehicle adoption soaring, demand for lithium is projected to triple by 2030, according to industry analysts.

A market analyst emphasized that obtaining domestic lithium sources has moved beyond being a choice to becoming a critical requirement for maintaining national competitiveness. The expert noted that American Battery’s advancement establishes the company as a significant player in the ongoing energy transition.

Other major players, including Lithium Americas and Albemarle, have also made headlines in recent months for similar U.S.-based projects, but American Battery’s speed and visibility have drawn particular attention from both institutional and retail investors.

Next Steps for Tonopah Flats

Now that baseline studies are complete, the company will proceed to the formal environmental review and public comment phase — steps that could determine the project’s long-term timeline.

While still early in development, American Battery’s leadership remains confident.The company explained that its operations at Tonopah Flats extend far beyond traditional mining activities, emphasizing that the work encompasses innovation, sustainability practices, and the development of energy independence for the nation.

For investors, the next few months may prove decisive. Analysts suggest that a smooth regulatory process could open the door to partnerships, financing, or even early offtake agreements with battery manufacturers.

Wind continues to be the largest source of renewable energy in Michigan, accounting for 67% of renewable generation.
Solar generation continues to grow rapidly in Michigan, accounting for 18% of renewable generation in 2023, the report found.
Even so, that deep red MAGA support hasn’t slowed the state’s move to embrace renewable energy and microgrids on multiple levels.","Renewable energy support at the federal level may be facing an aggressive backlash from the Trump Administration, but several large states—some of which helped elect the president—are still embracing solar, wind and energy storage.

California, Michigan and Texas recently touted their major expansions in alternative energy projects. These come despite moves by the Trump Administration to end federal tax incentives for clean energy projects and terminate previously approved funding for renewable, carbon capture and other decarbonization works.

The renewable energy drive in California is hardly a surprise, but the scope of funding remains impressive.

“While Trump bets on the past, California is building the future,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement within the report by the California Energy Commission (CEC). “Regressive energy policy may play well on Fox News, but it’s plain bad economics. Today it costs more to run a dirty fossil fuel power plant than to build a brand-new clean energy facility.

“The markets know where the future is headed — and so do we,” the California governor added. “Clean, green, reliable power—that’s California’s bet, and we’re already winning it.”

Last week, the CEC approved $136 million new decarbonizing energy and climate technology investments. The state is first nationwide in solar installations and working on other projects involving utility-scale battery storage, hydrogen and microgrids.

California, of course, is among the bluest of blue states and rejected Trump three times in presidential elections. Michigan, however, is more reddish purple and voted for Trump two out of three times, in the 2016 and 2024 races.

Even so, Michigan is proving to be open to renewable and distributed energy resource programs. The state’s Public Service Commission (MPSC) has reported on the continued growth of renewable and DER projects.

The MPSC’s Status of Renewable Energy, Distributed Generation, and Legacy Net Metering in Michigan report finds that electric utilities regulated by the MPSC had more than 7,500 MW (7.5 GW) of renewable capacity at the end of 2024 and more than 8,300 MW expected by the end of 2025, based on contracts approved by the Commission. Utilities added 1,698 MW of renewable energy in 2024, an increase of 28.9% over the 5882 MW of renewable capacity that was online at the end of 2023.

That figure is expected to reach 17,800 MW by 2030 as renewable energy expands to meet the standards set in Michigan’s energy laws revamped in 2023, according to the MPSC report. The amount of renewable generation in service statewide will exceed that number because utilities not regulated by the MPSC aren’t required to submit renewable energy contracts to the Commission.

Wind continues to be the largest source of renewable energy in Michigan, accounting for 67% of renewable generation. Solar generation continues to grow rapidly in Michigan, accounting for 18% of renewable generation in 2023, the report found.

Michigan’s electric providers were required to meet a 15% renewable portfolio standard by 2021. With the passage of the revamped energy laws in 2023, electric providers are now required to meet a 50% renewable portfolio by 2030 and 60% by 2035.

Among the Michigan report’s other highlights: The generation capacity of Michigan’s distributed generation program increased to 222.4 MW in 2024 from 189.6 MW in 2023, a more than 17% increase.

Texas, meanwhile, is the reddest and red states and has resoundingly supported Trump three times. In fact, the Lone Star State hasn’t voted for a Democrat for president since Jimmy Carter in 1976.

Even so, that deep red MAGA support hasn’t slowed the state’s move to embrace renewable energy and microgrids on multiple levels. Part of this trend is driven by a desire for a diverse generation portfolio to defend the sometimes-challenged Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid from resource inadequacy and outages in the fast-growing state.

Texas is, by far, the nation’s leading installer of utility-scale wind power. Installed capacity of utility-scale battery storage also is rapidly expanding from Beaumont to El Paso and Dallas to Houston, having grown a stunning 4,100% to 5,707 MW (5.7 GW) in the previous four years.

“Excluding California, Texas has more battery storage than the rest of the United States combined, accounting for over 32% of all the capacity installed nationwide,” reads a report from the Texas State Comptroller’s Office. “Fast permitting processes and a vast amount of land—mainstays of Texas’ low regulation, business-friendly environment and the same features that have allowed wind and solar power to thrive in Texas — make it easier for developers to enter the battery storage market. Furthermore, the global price of lithium-ion batteries has plunged 82% over the past 10 years as raw material prices decreased, and demand softened more than expected.”

California still rules in solar installed capacity, but Texas is gaining fast and outpaced the Golden State last year. Solar capacity in Texas is rising beyond 45,000 MW which is getting close to 10% of the total generation resource mix within ERCOT and other Texas grid connections.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/10/68ed13855e790c3ec0569583-dreamstime_ai_us_map.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-13 13:03:43.877930

But FlowGen, a producer of small wind turbines based in Zug, Switzerland, has numerous microgrids in Europe that include wind-among them one at the Munich International Airport–and two projects underway in the US, at a telecommunications company and in a separate company’s solar fields.

Microgrid power at 6 cents/kWh to 8 cents/kWh

Company CEO Dirk Kuester said that FlowGen microgrids, which include solar, wind, energy storage–and sometimes fuel cells–can deliver subsidy-free power at 6 cents/kWh to 8 cents/kWh and commission the units within three to five months.

In the U.S., wind generation deployment achieved record highs in April 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But President Trump has tried to stamp out the technology by phasing out the Inflation Reduction Act’s investment tax credit and canceling funding for projects.

Kuester offered the Munich International Airport project as an example of why it’s a good idea to build microgrids that include wind, solar and energy storage.

How wind and solar help each other out in a microgrid

In general, wind and solar complement each other. Solar produces energy during the day, while wind is more likely to yield it at night.

“This is the best efficiency mix for microgrids,” Kuester said.

To meet the goals of its “Net Zero 2035” strategy, the Munich airport was looking for ways to provide clean, resilient power for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The airport’s challenge was meeting high electricity consumption for EV charging, lighting and ground operations with a low-footprint option. It sought a system that could generate renewable energy on site, store enough energy to ensure continuous operations and support EV charging infrastructure.

FlowGen provided a containerized microgrid that integrated wind, solar and energy storage. It includes three 15-kW FlowGen small-scale wind turbines mounted on a mobile container, 10 kW of solar PV panels installed on the roof of the container, energy storage and the infrastructure needed to charge four to six EVs a day. The system generates up to 200 kWh daily on sunny and windy days, powering EV charging stations in the car rental parking area, Kuester said.

When the EVs aren’t being driven, it’s possible to use their batteries to add storage capacity to the microgrid, he said.

Wind-based microgrids to cut diesel use for the U.K. Ministry of Defense

FlowGen is also working on a trial project with the U.K. Ministry of Defense aimed at replacing diesel generators with mobile microgrids to charge drones, Kuester said. Avoiding diesel use is important because the diesel transportation vehicles could potentially be bombed, he said.

“You can use the microgrids to charge drones anywhere, and you don’t see them or hear them,” he said.

For the military, the microgrids can also charge cybersecurity systems so they don’t experience outages.

Focusing on telecom, cell towers and large-scale energy users

In June 2021, FlowGen announced a deal granting microgrid company CleanSpark exclusive distribution rights to FlowGen’s wind turbine products in North and South America. At the time, the companies were focusing on telecom operations, cell towers and data centers. CleanSpark said that it expected about 70% of wind-powered microgrids to include solar.

FlowGen is targeting high-cost energy markets, low-cost energy markets where remote off-grid power is needed and large-scale users, according to a recent company press release. Its projects include a Norwegian test center for powering offshore oil platforms and Niedersachsen Ports, the operator of state-owned ports in Germany.

FlowGen is not alone in the wind, solar and storage microgrid space

FlowGen isn’t the only company offering microgrids that include wind power. IBIS Power, based in the Netherlands, offers a system called PowerNest — a modular unit that combines solar, wind and energy management in an architecture that can be used on building rooftops, where turbulence around the rooftop makes energy production inefficient.

The IBIS system overcomes the turbulence challenge and maximizes renewable energy production, the company said. The unit, which is placed on a building’s roof, has internal wind turbines and solar panels on the top. PowerNest works to remove the turbulence around a building by capturing the wind, then bending it inward, accelerating it and guiding it through the wind turbine.

Bergey Windpower focuses on off-grid hybrid microgrids as a way to reduce the use of diesel, increase renewable energy deployment and cut wear and tear on batteries.

California-based Air Voltaics offers small to midsize wind turbines for microgrids and says that wind turbines require less space than solar panels. Together with solar panels, they create a more reliable energy supply, according to the company.

FlowGen has its eye on the U.S. market, Kuester said.

“We see the U.S. market as the biggest market as energy demand reaches its targets,” he said.","https://img.microgridknowledge.com/files/base/ebm/microgridknowledge/image/2025/10/68ed168b39bfa5643600a0cc-flowgen_munich_airport_2.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-13 12:06:21.587533

Farmers Branch-based Centurion American Development Group has long been known as one of North Texas’ finest and most prolific developers of quality residential communities. The company has announced the acquisition of Rio Claro, a new large-scale residential development in Fort Worth. The transaction closed on Friday, Oct. 3. Located southeast of Morris Dido Newark Road and Bonds Ranch Road, the 629.4-acre community will be developed in four phases and feature approximately 1,761 single-family home sites. Residents will enjoy access to expansive open space, walking trails and a modern amenity center, fostering a strong sense of community and connection to the outdoors with close proximity to Eagle Mountain Lake and its recreational marinas and amenities.

“Fort Worth continues to be one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, and the demand for thoughtfully planned communities has never been greater,” said Mehrdad Moayedi, president and CEO of Centurion American Development Group. “With Rio Claro, we are proud to bring a new neighborhood that balances high-quality homes with the natural beauty of the area, creating a place where families can thrive for generations to come. We relish the relationship we have with the City of Fort Worth and really respect the level of engagement and partnership they bring to the table.”

Centurion American has curated and secured some of the areas top builders to bring this community to fruition with a variety of lot sizes ranging from 50-feet to 80-feet. These include Coventry Homes, DR Horton, First Texas Homes and HistoryMaker Homes. Centurion American’s leadership sees this and other North Fort Worth developments as being key in addressing the rapid growth in lucrative careers in that corridor.

“The excellence and diversity of design represented by these builders ensures that Rio Claro residents will enjoy an exceptional quality of living and a beautiful neighborhood,” Moayedi said. “The community benefits from the adjacent $270 million Eagle Mountain High School, the newest campus in the award-winning Eagle Mountain-Saginaw ISD.”

In addition to creating high-quality homes, Centurion American is deeply committed to supporting the region’s long-term mobility and infrastructure needs. As part of the Rio Claro development, the company is working closely with the City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, and local transportation authorities to enhance area roadways, improve traffic flow, and strengthen key connections that serve the broader North Fort Worth corridor. This collaborative approach reflects Centurion American’s belief that responsible growth requires thoughtful investment not only within the community but also in the infrastructure that connects residents to schools, jobs, and amenities throughout the region.

Funding for the Rio Claro development was provided by IBC Bank. The deal was acquired from PMB Capital. “Matt Mildren and his team at PMB Capital have been great partners in bringing this deal to fruition,” said Moayedi.

Rio Claro joins other Centurion American residential communities, including the adjacent Estates at Eagle Mountain located at the northeast corner of Morris Dido and Bonds Ranch Road, which brings the luxurious lake lifestyle to a new generation of homeowners. The Estates at Eagle Mountain is a 836-acre development which will incorporate 1,126 large lots which run from 15,000 sf to 30,000 sf. The combined communities cover almost 1,500 acres and will be home to approximately 3,000 single-family lots. Phase One of development is expected to begin soon, with lot delivery to builders anticipated in Q1 2027.

The International Maritime Organization’s updated greenhouse gas strategy sets a net-zero ambition “by or around 2050,” with waypoints for 2030 and 2040, and an expectation that zero or near-zero fuels begin showing up in meaningful volumes by 2030. Regional policies are already operational, as is interim IMO guidance, which also locks in a well-to-wake1 view of emissions.

Multiple decarbonization pathways are advancing, through efficiency upgrades, route optimization, alternative fuels and onboard capture. But near-term progress depends on access to compliant molecules at scale, with defensible lifecycle carbon and recognized certification. Capital will back options that leverage existing assets while other technologies mature. That is where ethanol is relevant.

The U.S. operates a large, export-ready ethanol infrastructure with roughly 18 billion gallons of nameplate capacity, steady production and record exports of near 2 billion gallons last year. Plants, rail, barge and port connections exist today. That footprint can support marine supply chains now and, where needed, feed conversion processes that yield candidate blendstocks for the distillate pool.

Methanol has driven real momentum in alternative-fuel newbuilds and retrofits. Public sources indicate by mid-2024, methanol accounted for roughly 9% of the global orderbook by vessel count (about 242 ships)2. As of early 2025, around 60 methanol-fueled vessels were in operation and about 340 were on order3. Industry materials also referenced roughly 700 “methanol-ready”4 designs5. That installed base is valuable infrastructure for alcohol fuels in general, and ethanol complements it. Ethanol and methanol are both simple alcohols with similar handling and safety requirements under the IMO’s low-flashpoint rules, so the same broad tank, piping, ventilation and detection concepts apply. That platform overlap makes methanol-capable designs a logical starting point for ethanol with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) calibration and targeted material changes. On a volumetric basis, ethanol offers higher energy density, helping extend range or reduce tankage. For owners and charterers, dual-fuel optionality across both alcohols diversifies feedstock risk, broadens sourcing and strengthens the procurement stack without forcing a binary choice.

With methanol-capable platforms now common, ethanol slots in as an add-on rather than a redesign. OEMs are already running compression-ignition trials with a pilot fuel, and the same IMO low-flashpoint rules apply. The near-term fit is controllable fleets through harbor craft, inland towboats and offshore support. This is where ethanol’s ultra-low sulfur/aromatics and particulate reductions matter; the known trade-offs versus marine gasoil (materials and energy density) can be handled with selective seal/line upgrades and engine control unit recalibration, then taken through testbeds, class approval and sea trials.

Local business, civic and labor leaders see nuclear energy as the fuel of choice when Xcel Energy stops burning coal at its power plants in Pueblo County,

Is nuclear power becoming cool in Colorado?

The state has had only one nuclear power plant, Fort St. Vrain near Platteville. And it was converted to natural gas in 1989 after 10 years of technical problems. The former Rocky Flats weapons plant, which produced plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs, drew thousands of protesters for years to the site north of Denver, including such prominent activists as Daniel Ellsberg and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg.

In 2004, Colorado voters were the first in the country to approve a renewable energy mandate for utilities. How has nuclear power, with its baggage of radioactive waste and the Three Mile Island partial meltdown, become a seriously considered option in today’s fuel mix?

Worry about the demand for electricity outstripping capacity and concerns about progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions led state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Denver Democrat, to back legislation this year that defines nuclear power as “clean.” He sponsored House Bill 25-1040, which added nuclear to the energy sources that utilities can use to meet state clean energy targets.

“As a kid, I grew up in the ’80s when a lot of talk about nuclear was in relation to the weaponry that was pointed at each other between the Soviet Union and the United States,” Valdez said. “I think I just kind of lumped nuclear into the same conversations as most people do: around its negative uses, less desirable uses.”

Valdez got a different perspective when he was appointed to the nuclear working group at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The group visited France, which gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power. Roughly 19% of electricity in the U.S. comes from nuclear energy.

With some forecasts showing electricity demand rising dramatically, Valdez said the U.S. will have to add “a tremendous amount of energy” to the grid if it’s going to compete in quantum computing and other advanced technology.

A boom in data center construction driven by increasing the use of artificial intelligence is expected to escalate the need for more electricity generation.

Valdez, who spent most of his career in the renewable energy field, said the legislation he sponsored recognizes that the power generated by nuclear energy is carbon-free. “As we move toward our path to zero-carbon (energy), it can be included in the mix to get us there.”

Not ready for prime time

A lot of the current interest in nuclear power revolves around a new technology: small modular nuclear reactors, about one-tenth to one quarter the size of a conventional reactor. They’re billed as potentially less expensive, safer, easier to build and adaptable because modules can be added as more power is needed.

The technology is also still in the development and demonstration stage. Just a few are operating in China and Russia. No small modular reactors –SMRs– are in commercial use in the U.S.

“SMRs aren’t ready for prime time,” said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “You will hear from developers and others about the advantages. The advantages right now are all on paper.”

The institute focuses on research into the economics of expanding the use of renewable energy.

“We are not fans of nuclear power because it costs too much and that cost has been consistently high over the years. We see no track record of it declining,” Wamsted said. “We certainly don’t see that happening with a new class of reactor that nobody’s built before and nobody’s run before.”

Noah Rott, a spokesman for the western region of the Sierra Club, said the environmental group feels that discussion around nuclear energy “is largely a distraction as utilities work to address electric load growth in the next decade.”

“Cleaner sources like wind, solar, demand response, energy efficiency and storage are the answer here,” Rott said in an email.

However, the concept of an energy source that can run 24/7 and emit no heat-trapping greenhouse gases when generating power is compelling. Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in August that the airport, the country’s third-busiest, planned to commission a study to explore the feasibility of building a small, modular nuclear reactor on its campus to meet the growing demand for electricity in the area and cut the use of carbon-emitting power.

The airport put the study on hold after complaints that city officials hadn’t talked to area residents first. The airport determined that a broader scope will best serve its interests and needs and will issue a request for information later this fall on multiple clean energy solutions, including reactors, after first receiving ideas and input from the community, spokeswoman Courtney Law said in an email Wednesday.

Nuclear power generation is the top choice of a local advisory committee for replacing coal at Xcel Energy’s Comanche power plants near Pueblo. Xcel has proposed tapping renewable energy, battery storage and natural gas when it stops burning coal by 2031.

But the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, established by Xcel and community members, said renewable energy facilities wouldn’t provide the same number of jobs and tax revenue for local governments that nuclear or gas facilities would. The committee is promoting installing SMRs.

Xcel Energy operates nuclear facilities in Minnesota and has said they’re not off the table for Colorado, but the new type of reactors likely won’t be commercially available when the utility has to replace its coal plants.

The Western Governors Association, WGA, held workshops in September at the Idaho National Laboratory, which focuses largely on nuclear energy.

The workshops were part of an initiative by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West.” Cox, the WGA’s chairman this year, said the country is looking to the West for ways to meet the surge in need for more electricity.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little said during a workshop that the U.S. won’t meet its energy needs “with our legacy energy.”

“We’re going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy,” Little said.

While it could be five to 10 years before small reactors are up and running in the U.S., Mark Jensen, a chemistry professor at the Colorado School of Mines, said the federal government is more involved in promoting nuclear energy than in the recent past. He noted that the Department of Energy has opened federal sites to allow companies to test prototypes and that could help streamline development.

President Donald Trump has issued executive orders intended to invigorate the nuclear power industry and streamline regulations.

Jensen, director of the nuclear science and engineering program at the School of Mines, said more private money is flowing into nuclear projects than he has seen over the past 35 years.

Wind, solar the ‘workhorses’

Jack Waldorf, WGA executive director, said in an email that advancements in nuclear energy provide the opportunity to expand clean, reliable generation of electricity, but achieving true energy abundance will require a comprehensive approach.

Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that Colorado has a history as an innovator and nuclear energy should be no different. ” As projects become cost competitive and safer, we should view nuclear energy not as a competing energy source to wind and solar, but as a complementary solution for better overall reliability and lower costs.”

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, agreed. He said as Colorado moves to more deeply cut emissions, other technologies will be needed and nuclear energy should certainly be in the mix.

“It’s pretty clear that wind and solar will be the workhorses of the grid just looking at the cost modeling,” Toor said. “You can build them relatively quickly and they’re so much cheaper than other resources.”

He expects nuclear power to be in a group of what he calls “clean, firm” energy sources: ones that emit low or no greenhouse gases and provide round-the-clock power. Toor said geothermal energy is likely the furthest along among those sources.

“The challenge with nuclear is really still the same challenge that it has been for utilities, which is the cost, how long it takes to build and the uncertainties of federal permitting,” Toor said.

He added that he would be surprised if Colorado utilities moved ahead with conventional nuclear or “to be first in line for the first-of-its-kind” small modular reactor.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TDP-L-img1332A_115195150.jpg?w=1024&h=717,N,,2025-10-13 13:02:44.535929

Read the rest of the series here.

Last October, Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative needed help and the Boy Scouts came to the rescue.

One of the nation’s largest co-ops, Withlacoochee usually rides out storms with its own staff, as it did with Hurricane Helene. Twelve days later, Milton roared across its Florida territory, causing monumental flooding and damage, and the co-op finalized a tent city to house hundreds of outside lineworkers. But the night before operations kicked in, the base camp contractor informed Withlacoochee that it would be unable to feed the crews breakfast a few hours later.

Enter the Boy Scouts and their encampment at Spring Hill, 30 miles northwest of the co-op’s Dade City headquarters. From stores near and far, Withlacoochee bought food to nourish 600 men. Overnight, employees, community members, and Ranger Daniel Tremblay and his wife stepped in to help. On the morning of Oct. 10, breakfast was served.

“Out of the Boy Scouts kitchen, we started feeding. They came in, cooked and helped us feed when we didn’t have any other help,” said David Lambert, executive vice president and general manager at Withlacoochee. “We’d long supported scouting and supported their mission. Never in my lifetime did I think we would need to use their facilities as a base camp to help us.”

Partnerships between co-ops and their communities are essential components of power restoration and even more so when one of the worst storms ever to hit you is immediately followed by the worst.

Warm-up hurricanes

In September and October, Helene and Milton delivered a one-two punch to Withlacoochee, which serves about 270,000 members across five central Florida counties—and add Debby in early August to make it a one-two-three blow.

“It was unimaginable, let’s just put it that way,” Lambert said. “We had just come off of Debby and that caused a little bit of coastal flooding, primarily in our farthest north county, Citrus. Then, a month later, we had Hurricane Helene and it was a wall of water on the coast. Some homes had 18 feet of water in them.”

As Helene moved north and waters surged, Lambert and his staff watched from the Dade City control center as four feet of water swept into a substation on U.S. 19 near the coast. Co-op crews were on the scene almost immediately because there was no time to waste—in addition to bringing back power to 110,000 members, Helene became a matter of saving lives and property.

“When the water recedes, the clock is ticking,” said Gary Steele, manager of member relations. “You’ve got to get that drywall out. You’ve got to get that carpet up. You’ve got to get all those appliances out of the house. You’ve got to get it dry so you lose as little as possible.”

With a Herculean effort, Withlacoochee had almost all lines repaired within 48 hours. However, officials in one county wouldn’t let the co-op flip the switch to damaged homes until they passed an electrical inspection. Knowing electricity was essential to the drying process, Withlacoochee got thousands of meters ready to roll as soon as it got the go-ahead and worked behind the scenes to expedite the process.

“We would have that account back up as soon as we got the release [from the county] because we knew that people were literally standing outside those homes with all their belongings, their toothbrush, their TV and every ounce of clothes they had on the curb,” Steele said. “They had fans and were waiting on power to turn on those fans and dry the two-by-fours in the house.”

On its social media sites and in interviews, Withlacoochee established itself as a go-to communications hub to help members and non-members navigate the procedure to get their meters spinning.

“We’re so involved in the community. We believe we are the No. 1 trusted partner in our community,” Lambert said. “We build strong communities. Anybody can provide electricity. We build strong communities. That’s our whole philosophy.”

Milton tested that philosophy.

One-of-a-kind storm

Withlacoochee felt so confident about post-Helene repairs that it prepared to send crews to Georgia co-ops still staggered by the Category 4 hurricane. Lambert headed to an NRECA Regional Meeting in South Carolina and got as far as Jacksonville when his phone sounded an alert.

What was thought to be a tropical storm was turning into something much worse. Milton rapidly strengthened on Oct. 7, becoming one of the most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record with winds of 180 mph. Lambert made a U-turn and, by 11 a.m., was sitting with Steele and staff members calling contractors and arranging for support.

“By that night, the reports were that it was going to be a Category 3 or 4,” Steele said. “It kept getting worse and worse as the hours ticked by and it was amazing how quickly a storm that was supposed to be nothing more than just a little bit of wind and rain turned into the worst storm we’ve ever seen.”

From the control center, they had watched Helene flood coastal communities. On Oct. 9, Milton, now a Category 3, flooded them. The Dade City control center is underground, a little like a bomb shelter. Water started pouring through the bottom floor. The staff tried to keep one eye on the cameras while catching water in buckets. Tree after tree fell outside the corporate office. Staffers sawed their way to freedom.

“The water damage was so bad that we lost all communications to all of our substations and we have our own fiber network,” Lambert said. “This office used to be covered in gigantic oak trees. You hardly see any here. We couldn’t even get out of the building. It was that bad.”

The scene at the control center was repeated time and again across Withlacoochee’s service area, wind and water damage on a scale unseen in its 78-year history. Almost 204,000 members were without power. At one point, Milton spawned an estimated 26 tornados in the territory.

But Helene came first, and co-ops from Georgia to Kentucky were still soaking up all available manpower and resources. In 2023, when Lambert took over as general manager, he started to review and add contracts for storm assistance as a measure of security. “We had 15 storm contracts. We started calling every single one of those folks because we knew Milton was coming in. We got to the eighth storm contract before anybody would even pick up the phone.”

That’s when partnerships came into play. For the first time, Withlacoochee couldn’t handle a storm on its own. Lambert called Katherine Domingue, CEO and general manager at SLEMCO in Lafayette, Louisiana. Within hours, a team of 30 SLEMCO lineworkers was on its way, escorted onto the highway by the Louisiana State Police. “It was probably one of the biggest reliefs we had had when Katherine picked up the phone at SLEMCO and said, ‘Absolutely, we’ll send you help,’” Lambert said.

Crews from Central City-based DEMCO, which abuts SLEMCO, and co-ops in Texas and Arkansas soon followed. In all, about 2,000 lineworkers and related personnel were on the ground at Withlacoochee. “I get goose bumps about it because we love and appreciate all the crews that came to help,” Lambert added.

The challenge they faced was stunning. Crews chopped through 200-year-old oak trees and waded through waist-high water just to get downed wires. Contractors from as far away as California and Canada supplemented crews from Withlacoochee and other co-ops. Restoration required specialized equipment from contractors in Georgia.

“One piece of equipment would get stuck and they would be bringing another one right behind it with winches to get it out. Then we would have to bring in track dozers to get even further into certain areas,” Lambert said.

A video of DEMCO crews went viral worldwide. Three lineworkers are up to their chests in water in what used to be a neighborhood when another suddenly surfaces, drenched but clutching the piece of cable for which he dove underwater.

“We knew it was going to be bad, but we never dreamed it was going to be as bad as it was. But we also never dreamed that we would be 95% restored in 70 hours, too,” said Lambert, adding that 100,000 members were back online within about 24 hours, thanks to skilled workers, multiple backfeeds and the Boy Scouts.

Tremblay and the Boy Scouts eagerly answered the call when Withlacoochee reached out about using their land and facilities as a makeshift camp for hundreds of lineworkers. Again, a relationship with meaning, Lambert noted, a reversal of roles from Withlacoochee’s long-term financial and resource support of Scouting America and the youth community.

After all, if incoming crews to Withlacoochee were not greeted with food and a welcoming attitude, things could have turned out differently, he said.

“Part of that is feeding them breakfast, relying on those relationships and getting those 600 people in the community on day one. That made a huge, huge, impact on our restoration. At a minimum, had we delayed those crews and got them later, that’s one more day our folks would have been without power.”

The forever flood

The hurricane had passed, but the nightmare was just beginning. Shamonique Simmons is part of the accounting department at Withlacoochee, where she started as a customer service representative 15 years ago. Simmons left her three-bedroom house in the Ridge Manor section of Hernando County to go to work on a Friday morning, 10 days post-Milton.

She would not see her house again for a month. Her neighborhood of 100 homes is surrounded by lakes that flooded over ridges and contours as the Green Swamp in central Florida drained the excess rain from Milton, feeding rivers and streams. Though her home was about 200 feet from a lake, three to four feet of water gushed into her property and washed away her world.

“I almost cried,” she said of the first time she was allowed to return to the property. “I had to hold it together, though. It was sad.” Simmons stayed with relatives; friends helped her trash everything and then worked on rebuilding this summer.

Gloria Blankenship, a soothing voice on the member services line for 24 years, lives in the same Lakewood subdivision, about a mile from the nearest lake. She was in her one-story house for 23 years until the remnants of Milton, 10 days later, kicked out her and her husband.

A friend displaced by the storm was staying with the Blankenships, who thought their home was on secure ground. As water rose, the friend called her—you need to get home; the water is rising.

“It’s never flooded in that area since I’ve been there. As soon as I started seeing it happen, I was a little in shock and so was that part of the neighborhood,” she said. “All I could think of is, ‘What do I need to grab and just get out of here?’” Blankenship said.

She considers herself fortunate because she retrieved some items and took on nine to 14 inches of water, less than some other residences. “You go through phases of rollercoaster rides. You’re like, ‘OK, I’ve got this, we’re almost there.’ And then you miss your house or miss being home,” said Blankenship, who moved into a travel trailer on her brother’s property before starting the process of rebuilding.

Their work helped them ease at least a little of the pain. “Working was the only thing that kept me really sane,” Simmons said. To Blankenship, going to the office helped take her mind off the situation. “Everybody is good about asking, ‘How are you doing, Gloria? How is it coming along?’ I love it here. I love this company.”

Simmons and Blankenship were two among many Withlacoochee staffers touched by the flood. One board member had six feet of water in his coastal home, Lambert noted. The co-op cut and cleared fallen trees so some of its employees could get to work.

“We’ve got a culture where we take care of our community. We take care of our employees because they’re like our family. Even though we have right at 600 employees, we are still a family. We’re not so big that we can’t take care of one another and then that hopefully is reflected in our relationships with our members,” Lambert said.

Storm-related costs for the double whammy of Helene and Milton totaled about $49 million, Lambert said, noting that the tab would have been even higher absent some of the system storm hardening Withlacoochee has undertaken in recent years. This summer, Withlacoochee has been part of hurricane expos and presentations designed to keep preparation on the top of the minds of its members.

“We’re really pushing the message for folks to be prepared, tell your neighbors to be prepared, know the things they can do to prepare and where they can get help because we know from Milton and Helene that they are going to need it,” Steele said.

“Be prepared” is the motto of the Boy Scouts and a value at Withlacoochee. On Nov. 1, nearly three weeks to the day after Milton struck, Withlacoochee hosted a breakfast fundraiser for one of its partners, an annual event that had been postponed because of Milton. It raised $25,000 for the Boy Scouts of America Withlacoochee District.

Wisconsin Examiner

This story was originally published on Wisconsin Examiner.

More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.

The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.

“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.

The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.

Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.

“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”

Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.

“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”

Battery power and rural grid upgrade

The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.

The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”

The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.

The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”

Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.

The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.

Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.

The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.

Energy efficiency and innovation

Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.

“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.

Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.

Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.

Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.

The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.

If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.

A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.

“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”

Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.

‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program

A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.

“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”

Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out.

Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.

“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”

WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.

If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/07/energy_dome_alliant_energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 16:02:45.782763

“The bigger danger for the Detroit Three is they’re no longer global manufacturers, they’ve been chased back to North America and China seems to be ... quickly moving people onto their (battery electric vehicles).","Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. trail other major car markets where General Motors does business, which was not expected to be the case when GM first planned its broad EV portfolio.

Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM's leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

Duncan Aldred may be the one automotive executive not sweating over the anticipated slowdown of the U.S. electric vehicle market.

Aldred, GM’s senior vice president and president of North America, is in a critical position: leading GM’s most profitable but challenging markets.

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. trail other major car markets where the global company does business, which was not expected to be the case when GM first planned its broad EV portfolio. Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra said onstage at an industry event that “up until a year ago, we were on a journey to a regulatory environment where we had to drive EVs.”

Still, GM invested significant money and planning to offer the range of EVs it has today. Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM's leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

“We believe EVs will remain a strong part of the GM portfolio. Quite honestly, it’s one of the reasons why our market share has grown so much this year,” Aldred said. “It’s not something (we), in any way, shape or form, expect to give up.”

Year to date, GM estimates that its 17.2% market share across vehicle propulsion systems is the highest it's been in 10 years. So far this year, EV total sales more than doubled to 144,668 vehicles.

GM's public pledge to produce only electric vehicles by 2035 — put forth before President Donald Trump’s first administration amid a stricter regulatory environment for climate protections — has largely been scrapped.

Congress passed a bill ending the tax credit offered to electric car buyers of up to $7,500 on the purchase of qualifying new vehicles and $4,000 on qualifying used EVs on Sept. 30, years before its original expiration.

Ford and General Motors have since said they will extend some incentive programs through leases until year-end to transition away from government support, but GM backed outof that program after concerns were raised about it by U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy. Ford also has backtracked.

In the 10 years since GM developed its strategy to develop a full portfolio of EVs, seismic issues repeatedly roiled the industry and put strain on the company’s capital.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said at a media event Sept. 30 that GM's dominance in the EV sales space is largely due to the range of vehicles GM offers.

“We've been No. 2 to Tesla for three years now. I think GM is passing us now, which is good for them, but I think we have three models, they have like 12 models,” Farley said. “So I would hope based on their investment that they would start to really accelerate that.”

A step forward, then a step back

Still, a smaller-than-predicted EV market has caused the company to make several expensive decisions to align operations with realistic vehicle sales. GM has made numerous production changes this year that reversed work that cost the company years and billions in investment converting plants to produce electric vehicles and left UAW workers in a state of confusion.

GM has slashed shifts and laid off hundreds of workers at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit-Hamtramck where it invested $2.2 billion to produce the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV; Chevrolet Silverado EV; GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Those workers will remain on layoff for the rest of the year, GM confirmed Oct. 9.

Late last month, GM changed the status of 900 workers on temporary layoff to “indefinite” layoff at the Fairfax Assembly plant in Kanas City, Kansas, while it retools the plant for production of the gas-powered Equinox.

Dontay Wilson, president of UAW Local 31, referred to the displacement of those workers as “not an ideal situation.”

“I understand the business is the business, but it would have been great to maintain some security for these folks for the foreseeable future,” he told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network. “The GM Fairfax local management team has done a decent job, but from a top-down approach, it has been surprising at times. For us, we have been doing the best we can to roll with the punches.”

GM said in April that the Toledo (Ohio) Propulsions Systems plant, which produces transmissions for the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, would increase output as it reduces electric drive unit production.

But last month, as a local television station first reported, GM told workers that it would remove the equipment to even produce electric drive units at the site, the local union leader confirmed to the Detroit Free Press — equipment GM said it spent $760 million in 2022 to install.

Toledo Propulsion Systems was GM’s first U.S. powertrain or propulsion-related factory transformed for EV-related production.

About 1,520 GM employees work at the plant, according to the company’s website. Though no plant jobs were lost, just reallocated, the move still came as a blow, according to UAW Local 14 President Tony Totty.

“Just a couple of months ago, we had an EV ride and drive, and our members were excited,” Totty said in an Oct. 2 interview. “This is a punch to the gut. Our members were excited to make these things.”

Those electric drivetrains were destined for GM’s Orion Assembly Plant, for which GM received $480 million in grant funds from the state of Michigan to expand for electric vehicle production. On July 15, the company solidified plans to produce the Cadillac Escalade, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups there.

For buyers, extra money dries up

GM’s strategy of crafting electrified options for its most popular models like the Chevrolet Blazer, Equinox and Silverado directly addressed what consumers wanted from the automaker’s emerging offerings, said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds' consumer insights analyst.

“Any flavor of EV that they want, you can get it at GM,” he said. “When you have that much choice in your lineup, it becomes easier to move customers into electric.”

No matter how desirable the product, hefty price tags and a lack of charging infrastructure present a challenge for dealers when pitching the vehicles to their customers.

The EV tax credit has been in place since 2008, so James Fackler, executive vice president of the Michigan Auto Dealers Association, said he understands why GM would want to continue the support consumers expect in showrooms.

“I can see the concern that these sales will dry up. People expect this money, and if it’s not there, will they continue to come?” he said. “There are many dealers that support the EV model. Like every salesperson, they want to give the customer what the customer wants, to check every box. A vehicle is a very expensive purchase, even used.”

What the future holds

When GM promised the delivery of an all-electric vehicle portfolio, it envisioned a market capable of supporting those sales. Since that has not come to pass, the company is looking to protect the sale of vehicles that it knows will be profitable — internal combustion vehicles.

So GM has supported the Trump administration's efforts to defang clean air regulation. One example is when GM applauded the Trump administration when it signed a congressional resolution in June reversing a waiver California and other states had been granted that would let them ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.

GM and other automakers have long argued that California and the other states should not have been allowed to do that, effectively getting to decide what kind of cars and trucks they have to make for the whole country.

The White House shared what General Motors said after reversing the waiver: ""We appreciate the actions taken by President Trump to sign (the resolution) into law and help align emissions standards with today’s market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist and senior director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, also noted the industry welcomed Trump’s interventions in the industry surrounding clean air.

“In terms of the vehicle market, this may be a blessing in disguise for automakers by having fewer sticks swung at them in terms of EV mandates — they will be freed up in the longer term to produce the vehicles people want and can afford,” Chesbrough said.

“Everybody is in shock right now trying to figure out what is the best strategy going forward,” he said. “The bigger danger for the Detroit Three is they’re no longer global manufacturers, they’ve been chased back to North America and China seems to be ... quickly moving people onto their (battery electric vehicles). Will we be able to make a competitive electric product, or will this be something we have ceded to the Chinese market?”

'No need' for discounting

With GM facing increased tariff costs and stripped of government tax incentives, Aldred’s goal to maintain EV sales momentum without excessive discounting is ambitious.

Despite those challenges, Aldred said he plans to hold firm to GM’s playbook that allowed the company to gain market share even when the competition accelerated incentives, or discounts. Earlier this year, several automakers adjusted pricing strategies ahead of Trump's first round of tariffs on foreign-made vehicles and parts. GM was the only Detroit-based automaker that did not run any ads about its U.S. commitment or lowering costs.

Also GM on Oct. 9 showed off its newest EV, a new Chevrolet Bolt, the automaker's most affordable electric vehicle, and said it plans to begin shipping them to dealerships in January. But the Detroit automaker said the vehicle would sell for only a “limited run” and would not clarify to reporters what that meant.

Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis for AutoPacific, said bringing back the Bolt corrected one of Mary Barra's rare missteps ― retiring the most attainable long-range EV just as affordability became the biggest barrier to selling electric cars.

“There's still a chicken-and-egg dilemma: Affordable EVs need volume to survive, but volume won't come without affordable EVs,” Waatti said. “GM, perhaps more than any other automaker, is uniquely positioned to tackle that tension with its strong ICE portfolio that gives it the flexibility to support EV accessibility ― even if that means at a loss ― while its long-term EV strategy takes shape.”

Though GM will remain “competitive” with its incentives moving forward, the company’s plan, Aldred said, is to more or less let the vehicles speak for themselves.

One method? Maintaining low inventory levels of desirable products to bolster dealership profitability, which in turn ensures the automaker doesn't require high incentives to sell cars.

“We won't be changing that formula. Going into next year, we started off looking at the industry ... what might happen, what will the other brands do, what will the incentive landscape be?” Aldred said. “In the end, we kind of said, 'Well, let's just look at ourselves.' Because really, what the adoption is and what other people do is somewhat irrelevant. We've got an outstanding portfolio of EVs as well as (internal combustion engine vehicles), and we believe we can sell a volume of those irrespective of what's going to happen in the bigger marketplace.”

Louisville’s industrial market stands out as a steady force, resisting the fluctuations often seen in surrounding Midwest cities such as Cincinnati, Columbus and St. Louis. Midyear figures show Louisville’s year-over-year rent growth exceeding the national percentage and its vacancy rate 340 basis points below the national rate, both signs of a healthy market.

Additionally, Louisville’s recognition in national trade publications and recent announcements of General Electric/Haier and Ford’s electric vehicle (EV) investment at its Louisville Assembly Plant suggests positive future job growth.

A sturdy foundation

Louisville’s centralized location has helped secure its place as a major logistical powerhouse and develop relationships with major industrial business players such as UPS, Ford and General Electric. UPS announced its first expansion into Louisville in 1981 and has continued to grow its operations since, including the recently opened $100 million automated medical labs shipping facility.

Ford also continues to invest in Louisville, recently leasing a 567,433-square-foot facility in Southern Indiana and a 426,300-square-foot facility in Louisville’s Bullitt County submarket just south of Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Additionally, General Electric/Haier will move washer/dryer manufacturing processes to Louisville, creating 800 new jobs and confirming Haier’s Louisville manufacturing operations as its global hub.

A resilient market

High material costs, labor shortages, rising insurance premiums, tariffs and elevated interest rates have been topics of concern over the past several years, hindering new development as well as burdening current occupiers. While Louisville hasn’t been immune to these challenges, the economic impact has been muted compared to surrounding cities.

As of the second quarter, Louisville stands at a 3.7 percent vacancy rate, beating out the national industrial vacancy rate at 7.1 percent, as well as Cincinnati (5.8 percent), Columbus (8.2 percent), Indianapolis (10.4 percent) and Nashville (4.5 percent). Asking rent growth at the end of 2024 landed at 4.6 percent year-over-year, 200 basis points higher than the U.S. growth rate of 2.6 percent.

Year-end leasing activity and absorption figures of Louisville and five Midwest cities (Cincinnati, Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, and St. Louis) from 2020 to 2024 show a range of volatility, with each city at some point outperforming the others. Averages of leasing activity and absorption figures in that five-year time period, however, show that Louisville performs competitively to its bigger Midwest counterparts, with the market outperforming all but Indianapolis in absorption and leasing activity.

While the industrial real estate market faces economic headwinds, Louisville continues to showcase steady and healthy market activity that reflects continued market interest with tenant demand competing with limited speculative availability.

Inventory growth

Markets that boast about having high inventory growth numbers usually have to face the downside of large negative absorption numbers and high vacancies during dips in the economy. Louisville’s slow but deliberate inventory growth has created a buffer to the current nationwide trends of elevated vacancy rates, conservative tenant demand and slowing new construction. Limited speculative availability and shovel-ready land have kept vacancy rates low and asking rates competitive.

So far, construction completions for 2025 stand at 1 million square feet of new supply, a slower first half than anticipated. The construction pipeline at the end of the second quarter, however, tallied at 6.4 million square feet of total bulk (buildings 100,000 square feet and over) under construction. Since the end of the quarter, an additional 1.6 million square feet has started construction, totaling 8.1 million square feet of product under construction.

With an equally healthy number of planned buildings in the pipeline, the future supply for Louisville appears healthy and measured. Currently, we are still expecting new bulk deliveries to be twice the amount in 2025 compared to 2024, which will contribute to a temporary rise in the vacancy rate.

What’s next?

More and more investors and developers seem to be taking notice of Louisville’s industrial market, appreciating its stability and resistance to national economic factors. In 2025, Louisville has been named No. 9 in America’s Top States for Business (best cost of doing business) by CNBC, is No. 6 (nationally) in U.S. Metro for Economic Business by SiteSelection, and, according to NewKentuckyHomes.com, is No. 1 in vehicle production, air cargo by weight, EV battery production and bourbon exports.

Additionally, healthy leasing activity and absorption combined with a low vacancy rate and vigorous building activity suggest positive future growth.

While continued uncertainty and high construction costs may limit speculative construction, elsewhere, Louisville’s affordability, state and local incentives and convenient accessibility to over half of the U.S population in a day’s drive make the area appealing to developers and occupiers alike, ensuring a healthy future.

We therefore invite businesses, politicians, academics, think tanks, and all those working in the green economy or interested in doing so to join us in promoting the campaign and the workforce that will be needed for 2030 - because without labour, nothing prospers.","'Without labour nothing prospers.' - Sophocles

It may be the best part of 2,500 years since the Athenian playwright wrote those words, but as human society embarks on arguably the most challenging and consequential economic transition in history - the green industrial revolution - they are as pertinent as ever.

The route to future prosperity is increasingly obvious. McKinsey has estimated the global market opportunity presented by the net zero transition could be worth more than £1tr for UK companies by 2030. By the same date, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), has estimated the pursuit of net zero could deliver a net increase in jobs of up to 725,000 across the UK economy. And, within 20 years, it projects the path to net zero could drive down average household energy and motoring costs by up to £1,400 a year. All that, before you consider how a net zero economy should help safeguard the only habitable planet in the known universe from ecosystem collapse, and in doing dampen the risk of the spiralling inflation, infrastructure damage, and healthcare costs that would come with runaway climate change.

There may still be politicians who seek to argue otherwise, framing climate change as a ""con"" and net zero as a costly endeavour that risks destroying industry and forcing businesses and jobs abroad. Just last week Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed, without evidence, that the UK's net zero targets were ""destroying more jobs than they are creating"" as she called for the Climate Change Act and net zero targets to be scrapped.

But such claims rarely survive contact with reality. The CBI estimates that, already today, there are around 22,000 net zero businesses - spanning range of sectors from renewable energy to green finance - employing some one million people in the UK. These companies and the jobs they provide are rapidly growing, too: last year these industries grew 10 per cent - three times faster than the rest of the economy - while generating £83bn in gross value added (GVA). Moreover, they offer better paid jobs with annual average salaries £5,600 above the average UK wage, at £43,000 a year.

Make no mistake, the signals of green prosperity are already emerging in the UK. Yet as Sophocles reminds us, none of the opportunities on offer can be grasped without painstaking work - and, crucially, a workforce with the right skills and talent to deliver the infrastructure and reforms that are so urgently needed.

And there's the rub. It is well documented that the path towards a cleaner, greener, resilient, and more prosperous future presents huge engineering, financial, and policy challenges. But the net zero transition is as much a skills challenge as anything else. And it is this very human question of how to develop the skills and build the workforce required to build a net zero economy that is at risk of being dangerously overlooked.

Indeed, as the UK charts its course towards a cleaner, more prosperous future, much of the current and projected workforce is ill prepared for the journey. There are skills shortages emerging across multiple green sectors, and the pipeline of school leavers or people switching careers, including those from carbon intensive industries, is struggling to fill the gaps.

Recent research by Green Alliance has warned the UK faces a widening green skills gap across every major sector of the economy, highlighting housing, transport, and land-use as facing the most immediate shortages. The UK is crying out for more heat pump engineers, sustainable packaging designers, and carbon accountants, yet these are still seen as relatively niche skills, rather than the bread and butter of tomorrow's economy that they are soon to become.

Meanwhile, a recent study by recruitment website Indeed found more than a quarter of UK firms are facing challenges when it comes to recruiting for sustainability-related jobs, while almost half of jobseekers admit they lack the necessary qualifications or experience for working in the green economy. The situation is even more stark for young people, with recent LinkedIn data showing just one in 20 people in the 18-24 age bracket believe they have the green skills needed to enter jobs supporting the net zero transition. In the clean energy sector alone, PwC estimated that the UK may soon face a green skills gap of 200,000 jobs.

For its part, the government is preparing to launch a new Clean Energy Jobs plan to support its recently announced push to double the number of roles in the sector to 830,000 by 2030. But delivering on that target will require a huge increase in the UK's science, technology, maths, and engineering (STEM) skills base, especially given the challenges of an ageing existing workforce and the way many other industries and countries are clamouring for the same skills required by clean energy developers.

Clearly, if the UK's net zero transition comes unstuck, it will not be for a lack of job opportunities - rather, it will be the lack of trained people to do them. And this is where the bad-faith arguments of net zero sceptics risk finding leverage: because it is all very well and good creating industries capable of supporting hundreds of thousands if not millions of new job opportunities in the burgeoning net zero economy, if British workers do not have the skills or experience to fill those roles, or the support and confidence to change career.

Get it wrong, and young people seeking rewarding career opportunities and communities reliant on declining high carbon industries will once again suffer. It is easy to see how under such a scenario it would be easier to blame clean technologies and a net zero transition that failed to deliver on their promise than the failure to deliver the training opportunities that would make new green jobs a possibility. Net zero naysayers' doom-laden prophecies of de-industrialisation and jobs being exported abroad risk being proved at last partially accurate, creating the conditions for an even more intense political backlash against climate action.

To head off this risk it is vital the net zero transition delivers the jobs it has promised - and that those jobs are well paid and rewarding. Diversity and equality of opportunity matters, too, because as Climate Change Committee CEO Emma Pinchbeck argued last week, DEI isn't just ""tokenistic"" but intrinsic to designing and delivering a future that works for - and gets the most out of - everyone. ""If you want to build a future, you need everyone in the room to design that future,"" she said.

None of this will be easy. The competition for green skills is intensifying at breakneck speed. Almost every major economy in the world is now jostling for a leading role in burgeoning clean technology race, with China already streets ahead. The workers with the ability to manufacture and install heat pumps or build genuinely sustainable business models will be in hot demand.

Meanwhile, this demand will have to be met against the backdrop of the UK's ageing population, tightening restrictions on immigration, perennial challenges in developing the STEM skills base, a university funding crisis, and a fractious political battle over the UK's net zero targets. The changing labour market will also have to navigate the political, economic, and social fallout from the inevitable contraction of carbon intensive industries and the need to re-train workers to support the roll out of new clean technologies.

However, where there is challenge, there is also opportunity. The good news is every new job supported by the burgeoning green economy creates another strong advocate in their community for the transition ahead, and real world evidence of how these jobs can be hugely rewarding. There is a reason why, even despite the climate-denial and 'war' on clean energy touted by the Party's leaders Nigel Farage and Richard Tice, even some Reform UK-led councils are standing up for clean energy policies and industries: political decisions that destroy employment do not tend to be hugely popular with voters.

Every green job should be seen as a blow to scepticism and kamikaze 'business as usual' economics that are sure to feature heavily in the run up to the next election, which is now almost certain to be a de-facto referendum on net zero.

There is also a growing understanding of how to build out the green skills base, of the skills that are needed, the training and recruitment strategies that work, and the messaging that can attract more people to what is a hugely exciting and vibrant sector.

All of which is why BusinessGreen is today launching Workforce 2030, a brand-new campaign that aims to raise awareness of the looming skills crunch facing industries right across the green economy, and help advance solutions to ensure the promised employment opportunities and benefits are both capitalised on and widely shared.

Through dedicated news, analysis, case studies, and input from an array of expert voices, the campaign aims to bang the drum for ambitious policies, funding, training, and education at local, national, and corporate levels to equip the workforce of both today and tomorrow with the critical skills needed to further advance the green industrial revolution.

The collaborations enable hundreds of new charging stations across the US to accept payments from WEX users and provide WEX customers with access to an extensive EV charging network.

WEX EV’s charging network is part of a suite of commercial charging solutions designed specifically for mixed-energy fleets. The WEX EV En Route solution gives drivers access to a network of over 150,000 public charging ports across the US including EVgo, Blink Charging, EV Connect, ChargePoint, FLO, AmpUp, EvGateway, Noodoe and more. Drivers can access the charging stations via the DriverDash mobile app or a universal WEX EV RFID card under a secure closed-loop payment system.

The partnership deals follow the introduction of WEX EV Depot in April 2025, which provides simple and secure charging at private chargers when using the WEX fleet card. The company already offers its public charging En Route and At-Home solutions, and it now supports EV charging payments across depot, public and at-home charging locations.

Energy infrastructure development company Lynkwell’s WEX integration allows it to provide WEX corporate-grade payment capabilities across its multitude of station networks. Its cloud-based EV charging software platform hosts dozens of EV charging networks and manages 10,000 assets.

Revel has evolved from an electric moped-sharing and ride-hail startup into a provider of urban-focused public EV fast-charging infrastructure, particularly in dense cities like New York and San Francisco. The company operates multiple DC fast charging superhubs offering 150 kW to 320 kW ports that serve all makes of EVs.

Working with WEX allows Revel to extend the reach and convenience of its fast-charging superhubs to more fleet operators, the company said. By integrating WEX’s payment technology into its network, Revel aims to make it easier for commercial drivers to access charging in dense cities while giving fleet managers transparency and control over transactions.

Ampcontrol’s AI-powered software and energy management platform is designed to help EV fleet operators and charging hubs optimize and streamline their charging infrastructure. It connects all energy assets, EV chargers and vehicles to help customers like Revel manage load and reduce energy and peak-demand costs.

“Bringing a diverse range of CPOs into the WEX EV network marks a major step forward for fleet operators nationwide,” said Carlos Carriedo, Chief Operating Officer, Americas Payments & Mobility at WEX. “By integrating our payment processing technology and syncing transaction details and RFID numbers from charging stations across multiple providers, we’re streamlining the EV charging experience and giving organizations the data they need to make smarter, more strategic operational decisions.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_605131763.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 11:02:42.180564

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25283205200805.fQlPfEfZ7p.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.52&fp-y=0.13&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-13 11:01:55.671629

The utility had aimed to retire all of its remaining coal plants by 2035.
The plants slated for extension include the 2.24GW Belews Creek facility in Stokes County, North Carolina, which could continue operations until 2040.
Alongside delayed coal retirements, Duke intends to expand its natural gas fleet, requiring more than 100 miles of new pipeline infrastructure across North Carolina.
Duke Energy is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and owns 54.8GW of baseload and peak generation in the US.","In its latest Carolinas Resource Plan, the utility revealed that it would extend the operations of several of its coal-fired plants into the late 2030s.

Much of the increased power requirement stems from new data center and AI infrastructure, according to Duke. “Regulators have made clear that replacement generation must be online and serving customers before additional coal units can retire,” company spokesman Bill Norton said.

In the plan, Duke said that due to “increasing challenges” in maintaining grid stability, the plants would have to be extended. The utility had aimed to retire all of its remaining coal plants by 2035. The plants slated for extension include the 2.24GW Belews Creek facility in Stokes County, North Carolina, which could continue operations until 2040.

Following this, the utility has said it intends to deploy small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) at former coal sites, targeting deployment by 2037.

Alongside delayed coal retirements, Duke intends to expand its natural gas fleet, requiring more than 100 miles of new pipeline infrastructure across North Carolina. While thermal generation has received a boost, the utility also reported its intention to scale back renewable targets, with projected solar additions dropping from 8.2GW by 2031 to 7.9GW by 2033, while onshore and offshore wind, which was previously forecast to add 3.6GW within ten years, has now been excluded until at least 2040.

The updated roadmap closely follows notable changes in state and federal energy policy. Last month, the US Department of Energy indicated that it was prepared to utilize emergency powers to extend the lifespan of coal-fired power plants.

The statements are a continuation of a pro-coal policy first announced by President Trump in April, when he signed a series of executive orders to “reinvigorate” the country’s coal sector to meet the surging energy demand of AI data centers.

The orders included edicts to “remove federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation.”

Several utilities have already extended the life of coal-fired plants this year, citing data center demand as a major driver. A recent example is Southern Company, which in February announced its intention to extend the life of three plants with a combined capacity of 8.2GW from 2028 to 2035.

Duke Energy is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and owns 54.8GW of baseload and peak generation in the US. It serves 8.4 million customers across six US states, including Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, North and, South Carolina, and Florida.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase launched a $1.5 trillion plan on Monday to facilitate, finance and invest in industries deemed critical to the U.S. national security and economic resilience, including defense, energy and advanced manufacturing.

As part of the 10-year initiative, the largest U.S. lender also plans to hire more bankers and invest up to $10 billion into U.S. companies through direct equity and venture capital investments, focusing on fast-growing businesses and key manufacturers.

The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration looks to modernize infrastructure and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, clean energy and rare earths.

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said.

Trump revived the trade war against Beijing on Friday, ending an uneasy truce between the two largest economies with promises to sharply hike tariffs in a reprisal against China curbing its rare earths exports.

JPMorgan said its new “security and resiliency initiative” would facilitate financing and investment across four strategic sectors: supply chain and manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence; and frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

The firm said it had already planned to facilitate and finance about $1 trillion over the next decade in support of clients in these important industries, according to previously undisclosed internal figures, but it would be increasing the size by 50%.

The U.S. government is pursuing deals across up to 30 industries, involving dozens of companies deemed critical to national or economic security, Reuters reported this month.

JPMorgan, which helped put together the government’s deal with U.S. rare earths mining company MP Materials, said in a recent company podcast that the bank was working with the Trump administration to explore more such opportunities.

“We’ve had no less than 100 calls with clients to talk about the MP transaction as well as what this means for other industries,” said Andrew Castaldo, JPMorgan’s co-head of mid-cap mergers and acquisitions. “And we’ve had numerous trips down to Washington to explore those opportunities with the government.”

Dimon also emphasized the need for policy reform to accelerate progress, citing regulatory delays and workforce challenges.

“America needs more speed and investment,” he said.

KEY INVESTMENT AREAS

The four key investment areas identified by the firm have been divided into 27 sub-sectors ranging from shipbuilding and nuclear energy to nanomaterials and secure communications and will include middle-market companies as well as large corporate clients, it added.

The bank said it would establish an external advisory council composed of public and private sector leaders, in addition to hiring more bankers and investment professionals.

It will also expand thematic research on supply chain vulnerabilities and emerging technologies, leveraging its recently launched Center for Geopolitics.

AI and energy security are key tailwinds for cleaner power

Multi-speed transition is playing out, but the long-term trend is unchanged to deploy $150trn in green technologies

The global megatrends of electrification and energy security are persuading investors in the green transition to look past short-term headwinds when allocating capital, according to senior executives at Nomura Greentech’s Sustainable Leaders Summit in Salzburg, Austria.

About $150 trillion of capital is required by 2050 to fund the global energy transition and despite recent inflationary challenges and slower progress from countries such as the US, there is a great deal of optimism about investing into green technologies.

While the cost of capital for renewables has reset at a higher level amid inflationary forces – a 200bps rise since 2021 with most of that increase coming since the third quarter of 2022 – executives viewed this as a sign that speculative capital is making way for long-term investors who see the inevitability of transitioning to sustainable energy systems.

There are reasons for optimism in all major markets including Europe, China and the US.

EUROPE – ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

Europe is committed to eliminating its dependence on Russian gas via its REPowerEU plan, which is accelerating the region’s decarbonization ambitions. Imports of Russian gas dropped from 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to 52 bcm in 2024 – with the overall share of Russian gas imports falling from 45% to 19%, according to the European Commission. This intensifying focus on energy security means that the bloc continues to roll out renewable energy more quickly, with almost half (47%) of electricity in the EU now coming from renewables. Installed wind and solar capacity has increased by 58% cumulatively between 2021 and 2024.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also caused wider tremors among neighbouring countries, prompting them to prioritise defence spending in order to become more self-reliant in the event of a wider conflict. Germany has announced plans to nearly double its defence budget to €650 billion ($764 billion) over the next five years. Companies such as Fernride have spotted a trillion-dollar opportunity to create regional champions in the sphere of automated armoured vehicles in combat zones, at ports and for freight logistics on public roads. Fernride’s AI-based human-in-the-loop technology means that one driver can operate up to 50 trucks remotely to address massive shortages of commercial drivers (400k) and trained soldiers (300k).

Europe has also made considerable progress on installing electric vehicle (EV) chargers. Take Germany, - the bloc’s biggest country - where more than 145k public charge points have been installed and a forecasted slowdown in EV car sales has not materialised.

EUROPE – REGULATORY LEADER

Europe has also used its strength in regulation to encourage the adoption of green technologies across multiple sectors as illustrated by ReFuel EU, which aims to boost the supply and demand of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by increasing SAF and eSAF mandates over time. SAF is derived from hydrotreated esters and acids while eSAF is a synthetic fuel drives from renewable energy such as solar, hydro or wind.

The FuelEU Maritime Mandate is another example of EU regulation taking a leadership role to drive change. The rules set increasingly strict limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, aiming for an 80% reduction by 2050 for commercial vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports. The International Maritime Organization created its own net zero framework earlier this year encompassing a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions.

In stark contrast to these sectors and to emphasise the powerful impact of effective regulation, summit participants cited the petrochemicals industry where regulatory drivers and subsidies are in short supply. Entrenched interests are high, and an oversupply of conventional petrochemicals is keeping prices low, meaning alternatives that carry a green premium struggle to compete with incumbents selling cheaper, higher-emission products.

CHINA – A LOW CARBON INDUSTRIAL CHAMPION

China’s decades-long investment into photovoltaic (PV) technology has paved the way for more affordable solar power across the globe. China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%, more than double China’s share of global PV demand, according to the International Energy Agency.

As a result, the levelized cost of PV solar power – which includes the cost of building the plant – has declined by 88% over the past 15 years; removing green premiums has been key to mass adoption.

In addition, China’s rapid rollout of battery technology for EVs has accelerated adoption at home and abroad.

The chart below shows that more than half of China’s vehicles will be electric by 2030.

US – MARKET FORCES DRIVE CAPACITY UPGRADES

While the US renewables market is contending with political headwinds arising from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and tariffs on imports of PV panels, aging grid infrastructure and greater power demand from investments in AI data centers could offset these negative effects.

The OBBBA reduces Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar but preserves full credits for energy storage and clean firm technologies through 2033. Tariff escalations and geopolitical tensions have intensified supply chain challenges, but as a result, a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing and alternative sourcing has emerged, even across hard to decouple supply chains such as critical components for batteries and PV modules.

High growth in the US power market is projected over the next 15 years as demand continues to outpace supply due to significant growth in sectors requiring near-term power. Over the last two decades, improved energy efficiency for lighting, appliances and heating and cooling meant that the compound annual growth rate for energy demand was about 0.4% per year but the new era of AI, EV penetration and electrification of everything is set to substantially increase demand to 3.5% per year until 2040, according to McKinsey data.

Historically, energy has not been a constraint on computing; even as higher internet traffic increased data center workloads by nine times between 2010-2020, overall energy use stayed flat because of more and more efficient chips. But the AI era is set to turn that paradigm on its head, leading to a 17-64GW shortfall in peak power demand by 2030, which will likely require fast-built solar and battery storage to fill the gap.

Every US region is in need of energy infrastructure upgrades and replacements to minimize impacts of congestion and increase reliability. All three major components of the electric grid - generation, transmission and distribution - have an identified investment gap, which is projected to grow to a cumulative $197 billion by 2029, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in existing energy infrastructure. The US utility industry expects to see about a ~1.6x increase in capital expenditures into critical infrastructure over the period of 2026-2030 representing $1.3 trillion in capex from 2026-2030.

In short, executives increasingly see a-multi-speed transition playing out with China using its industrial scale to take the lead on renewables and EVs while Europe uses the stick of regulation and energy independence to advance the green transition. The US faces short term challenges, yet it has already laid strong foundations to build resilient systems for an electrified, digital future.

And other emerging Argentinian lithium companies

These players are transforming Argentina’s role from a regional resource supplier to a global leader in lithium mining and sustainable mineral extraction.

Comparative Overview Table: Top Argentinian Lithium Firms 2025

To understand Argentina’s lithium mining market in 2025, below is a detailed comparison of the largest companies shaping the country’s mineral wealth and powering the global energy transition. The following table highlights key data on production, technology, sustainability, and market share.

Innovations in Lithium Extraction & Processing

The Argentina lithium company ecosystem is being revolutionized by advancements in technological extraction methods, leading to higher efficiency and better environmental practices.

This is mainly reflected in the widespread adoption of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)—a game-changing process compared to traditional evaporation:

Traditional Evaporation: Involves pumping lithium-rich brine to the surface, then allowing the water to evaporate in large open ponds (sometimes over 12–18 months), leaving a concentrated lithium residue.

DLE Method: Utilizes advanced filters, ion-exchange resins, or sorbent materials to selectively extract lithium directly from brine—dramatically reducing water usage, land occupation, and processing times to weeks or even days.

Benefits of DLE:

Reduced water loss in arid regions highly dependent on groundwater

Increased recovery yield (as much as 90% vs. 40–60% in conventional methods)

Lower environmental impact and improved social acceptance among local communities

As of 2025, several Argentine companies are running DLE pilot projects or have integrated this into full-scale operations, with industry leaders such as Livent and Minera Exar at the forefront.

In addition to extraction, processing innovations such as automation, AI-based process control, and real-time sensor monitoring ensure that resource use is optimized and traceability is enhanced—a field where satellite-driven analytics provide even more data-driven support.

Why Extraction Innovation Matters for the Global Battery and Energy Market

Lithium forms the backbone of electric vehicle batteries, large-scale energy storage solutions, and the broader push toward clean, renewable energy technologies. By implementing DLE and advanced mineral processing methods, Argentine companies are:

Optimizing supply to global battery manufacturing hubs (Asia, Europe, North America)

Strengthening the supply chain for electric vehicles and green infrastructure

Ensuring the country’s position as a leading contributor in the shift toward sustainability

Explore how innovative satellite-driven monitoring—from platforms like Farmonaut—is transforming mining operations at scale, ensuring environmental priorities are met.

Economic Significance and Export Growth of Lithium in Argentina

The economic impact of Argentina’s lithium sector in 2025 is profound, underpinning the nation’s position as a pivotal player in the global minerals market.

Lithium exports are now among Argentina’s most valuable mineral exports, surpassing historical pillars like copper in terms of growth rate.

The sector creates thousands of jobs, supports local economic development, and drives infrastructure improvements in provinces like Salta, Jujuy, and Catamarca.

Foreign investment continues to pour in as international firms race to secure supplies in an increasingly competitive global market.

By 2025, projections show:

Over 200,000 metric tons annual production—almost triple previous years—thanks to rapid project expansion and technological advances.

16% of the world’s lithium supply coming from Argentina, solidifying its status as a global supplier.

Most of the lithium extracted in Argentina is exported to:

Asian manufacturing giants (China, South Korea, Japan)

Major European EV and battery companies

North American clean energy manufacturers

Export-driven growth not only benefits mining companies but also funds local infrastructure—from roads to energy—as the country maximizes the strategic benefits of its natural resources.

Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability Initiatives

The expansion of Argentina’s lithium mining sector has brought pressing environmental considerations to the forefront, with leading companies making sustainability a central pillar of their operations.

Water Usage: In arid salt flat regions, mining can significantly impact water tables. Brine extraction—while efficient—must be balanced with the needs of agriculture, local communities, and fragile ecosystems.

Reduced Chemical Use: Modern extraction methods (like DLE) employ fewer harmful chemicals, minimizing soil and water contamination risks.

Recycling Initiatives: Companies prioritize water recycling to minimize fresh water use and promote zero-liquid discharge where possible.

Community Partnerships: Engaging indigenous groups and local populations ensures equitable sharing of economic benefits and environmental safeguards.

Regulatory Framework: In 2025, Argentina enforces stronger environmental regulations, requiring companies to conduct Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for all projects and update compliance standards regularly.

“For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said.
“Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.” The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023.
Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp.
He said it was “looking at a range of post-2030 settings” but had no plans to include electricity in the safeguard mechanism.","Australian household energy bills will halve by 2050 as solar panels, batteries and electric cars and appliances become the norm, reducing pressure on the federal government over living costs and creating room for more climate action, a thinktank study suggests.

Modelling by the Grattan Institute finds that cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in line with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will cut average household energy costs from about $5,800 today to about $3,000.

The report says a fall of roughly this magnitude will happen under existing policies as households use less gas and petrol and more clean energy. The biggest savings are expected in gas-reliant Victoria, where the modelling suggests average annual spending on petrol, gas and electricity could fall from $6,036 to $2,767.

The report says emission cuts in the power sector are not happening fast enough and the mid-century net zero target will not be met without a policy requiring cuts in pollution from electricity.

The Grattan Institute has called on the government to consider expanding a policy applied to major industrial polluting sites – the safeguard mechanism – to include power plants. It says this would limit household energy savings compared with what would otherwise happen, but only marginally – by about 3%.

It says the safeguard mechanism is already a form of carbon pricing – language the Labor government has avoided since it lost a fraught political fight that culminated with the Coalition government under Tony Abbott abolishing a functioning carbon pricing scheme in 2014. The institute’s energy and climate change program director, Alison Reeve, said how people use energy has changed since then “and the politics of carbon pricing should change too”.

“For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said. “Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.”

The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023. It requires about 200 industrial facilities that release more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in Australia each year – including liquified natural gas plants, coalmines, smelters and factories – to reduce emission intensity by 4.9% each year until 2030.

The cuts can be made either on site or by buying carbon offsets. Companies that reduce emissions below a baseline level are also given “safeguard mechanism credits” that they can sell to polluters that do not meet their baseline.

Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp. But the scheme has been criticised for allowing unlimited use of offsets despite peer-reviewed studies suggesting they are failing to deliver what was promised.

A review of the safeguard mechanism is planned next year.

Reeve said the institute’s modelling assumed electricity companies would make direct emission cuts, and could not rely Australian carbon credits created through methods including improved nature cover.

She said a “pure” carbon tax or emissions trading scheme would be better than current policies, including the safeguard mechanism – a point also made by the longtime Labor climate and economics adviser Ross Garnaut – but Grattan had focused on what was politically achievable.

“Neither of those horses are in the race at the moment,” she said. “You can only bet on the horses that are in the race.”

Labor has faced criticism for delays in the rollout of solar and windfarms needed to meet its target of 82% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030.

Renewable energy in homes has boomed since the introduction of a battery subsidy in July. But investment in large-scale developments – particularly windfarms – has slowed, in part due to delays in planning approvals, construction of transmission links and supply chains.

The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government was focused on delivering existing policies, including an underwriting program for large solar, wind and battery developments (known as the capacity investment scheme), the $20bn “rewiring the nation” program and the battery subsidy. He said it was “looking at a range of post-2030 settings” but had no plans to include electricity in the safeguard mechanism.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f28f6c98b3b9e387536c678228873ddc263ea5/1582_0_4418_3534/master/4418.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eeb04b20ccc4fd41e56d2cbccd22c3d4",N,,2025-10-13 09:58:21.310306

The Earth has passed its first climate tipping point

A new Global Tipping Points report led by the University of Exeter warns the Earth has crossed its first catastrophic climate threshold: the irreversible decline of warm-water coral reefs. These reefs, which support a quarter of marine species and sustain the lives of hundreds of millions of people, are officially undergoing “widespread dieback” due to ocean warming. The scientists estimate reefs begin collapsing between 1°C and 1.5°C of global heating, with current warming already at 1.4°C. The report, backed by 160 scientists from 23 countries, also cautions that other critical systems, the Amazon, Antarctic ice, and ocean currents, may soon reach tipping points. The urgency for sustainable business practices and emissions cuts continues to grow as scientists discover these irreversible tipping points.

New Zealand targets 24% methane cut from livestock by 2050

New Zealand has announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions from livestock, the sector responsible for nearly half its total greenhouse gases, by up to 24% by 2050. The plan emphasizes research, technology investment, and collaboration with farmers to develop low-emission feed and breeding innovations. Agriculture remains the backbone of New Zealand’s economy, but methane from sheep and cattle has made it one of the world’s highest per-capita emitters.

Financially, Hut 8’s earnings remain volatile.
Outlook: Stability Through Strategic Execution If successful, Hut 8’s transformation could make it one of North America’s most formidable independent data-center operators, leveraging its legacy energy expertise to supply the AI economy.","Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ: HUT) emerged as one of Canada’s largest Bitcoin miners, but over the past two years, the Toronto‑listed (TSX) firm has been quietly reinventing itself as a diversified energy-infrastructure company.

Chief executive Asher Genoot argues that this “power‑first” model unlocks cheaper financing and steady cash flows by leasing capacity to both crypto miners and HPC users.

The question for investors is whether this pivot is paying off.

Expanding a Digital Infrastructure Empire

Hut 8 has been busy building. In August the company advanced 1.53 gigawatts (GW) of U.S. development projects out of exclusivity and into construction. The company’s assets include a 300 megawatt (MW) “River Bend” campus in Louisiana, a 1 GW site and a 180 MW site in Texas, and a 50 MW facility in Illinois.

Genoot says commercialization of these sites would “double” the company’s scale and push its platform above 2.55 GW of capacity across 19 sites.

Hut 8 reported Q2 2025 revenue of $41.3 million and net income of $137.5 million. The company now manages more than 1,020 MW of power capacity with another 10.8 GW in early-stage development — effectively recasting itself from a crypto miner into a digital-infrastructure developer.

Wall Street’s Take on Hut 8’s Transformation

The pivot has drawn measured approval from Wall Street analysts. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer raised his HUT price target to $36 per share (from $33) in July, citing Hut 8’s plan to double managed power capacity to 2.55 GW and its $2.4 billion liquidity. Piper Sandler and Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage with overweight ratings and targets around $33–$35, praising the energy asset portfolio and partnerships with chip‑maker Bitmain. These numbers are already out of date as Hut 8’s stock price closed above $43 last week.

Roth Capital went further, boosting HUT’s target to $60, arguing that leasing long‑term power contracts to hyperscale customers could re‑rate Hut 8 as a data‑center operator rather than a crypto miner. On average, analysts tracked by AInvest assign a “Buy” rating with a $27.82 target, even after a late‑September selloff knocked HUT shares down 7 percent. Again, the price has recovered dramatically since this price prediction.

Institutional ownership has climbed from roughly 12 percent to 55 percent since early 2025.

Still, there are a couple of reasons for caution.

Challenges: Capital, Execution, and Environmental Pushback

Enthusiasm is tempered by concerns about capital intensity and execution risk. Benchmark’s Palmer noted that while Hut 8’s balance-sheet liquidity stands near $2.4 billion, its ambitions require multi-year financing and regulatory coordination across several states — a test few miners-turned-infrastructure firms have passed.

To add, Hut 8’s proposed facilities in Louisiana and Illinois have already drawn scrutiny from local communities over water usage and electricity demand. Environmental groups in Louisiana warn that massive AI data centers could “damage our already bleak living situations and environment.” Analysts also caution that rising electricity prices and tight labor markets could delay commissioning schedules and erode expected margins.

Financially, Hut 8’s earnings remain volatile. The firm’s Q1 2025 net loss of $134 million underscored the difficulty of maintaining profitability during the transition away from pure mining. Its “asset-light” approach relies on joint-venture financing — a $200 million revolving credit facility with Two Prime and a $130 million line with Coinbase, boosting liquidity to roughly $2.4 billion when combined with its 10,000+ Bitcoin reserve — and a $1 billion at‑the‑market (ATM) equity offering that some investors view as dilutive.

But beyond the numbers, the pivot raises a broader question: can a company built for volatility master the predictability demanded by infrastructure investors?

Outlook: Stability Through Strategic Execution

If successful, Hut 8’s transformation could make it one of North America’s most formidable independent data-center operators, leveraging its legacy energy expertise to supply the AI economy. Its long-term vision — to monetize power, not coins — aligns with the structural shift toward compute-intensive workloads and decentralized energy assets.

Yet the path forward depends on “flawless execution”: securing energy permits, closing customer contracts, and balancing environmental stewardship with growth — as is the case with IREN, and Riot platforms, Hut 8’s direct competitors. Wall Street’s early optimism suggests belief in that vision — but not blind faith.

As Roth Capital’s Darren Aftahi put it, Hut 8 is evolving from a Bitcoin miner into an energy-driven infrastructure play focused on AI. Whether it can do so profitably will determine if this bold pivot truly earns its Wall Street redemption.

The state has had only one nuclear power plant, Fort St. Vrain near Platteville. And it was converted to natural gas in 1989 after 10 years of technical problems. The former Rocky Flats weapons plant, which produced plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs, drew thousands of protesters for years to the site north of Denver, including such prominent activists as Daniel Ellsberg and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg.

In 2004, Colorado voters were the first in the country to approve a renewable energy mandate for utilities. How has nuclear power, with its baggage of radioactive waste and the Three Mile Island partial meltdown, become a seriously considered option in today’s fuel mix?

Worry about the demand for electricity outstripping capacity and concerns about progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions led state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Denver Democrat, to back legislation this year that defines nuclear power as “clean.” He sponsored House Bill 25-1040, which added nuclear to the energy sources that utilities can use to meet state clean energy targets.

“As a kid, I grew up in the ’80s when a lot of talk about nuclear was in relation to the weaponry that was pointed at each other between the Soviet Union and the United States,” Valdez said. “I think I just kind of lumped nuclear into the same conversations as most people do: around its negative uses, less desirable uses.”

Valdez got a different perspective when he was appointed to the nuclear working group at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The group visited France, which gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power. Roughly 19% of electricity in the U.S. comes from nuclear energy.

With some forecasts showing electricity demand rising dramatically, Valdez said the U.S. will have to add “a tremendous amount of energy” to the grid if it’s going to compete in quantum computing and other advanced technology.

A boom in data center construction driven by increasing the use of artificial intelligence is expected to escalate the need for more electricity generation.

Valdez, who spent most of his career in the renewable energy field, said the legislation he sponsored recognizes that the power generated by nuclear energy is carbon-free. “As we move toward our path to zero-carbon (energy), it can be included in the mix to get us there.”

Not ready for prime time

A lot of the current interest in nuclear power revolves around a new technology: small modular nuclear reactors, about one-tenth to one quarter the size of a conventional reactor. They’re billed as potentially less expensive, safer, easier to build and adaptable because modules can be added as more power is needed.

The technology is also still in the development and demonstration stage. Just a few are operating in China and Russia. No small modular reactors –SMRs– are in commercial use in the U.S.

“SMRs aren’t ready for prime time,” said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “You will hear from developers and others about the advantages. The advantages right now are all on paper.”

The institute focuses on research into the economics of expanding the use of renewable energy.

“We are not fans of nuclear power because it costs too much and that cost has been consistently high over the years. We see no track record of it declining,” Wamsted said. “We certainly don’t see that happening with a new class of reactor that nobody’s built before and nobody’s run before.”

Noah Rott, a spokesman for the western region of the Sierra Club, said the environmental group feels that discussion around nuclear energy “is largely a distraction as utilities work to address electric load growth in the next decade.”

“Cleaner sources like wind, solar, demand response, energy efficiency and storage are the answer here,” Rott said in an email.

However, the concept of an energy source that can run 24/7 and emit no heat-trapping greenhouse gases when generating power is compelling. Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in August that the airport, the country’s third-busiest, planned to commission a study to explore the feasibility of building a small, modular nuclear reactor on its campus to meet the growing demand for electricity in the area and cut the use of carbon-emitting power.

The airport put the study on hold after complaints that city officials hadn’t talked to area residents first. The airport determined that a broader scope will best serve its interests and needs and will issue a request for information later this fall on multiple clean energy solutions, including reactors, after first receiving ideas and input from the community, spokeswoman Courtney Law said in an email Wednesday.

Nuclear power generation is the top choice of a local advisory committee for replacing coal at Xcel Energy’s Comanche power plants near Pueblo. Xcel has proposed tapping renewable energy, battery storage and natural gas when it stops burning coal by 2031.

But the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, established by Xcel and community members, said renewable energy facilities wouldn’t provide the same number of jobs and tax revenue for local governments that nuclear or gas facilities would. The committee is promoting installing SMRs.

Xcel Energy operates nuclear facilities in Minnesota and has said they’re not off the table for Colorado, but the new type of reactors likely won’t be commercially available when the utility has to replace its coal plants.

The Western Governors Association, WGA, held workshops in September at the Idaho National Laboratory, which focuses largely on nuclear energy.

The workshops were part of an initiative by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West.” Cox, the WGA’s chairman this year, said the country is looking to the West for ways to meet the surge in need for more electricity.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little said during a workshop that the U.S. won’t meet its energy needs “with our legacy energy.”

“We’re going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy,” Little said.

While it could be five to 10 years before small reactors are up and running in the U.S., Mark Jensen, a chemistry professor at the Colorado School of Mines, said the federal government is more involved in promoting nuclear energy than in the recent past. He noted that the Department of Energy has opened federal sites to allow companies to test prototypes and that could help streamline development.

President Donald Trump has issued executive orders intended to invigorate the nuclear power industry and streamline regulations.

Jensen, director of the nuclear science and engineering program at the School of Mines, said more private money is flowing into nuclear projects than he has seen over the past 35 years.

Wind, solar the ‘workhorses’

Jack Waldorf, WGA executive director, said in an email that advancements in nuclear energy provide the opportunity to expand clean, reliable generation of electricity, but achieving true energy abundance will require a comprehensive approach.

Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that Colorado has a history as an innovator and nuclear energy should be no different. ” As projects become cost competitive and safer, we should view nuclear energy not as a competing energy source to wind and solar, but as a complementary solution for better overall reliability and lower costs.”

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, agreed. He said as Colorado moves to more deeply cut emissions, other technologies will be needed and nuclear energy should certainly be in the mix.

“It’s pretty clear that wind and solar will be the workhorses of the grid just looking at the cost modeling,” Toor said. “You can build them relatively quickly and they’re so much cheaper than other resources.”

He expects nuclear power to be in a group of what he calls “clean, firm” energy sources: ones that emit low or no greenhouse gases and provide round-the-clock power. Toor said geothermal energy is likely the furthest along among those sources.

“The challenge with nuclear is really still the same challenge that it has been for utilities, which is the cost, how long it takes to build and the uncertainties of federal permitting,” Toor said.

He added that he would be surprised if Colorado utilities moved ahead with conventional nuclear or “to be first in line for the first-of-its-kind” small modular reactor.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TDP-L-img1332A_115195150.jpg?w=1024&h=717,N,,2025-10-13 11:02:04.921995

Donald Trump pledged to push for “American energy dominance” throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, powered by an aggressive expansion of domestic fossil fuel production. He kept that promise in his second administration while also eliminating billions of dollars in federal support for clean energy projects.

That hasn’t been good for Americans’ pocketbooks, though. Sure, a gallon of gasoline is slightly cheaper than a year ago, but that’s more than offset by higher electric power costs, with utility rates rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation. And it turns out that global demand for U.S. oil, gas and coal isn’t keeping up with worldwide sales of Chinese green energy technology.

Chinese exports of clean energy-related products this year through July total $120 billion, according to Bloomberg, using data from the U.S. Energy Department, Energy Information Administration, China’s GACC and energy researcher Ember. By comparison, the U.S. exported just $80 billion of carbon-based energy in the same period. It continues a trend seen after China’s clean energy exports totalled $180 billion in 2024, $30 billion more than the $150 billion the U.S. got selling fossil fuels around the world. The gap is likely widening–Chinese clean tech exports were worth $20.3 billion in August alone, according to Ember.

Rapid growth in renewable power demand around the world is easy to explain: it’s cheaper and can be installed faster than traditional sources of electricity. That’s why in the first half of 2025, additions of new solar and wind power were the fastest-growing source of electricity generation, overtaking coal worldwide for the first time. And in that booming market, China is by far the world’s dominant supplier. Unfortunately, Trump’s current policies and reversal of Biden-era programs ensure the U.S. will fall even farther behind.

Those now revoked tax credits helped to kick off a manufacturing boom in America, generating hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. New factories went up all over the country, making batteries, clean vehicles and energy-efficient products for businesses and homeowners. It was also bringing down energy costs for consumers. Now that momentum is reversing.

“In terms of the global arms race for clean energy jobs and investment, the U.S. went from the middle of the pack to the front basically overnight” with the Biden programs that Trump has eliminated, Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement. But the budget bill Republicans passed on a party-line vote and that Trump signed into law this summer reversed that. “Manufacturing projects are being canceled. Jobs are being lost. Utility bills are rising.”

Trump may make good on his promise of increasing carbon energy output, but it’s a resource much of the world is losing interest in.

The Big Read

A $250 Million Plan To Pull Lithium For Batteries From The Great Salt Lake

The U.S. could become a major supplier of lithium for batteries in the next few years after the Trump administration took a stake in the developer of a massive mine in Nevada. But Silicon Valley startup Lilac Solutions thinks it’s got a better idea that avoids the higher costs and environmental harms of traditional mining: extract the pricey mineral from briny water at oil fields and sites like the Great Salt Lake in Utah instead of digging it out of the ground.

Oakland-based Lilac, which has been refining its patented ion-exchange technology for lithium extraction since its founding nearly a decade ago, is raising $250 million to build its first commercial processing facility at the Great Salt Lake that could produce 5,000 metric tons of lithium per year by 2028. If all goes well, that’s just the start as the company looks to help energy companies pull lithium out of massive underground brine deposits that are often a byproduct of active oil and gas fields across the U.S., such as the Smackover Formation, the remnant of an ancient sea that stretches from Texas to Florida, according to CEO Raef Sully.

Compared to the amount of lithium that can be pulled from conventional mines, “brine is probably orders of magnitude larger,” Sully told Forbes.

Brine projects in the Smackover region that companies such as Standard Lithium, ExxonMobil and Chevron are developing promise to yield hundreds of thousands of tons of lithium annually. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated in a study last year that there could be up to 19 million tons of lithium in the Smackover in Arkansas alone. “We estimate there is enough dissolved lithium present in that region to replace U.S. imports of lithium and more,” said USGS hydrologist Katherine Knierim, the study’s principal researcher.

Hot Topic

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, co-chair of America Is All In, on state and local efforts to fight climate change

Can you elaborate on what America Is All In is doing as the federal government reverses U.S. climate policy?

First, there's no ifs about it: We're not getting the kind of work at the federal level that we need to protect our health, our wellbeing, our economy. So we are really in what I would call a pickle at this point. But having said that, there are huge opportunities out there and we're going to grab them. [Cleveland] Mayor Bibb is my colleague and so are Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker. It's about America is all in and damn it, we are all in. This federal government is not going to take away our rights and our ability to have a healthy environment and a strong economy, which is exactly the opposite of what they are doing.

America Is All In is about gathering together our mayors, our elected officials, our colleagues at the community level. It's about bringing people together with hope and opportunity. It's about forgetting what's going on in the federal government and actually doing what's right for all of us.

It's a great opportunity now. We're growing this initiative. America Is All In is really going to be about how we once again grab the opportunity of our lifetime and move forward. Regardless of what the federal government is thinking about or wants to do, we are going to take it over. We are going to work hard at the subnational level. We're going to work hard at the community level. And we're going to start building the kind of future our kids deserve. That's what America Is All In is about.

Are there some specific programs right now that you’re focused on?

We want to make sure that the Inflation Reduction Act continues to provide progress for us. One of the interesting things about it is not just that America Is All In is working domestically, but we're going to work internationally as well. Part of this is making sure people understand that we still have opportunities ahead and we have to grab those. We've lost a lot in the Inflation Reduction Act, but honestly, we have to move beyond that and understand the power of individuals and communities in this space. It's enormously important for us to have an international presence. If this president isn't interested in positioning us in a way that's going to keep us safe and healthy, then we have to do it ourselves. We just need to move forward. And the exciting thing is that we're not just expanding domestically, but internationally. We are going to be [at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference] in Belém, [Brazil].

We are going to go beyond the United States of America so that people everywhere can see us again–so they don't just look at the Trump administration–but they look at the people in the United States and recognize that we are going to keep moving forward.

There are many opportunities that we have and I think you know them and certainly Mayor Bibb knows, but there are damages that we can't avoid. We have an administration that doesn't want to agree that climate change even exists. They're cutting out our scientists at the federal level, so they can't tell the truth about what's going on in the world. And this can go on and on and on and on. But the thing that I wake up every morning and say to myself is we can't let these people take away our sense of hope and opportunity. That's exactly what they want. They want us to get so angry that you're sitting around in a dither.

But I ain't dithering around, baby. We just have to get hold of ourselves. Really, we own this place. It's our country. So I'm excited about it and there's so many things that we're going to do both domestically and internationally that are going to remind people that we have the power. It is ours to use and we're just going to go after it.

As a result, Tesla's new cheaper models are still around $2,000 more expensive than what the flagship versions would have cost had the $7,500 EV credit remained in place.
How China has managed to make cheaper EVs Many models of BYD, a Chinese Tesla competitor, are selling in China for the equivalent of around $20,000.
While these practices created trade tensions and contributed to price wars among Chinese EV makers, consumers in China ultimately stood to benefit from more affordable EVs.","Tesla's price point for its ""more affordable"" models is still higher than Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, floated in 2020. The reasons for these sticky prices may be bigger than Tesla.

On Tuesday, Tesla launched ""standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, at $39,990 and $36,990, respectively.

The ""standard"" models are between $5,000 and $5,500 cheaper than the flagship versions — sans Autosteer and a radio — and the market was not enthusiastic. Tesla shares dipped around 4.4% after the launch on market closing compared to the day before.

EV and trade policies in the US may be to blame for these prices not being as low as Musk touted and analysts hoped.

""What I would criticize about the US's approach to EVs is that they're making it really hard to build supply chains,"" Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, told Business Insider.

Fisher pointed out that most critical minerals needed to make EV batteries are mined and processed in China. While some rare earths are exempt from tariffs, others, such as graphite, face a 93.5% duty. Additionally, batteries that are already assembled also face tariffs upon entry.

On October 9, China's leader, Xi Jinping, expanded restrictions on rare earth exports and said that an increase in exports would ""clog"" the markets.

Unlike other relatively affordable EVs sold in the US, like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Equinox, Tesla manufactures its cars for the US market in its Fremont Factory in California and Gigafactory Texas, where land, labor, and permits are already costly.

""When you slapped not just a large tariff, but a large and uncertain tariff on that type of trade, it is really hard to plan,"" said Fisher. ""If I were in the car business, thinking about building an EV or a hybrid and installing a bunch of batteries in the vehicle, I'm not sure what I would do.""

Trump's EV policies

To add to Tesla's pricing woes, the US is moving in the opposite direction in terms of EV policy compared to other major EV markets worldwide, especially China.

In January, Trump signed an executive order to suspend all disbursements of Inflation Reduction Act funding, a Biden-era package passed by Congress that aims to boost clean energy production and job creation in rural America. The set of 119 provisions includes up to $7,500 in tax credit for new EV buyers, credits for businesses purchasing commercial clean vehicles, and funding to build more charging stations.

In April, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to take ""immediate steps"" to reinstate IRA funding that had already been awarded to projects.

However, the Big Beautiful Bill, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump, still eliminated EV tax credits for all vehicles purchased after September 30. As a result, Tesla's new cheaper models are still around $2,000 more expensive than what the flagship versions would have cost had the $7,500 EV credit remained in place.

Tesla also used to be able to make an income by selling clean vehicle credits to combustion engine vehicle manufacturers that fail to meet emission standards, until Trump eliminated the fines on those automakers, which Fisher said may be limiting Tesla's financial ability to comfortably make a larger price cut.

How China has managed to make cheaper EVs

Many models of BYD, a Chinese Tesla competitor, are selling in China for the equivalent of around $20,000.

""If you look at China, it has the advantage of labor, and it is not as strict on environmental standards,"" said Fisher. ""And in terms of permitting and just getting things done, every permit is way harder to obtain in the US, and even if you do, there is a good chance you would get sued for it.""

The government is another factor. According to the Rhodium Group, China's government auto purchase subsidies are expected to reach a record high of 342 billion yuan in 2025, comprising 150 billion yuan in scrappage and trade-in subsidies, as well as 192 billion yuan in auto purchase tax exemptions. The research group estimates that this sum would be equivalent to 3% of the central government's fiscal revenues and account for 7% of passenger car retail sales this year.

The EU Commission called these subsidies an ""unfair"" trade practice last year and slapped up to 45.3% in duties on Chinese EVs in 2024, but many models, such as the BYD Atto 3 Comfort, remain competitive in the European market. While these practices created trade tensions and contributed to price wars among Chinese EV makers, consumers in China ultimately stood to benefit from more affordable EVs.

""Ideally, people should have access to the cars they want to buy, and the production of the vehicles should be based on consumer demand and not what candy the government's throwing at you,"" said Fisher. ""But if making the cheapest EV possible is the game, China is definitely winning at that game.""",https://i.insider.com/68e8475c1c1f80efbec55298?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-10-13 12:06:34.772439

According to figures presented at the annual meeting of the Spanish Energy Club, the country ranks second in Europe for foreign investment and fourth globally in sustainability.

These results reflect growing international confidence in Spain’s regulatory framework, technological diversity and the competitiveness of its electricity system — factors that have positioned it at the heart of Europe’s energy transition.

Spain’s role is further strengthened by a strategy centred on smart grids, energy storage and new industrial capacities linked to hydrogen and digitalisation.

In recent weeks, several public‑private agendas with Asia have underscored this international projection: Galicia completed an official mission to Japan to attract industrial investment; APPA Renovables promoted Spanish participation in the EU Business Hub Japan‑Korea programme and in China’s Battery Tour (13–17 October); and the Basque Hydrogen Corridor continues its collaboration with Japan through Basque Trade & Investment, JETRO and the Energy Cluster, with further joint actions planned for 2025 around hydrogen and its value chain.

As Europe seeks energy autonomy and resilience, the Iberian Peninsula emerges as a key space for green reindustrialisation. Spain and Portugal share a unique advantage: abundant natural resources, mature infrastructure and sustained political will that allow them to accelerate decarbonisation and attract international capital.

The international expansion of Spain’s renewable sector has found in Asia a strategic partner. According to Javier Muñoz, General Director of APPA Renovables, recent trade missions and institutional meetings with Japan, Korea, China and Thailand illustrate an increasingly solid relationship between complementary markets.

“Spain has reached a level of maturity that allows it to share regulatory and technological experience with countries in earlier stages of their energy transition,” Muñoz explained.

In this exchange, Asian countries contribute industrial and technological capacity that strengthens the Spanish value chain, while Spain’s regulatory know‑how and experience in renewable integration consolidate its position as an international benchmark.

Japan and Korea stand out for their expertise in engineering and digital networks; China for its photovoltaic and components industry; and Thailand for its bioenergy development based on agricultural resources. These strengths complement the Spanish ecosystem in fields such as renewable hydrogen, storage and smart‑grid management.

Opportunities and benefits for Spanish industry

The rapprochement with Asia marks a turning point in the internationalisation of Spain’s renewable sector. Muñoz noted that this exchange not only opens new markets but also redefines the industrial scope of clean energy: “We are moving from exporting projects to exporting knowledge. Sharing our regulatory and technical experience positions us as preferred partners in a global context that values stability and innovation.”

Collaborations with Asia aim to strengthen complementary value chains. Speaking to Strategic Energy Europe, the head of APPA Renovables explained that many Spanish companies are joining consortia for offshore wind tenders in Japan and Korea, while others are developing components and smart systems with Asian manufacturers already investing in plants within Spain. “Technology transfer is becoming a two‑way street: they provide industrial capacity, and we contribute design, regulation and integration expertise,” he said.

Within this framework, renewable hydrogen and bioenergy stand out as strategic cooperation axes. Thailand offers opportunities linked to its agricultural base, while Japan and Korea demand solutions for green‑origin certification and advanced logistics — areas where Spanish firms are beginning to excel.

“These alliances not only create contracts and jobs but also reinforce Spain’s image as a country capable of leading energy innovation through international collaboration,” Muñoz concluded.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-18.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:07:45.331319

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of US solar manufacturing.
Both T1 Energy and Talon PV have emerged as major players in the US solar manufacturing industry, leading efforts to produce domestic solar cells alongside firms like ES Foundry and Suniva.
For its part, T1 Energy has inked a “landmark” deal with Michigan-based manufacturing giant Corning to source US-made polysilicon and silicon wafers.
We published a series of interviews with leading figures in the US solar manufacturing industry in recent weeks.","T1 Energy did not disclose the stake it has acquired or the value of its investment. The companies have entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) and “remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future”.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1 Energy’s CEO and chairman of the board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

Both Talon PV and T1 Energy are planning to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells at their respective facilities. The technology has been the subject of much intellectual property litigation in the US, as various companies sought to establish TOPCon production lines.

However, Talon PV has acquired a TOPCon IP portfolio from cadmium telluride (CdTe) module manufacturer First Solar, which it told PV Tech Premium would clear the way for commercial TOPCon cell production in the US. It is unconfirmed whether the two companies plan to share intellectual property after the investment.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of US solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and CEO of Talon.

Both T1 Energy and Talon PV have emerged as major players in the US solar manufacturing industry, leading efforts to produce domestic solar cells alongside firms like ES Foundry and Suniva. The industry has built around 50GW of solar module production capacity, but cells and other upstream components have been far slower to materialise.

For its part, T1 Energy has inked a “landmark” deal with Michigan-based manufacturing giant Corning to source US-made polysilicon and silicon wafers. Combined with its planned cell and module production facilities, the deal would see a fully US-made silicon solar supply chain realised and would mark a significant moment in the country’s PV manufacturing industry.

Pro-Trump solar manufacturers

T1 Energy said both its project and Talon PV’s site are “supported by President Trump’s OBBBA (One Big, Beautiful Bill Act) and 45X tax credits.”

The company, which was formed when it bought Chinese solar manufacturing giant Trina Solar’s US module manufacturing facility last year, has previously expressed support for tariffs on PV imports to the US.

It said that the looming Section 232 tariffs on all polysilicon imports would “boost” American manufacturing and that further antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) levies would “strengthen our efforts to build an American advanced manufacturing champion”. Barcelo has also expressed support for Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” global tariff regime on all imports to the US.

Other industry observers and analysts have been more critical of the impacts of the president’s policies on solar manufacturing. We heard earlier this year from Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst at Clean Energy Associates (CEA), who said that the OBBBA was more damaging for manufacturers than solar development, as the twin issues of a shrinking solar end market and the removal of tax incentives to use US products put pressure on many firms.

However, PV Tech reported earlier this year that US solar manufacturing capacity has increased by 800% since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, and module capacity is roughly equal to the size of the US market in 2024. Upstream components remain more challenging, and much of the US module market will still rely on increasingly expensive cell and wafer imports for the foreseeable future.

26 First Nations people have been selected from over 100 applicants to participate in PowerMakers, a transformative capacity building program for First Nations people pursuing clean energy solutions in homes, communities, and on Country.

Designed and delivered by the First Nations Clean Energy Network with assistance from trusted experts in government, academia and industry, and our clean energy kin in Canada, this year’s annual PowerMakers program is being held in Mparntwe (Alice Springs), Northern Territory from 13-16 October 2025.

Karrina Nolan, co-Chair of the First Nations Clean Energy Network says:

“PowerMakers is about supporting and resourcing our community members to have access to knowledge and expertise to really engage in the clean energy transition.

“In the last 5 years we’ve seen a significant shift in the role of our communities in the transition to clean energy.

“The First Nations Clean Energy Network’s members through connecting community, industry and government have changed the story about what's possible when we genuinely engage and consent to projects.

“However, irregular temperatures and climatic extremes are exacerbating energy insecurity issues.

“We know that it's possible to play a greater role in how energy is generated and supplied, to respond to changing weather conditions, sub-standard housing and affordability, and to determine, collaborate and benefit-share in projects.

“First Nations groups – assisted by previous PowerMaker cohorts sharing knowledge back home with communities – are aware that work needs to be done to ensure our people aren’t left behind in Australia’s clean energy transition.

“Energy systems are typically designed around the needs of governments or utilities, rather than community members, making it difficult for First Nations to access rooftop solar and batteries and the cost savings enjoyed by so many people in Australia.

“Access to capital and innovative finance mechanisms through Special Investment Vehicles must be made available to First Nations groups to build energy justice outcomes in communities and on-Country, such as community-led projects reducing diesel reliance and which improve energy aﬀordability.

“And embedding First Nations rights in law and process, and Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) will accelerate Australia's renewable energy build-out, by reducing project delays, lowering risk, and unlocking underutilised economic resources.

“The 26 participants in this year’s PowerMakers are already doing trail blazing work advocating, planning or leading development of clean energy projects to secure affordable reliable energy, with others preparing for or skilled in negotiations with clean energy proponents around jobs and training, local procurement, benefit-sharing, equity participation, and sustainable values-based access to land and sea.

“PowerMakers is an investment in building the capacity and resourcing of communities towards First Nations ownership and economic development.

“By building on existing skills and knowledge, and sharing learnings and solutions, existing and emerging PowerMakers are ready to seek out, contribute to and benefit from the collective progress of First Nations leading the energy transition throughout Australia.”

PowerMaker 2025 participant Trinity Clarke, a Director of Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation in Queensland says:

“We’re very interested in sustainable clean and reliable power for our mob. Not having reliable power is something we experience every day.

“We have secured funding to build a community-owned microgrid in Wujal Wujal which is very exciting. We know the issues in our communities and it’s something we’ve wanted for a while.

“Owning our own energy means we can look at further aspirations around storing food, and setting up a dialysis clinic, and other measures most people around the country take for granted, but which stay out of reach when you don’t have reliable power.

“Right now we’re working hard to set up governance frameworks for our new majority Yalanji-owned power company backed by a partnership between Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation and Volt Advisory.

“PowerMakers will provide me with an opportunity to learn from other mob and share our power journey in Yalanji country.”

PowerMaker 2025 participant Mike Gilby, Director of Malyangapa Native Title Claimant Group from the tri-state pocket covering NSW, South Australia and Queensland says:

“Representing our native title group, I will use the opportunity at PowerMakers to sit and listen to what other Countrymen are doing on Country.

“I’ve been watching the evolution of clean energy over the past decade, starting with Snowy Hydro.

“My interest is hydro technology, and we’re looking at how we can repurpose the infrastructure already in place at those locks and weirs – from the Hume Dam all the way to the Murray Mouth, and we’re also looking at the clean energy corridors being constructed for transmission, with towers scattered along First Nations’ country.

“Our Malyangapa Native Title Claimant Group have had discussions with the clean energy industry, particularly around solar and wind farms. There’s no on-country projects yet but it’s certainly a conversation.

“It’s about thriving ecosystems that are driving our interests, to bring about some equilibrium in our part of the world.”

The automaker will redirect investments toward electric vehicles, batteries, and charging technology, citing greater scalability and market demand.

The shift comes amid potential federal grant cancellations and underscores hydrogen’s limited infrastructure and high costs in the U.S.

General Motors will end development of next-generation hydrogen fuel cells under its HYDROTEC brand as it pivots more aggressively toward electric vehicles and battery technology.

As part of the move, GM laid off salaried employees primarily in Pontiac, Michigan, following the closure of its HYDROTEC plant. The company said it is prioritizing investments in EV technology and redirecting its workforce and supplier relationships toward that effort.

The decision reflects GM’s growing confidence in EVs and its doubts about hydrogen’s near-term viability for consumer applications. While hydrogen fuel cells offer quick refueling and long range, the high production cost and limited fueling network have restricted growth. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are only 61 hydrogen refueling stations nationwide compared to more than 250,000 Level 2 or faster EV charging locations.

Notably, GM will continue producing hydrogen fuel cells through Fuel Cell System Manufacturing LLC, a joint venture with Honda, to serve industrial and commercial sectors, including power generation, mining, and heavy trucking.

The move follows the Trump administration’s recent indication that it plans to cancel two federal grants totaling $52 million that were previously awarded to GM for hydrogen development projects in Pontiac. The federal government had already distributed $9 million of the funding before the potential reversal.

Lawlor is adamant that climate activists are human rights defenders.
Human rights are now being targeted in the rush for critical minerals and new sources of non-fossil energy.
“Governments are repressing human rights defenders and the current trajectory is incompatible with the realization of human rights for all.
On Thursday Lawlor will repeat calls on governments to stop treating climate defenders like enemies, and instead work with them on a just transition to prevent climate catastrophe.","Human rights defenders organizing to prevent climate catastrophe are facing a surge in reprisals, as governments around the world denigrate, delegitimize and criminalize activists in spite of worsening global heating, a top United Nations official has told the Guardian.

Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders since 2020, has documented hundreds of cases where states have sought to smear and silence climate defenders engaged in peaceful protest, non-violent civil disobedience and litigation.

“Attacks against climate defenders have surged over the course of the mandate, and we now see outright repression against people who are organizing for climate action. It’s some of the states that have claimed to be the strongest supporters of human rights defenders including the UK, Germany, France and the US, that are most often repressing climate activists and where the right to protest is being denigrated and delegitimized.

“These big countries spew out the rhetoric about 1.5C, but they don’t mean it. They are playing the game to suit themselves. It’s business as usual,” Lawlor said in an interview with the Guardian.

Lawlor will present the penultimate report of her six-year mandate, “Tipping points: Human rights defenders, climate change and a just transition”, to the UN general assembly on 16 October.

It documents state repression including police violence and surveillance, civil litigation deployed to deliberately wear down and silence climate defenders known as Slapp (strategic lawsuits against public participation), as well as bogus criminal charges ranging from sedition, criminal defamation, terrorism and conspiracy to trespass, to public disorder and to disobedience.

In December 2023, the Just Stop Oil member Stephen Gingell became the first person to be jailed under the UK’s new public order legislation after taking part for 30 minutes in a peaceful slow-march protest on a London road.

“The UK is leading by bad example, abusing the international standards to which it itself agreed by bringing in these draconian laws that are designed to stop protest against any of the issues that are uncomfortable for the UK government.”

In the US, about 1,000 criminal cases were brought in Minnesota against people involved in non-violent actions against the Line 3 oil pipeline, including charges of attempted assisted suicide and trespass on critical infrastructure. While most cases were eventually dismissed or overturned, legitimate concerns about Indigenous lands, environmental harm and climate impacts were ignored and the pipeline began operations in 2021.

The criminalization of Line 3 protesters mirrored the repression seen during the 2016 Indigenous-led movement against the Dakota Access pipeline in the US. “Both instances entailed close collaboration between the companies involved and the police, indicating the adoption of a blueprint for the repression of climate activism in the United States,” the report states.

The Guardian has previously reported on a criminalization playbook used against climate and environmental activists, that is being adopted and shared in the US and internationally.

One trend documented by Lawlor is the conflation of non-violent climate action with terrorism. In 2022, the French minister of interior at the time, and current minister of justice, accused the national environmental movement Les Soulèvements de la Terre of “ecoterrorism”. The government sought to close down the group, but the country’s highest administrative court eventually overturned the effort.

Lawlor is adamant that climate activists are human rights defenders. They use non-violent protest, disruptive civil disobedience and litigation to stop fossil fuel projects and pressure elected officials to take meaningful action precisely because they are trying to protect the right to food, clean water, health, life and a healthy environment.

“These people are exercising the right to defend human rights. Of course some climate groups are disruptive, but that’s because they tried so hard for so long to use normal run of the mill techniques to achieve change, and the government did nothing. Look at change throughout the century by people like Martin Luther King and Gandhi, civil disobedience is sometimes necessary,” said Lawlor, who is the founder and former executive director of Front Line Defenders and former director of the Irish branch of Amnesty International.

But it’s not just fossil fuels. Human rights are now being targeted in the rush for critical minerals and new sources of non-fossil energy. The same repressive playbook is being used by governments and private companies involved in land grabs, pollution and Indigenous rights violations in pursuit of a green transition.

In Vietnam, which has committed itself to a just transition and net-zero emissions by 2050, the environmental lawyer Dang Dinh Bach was sentenced to five years in prison in January 2022 on bogus charges of tax evasion. Bach, who is among several climate activists imprisoned in Vietnam after advocating for the transition away from coal, is a victim of arbitrary detention, according to UN experts.

In Kenya, police fired rubber bullets and teargas at villagers in Uyombo in 2024, who were peacefully protesting against construction of a nuclear power plant facility on their land without consent.

“Governments are repressing human rights defenders and the current trajectory is incompatible with the realization of human rights for all. It’s just a road to destruction … I think states are behaving in a criminal fashion,” Lawlor said.

On Thursday Lawlor will repeat calls on governments to stop treating climate defenders like enemies, and instead work with them on a just transition to prevent climate catastrophe.

“No system, no power, no government, no big company seeking profit should trump the rights of billions of people in the world. And that’s what’s happening.

In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency recommended stricter limits after new research showed mussels, snails and other aquatic life are more sensitive to ammonia than previously understood.

""EPA included additional species in its calculations, and the new recommendations are stricter than what's in our current regulations,"" said Mike Kruse, environmental program manager for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' Watershed Protection Section. ""We're proposing to adopt those standards to better protect aquatic life in Missouri streams and lakes.""

Unlike a single fixed number, ammonia criteria typically use formulas that vary depending on factors such as pH, or water temperature. Missouri regulators plan to calculate limits by using region-specific standards.

Kruse said the impact will be felt most by small rural communities that rely on lagoon systems, which were not designed to treat ammonia at the stricter levels. ""Upgrading them would mean essentially rebuilding the treatment plant,"" he said. ""For small communities with shrinking populations, that's a pretty significant cost.""

To ease the transition, the state is offering variances — temporary exceptions that let facilities show the highest level of treatment they can realistically achieve and request more time to comply with the new federal standards. Larger city plants must also meet the new requirements, but their infrastructure is better-equipped to handle the changes without major upgrades, Kruse said.

The DNRC held an open house this week to guide community representatives through the variance application process. Additional sessions are planned in the coming months.

The proposal now enters an 18-month public rulemaking process that includes writing a regulatory impact report followed by public comments and review by Missouri's Clean Water Commission, all before statewide enforcement.

This has been well reported, but the consequences of these changes on the private, not-for-profit sector, has not received as much attention.

The federal bureaucracy is an easy target for its critics. It has no coherent master plan. It began with core duties of any country (defense, diplomacy, treasury) but then had manage the geographic growth of the country. Then industrialization often erased state borders and federalized many policy areas. At key moments, constituency groups like veterans, labor groups, agricultural interests etc. requested government attention and regulatory agencies developed from periodic market failures, new technologies, or to quash discrimination. The resulting crazy quilt of agencies and departments is easy for critics to question.

Further, just as the federal government grew, significant corruption reforms led to civil servants being hired based on their expertise rather than political allegiance. The resulting neutral competence is beneficial, but does collide with principles that presidential elections provide clear mandates to govern. We both want neutral experts to craft policies but also want elections to matter, which has frustrated presidents long before President Trump, but it’s particularly vivid in this polarized age.

Consequently, the strange structure, tension between neutral competence and electoral responsiveness, and a particularly American resistance to centralized government has formed a conventional wisdom that the federal bureaucracy is way too big and clumsy.

International comparison

Interestingly, the US public sector is far smaller than other democracies. Federal, state, and local public sector employment in the US is around 25% lower than most European democracies, which matches the level that American government spending is lower than European Union countries’ public expenditures, despite far greater spending on defense in the US. Our taxes as a percentage of our overall economy are 25% to 40% lower than these countries as well.

Europeans are perfectly comfortable with a larger governing role in society. European Social Democrats and even European Conservative parties dominate elections and both believe that taxing and redistributing wealth bring social equality and stability. Despite our polarized rhetoric, both American parties prefer lower taxes and spending relative to European mainstream parties.

While American skepticism toward big government is deeply baked into our political culture, that does not mean Americans support dramatic cuts in practice. The Pew Research Center finds that a majority of Americans favor most federal agencies and, except for ICE, Justice, and the IRS, all named agencies have more people favoring them than not. Further, most public policy research indicates that the federal government performs well on efficiency relative to other democracies. And before DOGE, the Government Accountability Office has long closely audited government agencies and publicly reported inefficiencies, waste, and policies that didn’t measure up.

Whether the DOGE cuts are legal or responsible is being decided by courts and Congress. One ironic, less-discussed problem that may emerge from such sudden cuts is there potential harm for the not-for-profit sectors that Americans prefer tackling social issues like health, human services, education, and the arts.

Again, a comparative historical look is helpful. Most European countries fully democratized after the socialist movement, which simultaneously pressed for equality and democracy and created the welfare state systems. American democracy began well before the pressures of the industrial revolution and Americans, who had the right to vote across classes even if not gender and race, rejected socialism and large-scale welfare state. So American beliefs of individualism and limited government meant that civil society — churches and not-for-profits — tackled thorny social problems more so and prior to the federal government.

Leveraging the non-for-profit arena

When the US government did later step into these social issues due the scale of hardship from the depression and social inequalities, its policies leveraged not-for-profit partners rather than directly handling issues with government agency employees. This grant-based approach is a very American approach of strengthening civil society addressing policy problems rather than a government takeover.

The Urban Institute reports the level of these federal grants. About 27% of health, human services, education and arts-based not-for-profit groups receive federal grants, which is almost identical to the 26% of such Indiana not-for-profits that receive these federal grants. Two-thirds of these groups receive less than 25% of their funds from federal, state, or local grants, so the majority of their funding comes from the private sector.

It’s healthy to debate how much government should be spending, but during the debate it should be considered whether sudden cuts to what is around 25% of not-for-profit budgets could permanently damage groups doing social work. For instance, the network of groups that carries out humanitarian aid around the work that received USAID grants have been devastated by the USAID grant cuts. If major humanitarian issues develop — on top of those existing crushing ones — the private sector groups may be defunct or lack the capacity to address those problems.

Moving forward, it’s vital to consider the balance of public funds to the private sector. There’s consensus among Americans that civil society should be dealing with social issues. Consequently, ensuring that civil society groups thrive must be considered in the pace and level of cuts.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA105187-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:01:28.848971

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works.
Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant.
The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.
“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said.","This story is published in partnership with Inside Climate News and WHQR. It is the first in an ongoing series about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina, “Forever War.”

Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.

But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens within a family of chemicals that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.

Donovan felt devastated and enraged.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”

In 2013, scientists first discovered seven different types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several public utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.

The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians.

It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators, and local residents, started urging the EPA and state officials to regulate the compounds.

Many activists went to Congress and to the courts. Clean Cape Fear even pleaded its case to United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”

Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found PFAS in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs, and beer. Pine needles, honey, and house dust. Landfills, compost, and sewage sludge.

Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.

Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.

The celebration was brief.

Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin—with support from the chemical industry—began dismantling those hard-won protections.

And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

2013-2016: A Movement Is Born

The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.

On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was releasing PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.

Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction, and environmental engineering at N.C. State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”

Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel, and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.

Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.

Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.

“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”

The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing, and playing in contaminated water.

As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.

We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.

When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.

Then a freelance reporter for the Wilmington Star-News, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings.

People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.

“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”

2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear

Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.

She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.

In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.

The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.

In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.

Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA, and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.

2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature

Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr. is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.

Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.

Yet after a contentious commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another one.

Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”

Davis, who became the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.

Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.

Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: a $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.

“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”

2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer

Brian Long, the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.

It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.

“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”

EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the liver, kidneys and immune system.

Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer.

Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain, and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.

New Hanover and Brunswick counties had some of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in North Carolina, according to the state cancer registry. Rates of testicular cancer were also significantly elevated in nearby Pender County, which later detected high levels of PFAS in its drinking water.

Several advocates felt illnesses in their family might be linked to PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.

Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, who had been diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.

Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.

She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”

One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.

“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.

The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”

2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal

Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:

Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin.

Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.

Steer the tired alligator to the bank.

Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).

Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.

Burdette helped N.C. State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators can live long lives in contaminated water, so they can serve as models for detecting human health problems.

The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 types of PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.

It had been more than a year since the contamination became public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.

Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.

“We sued,” Burdette said.

SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act.

By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.

“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”

By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.

No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.

DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.

“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”

In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.

“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”

Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses, and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.

“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”

At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.

“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”

Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”

Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.

2021-2022: Quest for Accountability

One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.

Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.

Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. N.C. State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.

In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.

“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”

The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.

In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.

The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.

2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers

Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.

Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA, and environmental advocates were becoming impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.

He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion, and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.

Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.

“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”

Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.

“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”

Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.

Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”

Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.

“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“

The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $2 billion to help utilities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, but that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.

In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.

Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.

Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.

May 2025: The Persistent Republican

It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.

“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”

Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.

If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance, and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.

“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”

A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick, and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.

“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”

Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.

The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.

Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.

“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”

With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.

2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained

A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.

The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.

Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at N.C. State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.

Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.

After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.

“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.

“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”

June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill

Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.

A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”

“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”

The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.

Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.

Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.

The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.

September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX Rollback

In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.

“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”

The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it did so out of sequence.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.

Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period, during which over More than 120,000 comments were submitted—including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.

The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.

Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized the standards simultaneously, instead of moving through each action separately. This, Zeldin argued, “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.

A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”

Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.

The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.

“Chemours is using this as their basis for saying the science is flawed,” she said. “That’s ridiculous.”

The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.

However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.

EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.

More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.

It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.

“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”

The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus, and Pender counties.

This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing; of those, state records show nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.

Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.

DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

In a time of rapid technological change and global geopolitical flux, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is executing one of the most ambitious transformations in its history. At the intersection of science, economic policy, and national security, the Research, Technology, and Economic Security (RTES) framework represents a bold attempt to futureproof the nation’s energy architecture while ensuring responsible stewardship of public funds. In doing so, the DOE is not only refining how it governs federal investments but also how it positions America as a science and technology leader in a competitive global landscape.

The priorities of the DOE, the risk-based mechanisms underlying the RTES framework, and how those efforts are translating into tangible impacts, from protecting intellectual property (IP) and strengthening supply chains to fostering energy independence and global clean energy leadership, are evolving. The conversation comes at a critical time when American leadership in energy innovation could determine not just economic prosperity but also geopolitical leverage. Stakeholders from policy, industry, and academia will need to be aware of these changes, as they can gain particular value from understanding how the DOE is operationalizing RTES to drive resilience, growth, and sustainability simultaneously.

Resilient by design: Core elements of the RTES framework

The Research, Technology, and Economic Security (RTES) memo (1), formally adopted in November 2024, provides a comprehensive lens through which the DOE governs risk, value, and opportunity across its energy and research portfolio. It reflects a structured, harmonized, and nuanced approach to balancing open innovation with national security imperatives. Let us explore it in more detail.

Taxpayer-first risk discipline:

The framework places strong emphasis on transparency and accountability in the management of federal funding. One key example is the DOE’s policy change introduced in May 2025 to cap indirect cost reimbursements, with 10% for state and local governments and 15% for non-profits and for-profit institutions. These reforms are projected to save taxpayers nearly $935 million annually. (2)

Proportional risk mitigation:

RTES incorporates a tiered, stage-specific system to assess and mitigate risks across basic research, applied development, and full-scale deployment. By categorizing activities by technology readiness levels, the DOE applies proportionate risk controls to different funding instruments, including grants, loans, and cooperative agreements.

Multi-dimensional risk coverage:

From IP theft and supply chain dependencies to grid security and foreign influence, RTES covers a broad array of risk dimensions. The framework empowers program officers to implement tailored controls across the award lifecycle, informed by inputs from DOE’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. (3)

Enabling strategic collaboration:

Perhaps most critically, the DOE retains a commitment to open science and international collaboration. The framework recognizes that foreign partnerships and talent exchange are foundational to U.S. leadership in scientific discovery and innovation, so long as the risks are assessed and managed.

Turning policy into practice: Real-world deployments and case studies

The implications of the RTES framework are already visible across multiple operational domains. DOE program offices and National Labs are actively applying their principles to shape funding decisions, partnership eligibility, and technology investments. Let us introduce the main elements.

Supply chain resilience with the SCRL tool:

The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), in partnership with the National Laboratories, developed the Supply Chain Readiness Levels (SCRL) tool. (4) This analytics platform maps vulnerabilities in critical energy supply chains, especially dependencies on “covered nations”, and guides both federal and private sector investment priorities. The tool is being used to address supply risk in battery minerals, transformers, and grid components.

Geothermal innovation pilots:

In 2024, the DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office announced over $30 million in funding for reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) demonstration projects. (5) These pilots are testing new wellbore construction and high-temperature tools that can serve as baseload renewable power, offering grid flexibility while reducing emissions.

Scientific integrity and IP protection:

The RTES Office mandates complete disclosure of foreign affiliations and institutional partnerships in all grant and contract proposals. This has led to the rejection or revision of several projects where IP risk or foreign control could not be mitigated. These processes ensure the integrity of federal investments in high-impact R&D. (6)

Post-2025 energy dominance agenda:

Following the return of President Trump in 2025, the DOE issued sweeping secretarial orders to accelerate fossil fuel permitting, expand LNG exports, and reauthorize offshore oil and gas leases. Within 100 days, the DOE approved more new LNG export capacity than any nation outside the U.S. possesses, cementing the country’s status as the top oil and gas producer and exporter. (7)

Building a clean tech superpower: Renewable energy and economic growth

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) plays a central role in advancing clean energy innovation and commercialization. The EERE has streamlined its strategy around high-potential domains such as solar, wind, hydrogen, bioenergy, and sustainable mobility. Let us see how this is progressing.

Capitalizing on a $23 trillion market:

With the global renewable energy market projected to exceed $23 trillion by 2030, the U.S. is positioning itself to capture market share through smart policy and strategic public investment. Programs like the Loan Programs Office and clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act are enabling private capital leverage, creating manufacturing hubs, and generating clean jobs. (8)

Job creation and economic renewal:

Since 2021, clean energy projects have attracted more than $450 billion in private investment and created over 400,000 new jobs across sectors such as solar panel manufacturing, wind turbine logistics, battery storage, and electric vehicles. These gains have helped revitalize regional economies and support the U.S. manufacturing base. (9)

Health and household benefits:

Energy-efficient technologies are reducing household utility bills, improving indoor air quality, and cutting emissions that contribute to respiratory disease. DOE analysis suggests that combined benefits from clean energy deployment could generate tens of billions of dollars annually in public health savings. (10)

The road ahead: Future trends and strategic challenges

As the RTES framework matures and implementation scales, several trends and hurdles will define its long- term success. The use of analytical platforms like SCRL will be essential in dynamically tracking supply chain risks. Expanding these tools to cover emerging sectors such as hydrogen, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), and rare earth magnets could help preempt future dependencies.

Furthermore, navigating the dual mandate of open science and secure innovation will remain challenging. The DOE must continue refining its evaluation criteria to allow for collaboration without compromising IP integrity or national competitiveness.

In terms of scaling deployment infrastructure, the U.S. will need trillions in grid upgrades, workforce training, and permitting reform to accommodate the full potential of renewable energy resources. This will require bipartisan policy support, private sector coordination, and ongoing EERE leadership.

Finally, geopolitical volatility persists. As tensions with China, Russia, and other state actors persist, the DOE’s RTES playbook must remain agile, balancing proactive risk mitigation with a forward-looking innovation strategy.

Final thoughts: Innovation secured and scaled

The U.S. Department of Energy’s RTES framework represents a paradigm shift in how public research dollars are governed. By weaving risk management into the core of its investment and oversight processes, DOE is charting a path toward resilience without sacrificing scientific openness. From grid security and clean energy leadership to economic development and international collaboration, the stakes of energy innovation have never been higher.

Through the synergy of EERE’s innovation programs and RTES’s accountability structures, the U.S. is laying the groundwork for a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous energy future. What remains now is to scale that vision with purpose, clarity, and enduring public trust.

One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington.","— Wisconsin has become a hotbed of data center activity over the past few years as some of the biggest names in the business rush to take advantage of accessible water, affordable electricity and the state’s cool climate.

At least 47 data centers are currently up and running or proposed in Wisconsin, according to Data Center Map. But experts say there could be more because some companies obscure their plans by entering into non-disclosure agreements and creating shell companies. The state’s vast supply of water, relatively affordable and available electricity, available land and colder climate to assist with cooling needs are attractive, experts add.

Past Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still said Wisconsin has been attracting a lot of data center activity lately because there’s a lot of available land, utilities have historically been reliable and the state’s construction industry is skilled and large enough to build the vast structures.

“I think that just finding the kinds of people who can work in these data centers is not as much of a challenge as it might be in other places, because there are computer science schools and tech colleges and other places that can help fill those jobs,” he added.

Wisconsin ranks behind other Midwestern states, though. Michigan has at least 57 data centers; Minnesota, 72; Indiana, 74; Iowa, 104; and Illinois, 222, according to DCM.

Almost half of those in Wisconsin, 21, are located in the Milwaukee area, with 11 in the Madison area and five in and around Kenosha. The rest are scattered around central Wisconsin, a DCM map shows.

DCM, founded in 2007, sources information from data center operators, end-users, through manual sourcing and more.

But many Wisconsinites, including prominent figures such as comedian Charlie Berens, have raised concerns about the environmental impact the data center boom will have. People are also concerned about rising utility costs associated with the increased demand on the power grid. A study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University found data centers are expected to grow electricity bills by as much as 25% in certain regions of the country.

What is a data center, and where are they?

Technically, a data center can be any room, building or facility housing information technology infrastructure for building, running and developing applications and services, according to IBM. Under that definition, anything from an in-house server room in an office to the more than 7 million square-feet of space at The Citadel Campus in Reno, Nevada, could be considered a data center.

One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington. The Port Washington Common Council in August approved a development deal to move forward with the project’s Denver-based company. But the Vantage project will only be a small portion of the larger 1,900-acre data center campus that Cloverleaf Infrastructure is planning.

The Washington-based developer touts “delivering clean-powered, ready-to-build projects,” but hasn’t announced who else will occupy the campus.

Aside from the difficulty in figuring out exactly how many and where all the data centers and projects are, it’s difficult to quantify how large each project is. DCM reports out of the 10,844 data centers it’s tracking, only 3,836 include how much power in megawatts they use, and just 1,812 include total building size.

Another large data center investment, at least by dollar amount, comes from Microsoft’s more than $7 billion plan to build two data centers at the former Foxconn site in Racine County’s Mount Pleasant.

That plan, which includes at least 1,575 acres, doesn’t include the two other recent Microsoft data center plans in nearby Caledonia and Kenosha. Microsoft in January purchased 240 acres in Kenosha. The Caledonia Plan Commission Sept. 29 approved amending a land-use plan to rezone a 245-acre site, but less than two weeks later Microsoft announced it was backing out of its Caledonia effort, citing “community concerns.”

Microsoft also announced it still plans to find another site in southeastern Wisconsin instead of Caledonia.

Those projects, if the company’s Caledonia replacement is the same size, would bring Microsoft’s total footprint to more than 2,000 acres of data centers in southeastern Wisconsin, but they’re not the only company vying to occupy such large tracts of land.

Some data centers, like the Wells Building, owned by 1547 Critical Systems Realty, are much less conspicuous. The structure, a 15-story building and one of Milwaukee’s oldest skyscrapers, has occupied the same lot in the heart of downtown since 1901.

The 124-year-old structure has long been a communication hub and houses more than 30 carriers such as AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon. As communication technology has changed, so too has the building’s infrastructure. Under 1547’s ownership, the Wells Building now boasts up to 12 megawatts of building capacity power and 5,000 square feet of currently available data center space.

But that power capacity pales in comparison to large-scale data centers.

Environmental impact

Cloverleaf boasts it will be ready to deliver 3.5 gigawatts of power by 2030. That’s nearly 300 times as much as the Wells Building.

Microsoft’s first Mount Pleasant project and the Vantage project combined will require roughly 3.9 gigawatts of power. That’s not including Microsoft’s second Mount Pleasant project.

Clean Wisconsin in an analysis of the two projects found that’s enough power for roughly 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, more than the roughly 2.8 million housing units that currently exist in the state.

Amy Barrilleaux, Clean Wisconsin’s communications director, also said the speed at which companies are forging ahead makes it difficult to quantify the environmental impact they will have. But it’s clear there will be lasting effects, she added.

“It is going to push Wisconsin into a place where we’re not any closer to our clean energy goals, our climate goals, in a summer when we’ve had terrible smoke and severe flooding,” she said. “And so I think we’re seeing, just in terms of the sheer demand of energy that these data centers are going to need, we’re seeing how big that is.”

Water consumption is another major concern, Barrilleaux said.

Many past data center designs required continual water consumption, pumping it into cooling systems to reduce the heat of technology and then pumping it right back out of the facility again. Newer designs tend to use closed-loop designs, which are filled with water that circulates through the technology and then is cooled back down through large radiators, similar to a car’s radiator system.

But the closed-loop design is a trade-off, Barrilleuz said, adding “those systems are more energy intensive.”

“So it’s important to understand that 70% of water withdrawals in Wisconsin are for power generation in this state,” she said. “So we do not have a good understanding of what the true water impact is going to be in Wisconsin, because we don’t, for most of these projects, know how much energy they’re going to use. We don’t know how many gallons of water they’re going to use on site. We don’t know exactly where they’re going to be getting this water from.”

Dan Diorio, vice president of the Data Center Coalition, said water usage by data centers in Virginia, the nation’s data center hub, is sustainable, and the state’s regulations help ensure things stay that way. He also argued the industry “is committed to responsible water use, and it prioritizes efficient water practices and responsible management across operations and development.”

“Data centers are also actively investing in and deploying innovations, such as waterless cooling systems, closed-loop systems, and the use of recycled or reclaimed water,” Diorio said. “The industry also engages in water and watershed conservation and restoration projects in local communities and globally.”

Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still also said it’s worth keeping an eye on how much power and water data centers will consume, as well as the ability to meet the demands without generating a large amount of pollution.

— The Universities of Wisconsin and the state’s technical colleges would get $10 million per year to develop a student success and retention system under a newly circulated proposal.

LRB-4778, which all 15 Democratic senators and almost every Assembly Dem have signed onto, would provide the $10 million per year over the next two years.

“Academic and career advisors assist students to ensure they are retained year-over-year, and can complete a degree on-time,” the cosponsorship memo argues. “These resources are helpful to all students, but often impact the trajectory of first-generation, veteran, and returning students the most.”

— An education funding-related proposal would fully fund the Wisconsin GI Bill program.

LRB-4388 would change state law from sum certain to sum sufficient to ensure state funding covers all GI Bill expenses at public universities and technical colleges. The GI Bill covers 128 credits or eight semesters for veterans to attend state public universities and tech colleges.

The new proposal would first apply to students enrolled in the fall 2026 semester.

— In-home care franchise Right at Home plans to open a new unit in Eau Claire.

The announcement doesn’t include any more specifics on timing or location, but notes the area’s aging population and existing brand awareness due to 11 other Right at Home locations across the state makes Eau Claire a logical location.

“As we continue to grow, we’re prioritizing markets like Eau Claire that align with our mission and offer potential for meaningful impact,” Jennifer Chaney, senior vice president of franchise development and sales, said. “We’re looking for passionate entrepreneurs who want to make a difference in their communities while benefiting from a proven business model and an extensive support system.”

— UW-Madison and TAE Life Sciences are taking steps to launch the first of a new type of cancer treatment center.

The two announced they’ve signed a memorandum of understanding to move forward with the collaboration. As part of the agreement, UW-Madison would install an Alphabeam compact accelerator-based boron neutron capture therapy system developed by TAE, a biotech company that specializes in targeted radiation therapy for cancer care.

The therapy selectively targets cancer cells to minimize the impact on nearby healthy cells. With the Alphabeam technology, patients undergo a short, minimally invasive treatment in one or two sessions.

Dr. Nita Ahuja, vice chancellor for Medical Affairs at UW-Madison, said the effort “signifies our commitment to cancer clinical trials that will give critical access to experimental treatments for difficult-to-treat brain and head and neck cancers.”

“It is an outstanding opportunity to leverage the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health’s strengths in areas such as oncology, theranostics, particle therapy, clinical research, drug development and medical physics, aligned with our vision of healthy people and healthy communities,” she added.

Currently, the technology only exists in Japan and China, and will soon be installed in Italy.

At least 47 data centers are currently up and running or proposed in Wisconsin, according to Data Center Map. But experts say there could be more because some companies obscure their plans by entering into non-disclosure agreements and creating shell companies. The state’s vast supply of water, relatively affordable and available electricity, available land and colder climate to assist with cooling needs are attractive, experts add.

Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still said Wisconsin has been attracting a lot of data center activity lately because there’s a lot of available land, utilities have historically been reliable and the state’s construction industry is skilled and large enough to build the vast structures.

“I think that just finding the kinds of people who can work in these data centers is not as much of a challenge as it might be in other places, because there are computer science schools and tech colleges and other places that can help fill those jobs,” he added.

Wisconsin ranks behind other Midwestern states, though. Michigan has at least 57 data centers; Minnesota, 72; Indiana, 74; Iowa, 104; and Illinois, 222, according to DCM.

Almost half of those in Wisconsin, 21, are located in the Milwaukee area, with 11 in the Madison area and five in and around Kenosha. The rest are scattered around central Wisconsin, a DCM map shows.

DCM, founded in 2007, sources information from data center operators, end-users, through manual sourcing and more.

Sizewell C, which will be built near Leiston in Suffolk, has agreed a six-year supply contract with Urenco - and a long-term fuel fabrication contract with Framatome.

The former will make natural uranium suitable for use at the power plant, before the latter turns it into pellets, which then form fuel assemblies for use inside its reactors.

Those behind the deal predict it will support and create thousands of jobs within the industry and minimise the plant's reliance on fuel imports.

Julia Pyke and Nigel Cann, joint managing directors of Sizewell C, said: ""These two contracts represent a major moment for Sizewell C and for energy security in the UK.

""The fuel that will go in our reactors will be low carbon and predominantly sourced from the UK, produced by skilled British workers.

""This is what we mean by doing infrastructure differently – and it puts the UK's energy security and our nuclear supply chain in a much stronger place.""

Sizewell C, which will cost £38bn to build, will supply electricity to the equivalent of six million homes for at least 60 years once it is operational, predicted to be in the 2030s.

Those behind the development say the project will directly support 10,000 jobs and thousands more in the supply chain, and create 1,500 apprenticeships.

Some of those include around 1,000 existing jobs at Urenco's enrichment site at Capenhurst, near Chester.

Sizewell's deal with Framatome, meanwhile, will initially see the fuel fabricated at its factory in Romans, France, until its new UK facility is built, creating yet more jobs.

WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification.","More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.

The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.

“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.

The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.

Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.

“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”

Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.

“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”

Battery power and rural grid upgrade

The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.

The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide this is to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”

The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.

The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”

Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.

The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.

Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.

The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.

Energy efficiency and innovation

Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.

“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.

Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.

Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.

Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.

The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.

If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.

A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.

“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”

Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.

‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program

A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.

“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”

Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out.

Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.

“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”

WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.

If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Power-lines___Scott-Olson-Getty-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:05.670951

The company also faces legal challenges from the California Coastal Commission, environmental groups and even its own investors.
Although the company reports that pipeline repairs are complete, the lines have not yet been approved for restart by state regulators.
However, the company says it continues to seek approvals to restart the pipelines from the California Office of the State Fire Marshal.
Sable Offshore Corp. is no different.”","When a Texas oil company first announced controversial plans to reactivate three drilling rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara County, investor presentations boasted that the venture had “massive resource potential” and was “primed for cash flow generation.”

But now, less than two years later, mounting legal setbacks and regulatory issues are casting increasing doubt on the project’s future.

Most recently, the California attorney general filed suit against Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp., accusing it of repeatedly putting “profits over environmental protections.” The lawsuit, filed last week in Santa Barbara County Superor Court, accuses Sable of continually failing to follow state laws and regulations intended to protect water resources.

Sable, the lawsuit claims, “was at best misinformed, incompetent and incorrect” when it came to understanding and adhering to the California Water Code. “At worst, Sable was simply bamboozling the Regional Water Board to meet a critical deadline,” according to the lawsuit.

The action comes less than a month after the Santa Barbara County district attorney’s office filed criminal charges against the company, accusing it of knowingly violating state environmental laws while working on repairs to oil pipelines that have sat idle since a major spill in 2015.

The company also faces legal challenges from the California Coastal Commission, environmental groups and even its own investors.

These developments now threaten the company’s ability to push forward on what has become an increasingly expensive and complicated project, according to some experts.

Clark Williams-Derry, an analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said there are still ways Sable could get off the ground and begin oil sales, but the repeated setbacks have become what he called “cumulative risk” for investors, who are key to funding the restart.

“Sable is at risk of burning through its cash, and lenders are going to have to make a decision about whether or not this is a good investment,” Williams-Derry said. Ongoing pushback from the public, the state and in lawsuits makes that increasingly a hard argument to make, he said.

Sable, however, said it remains steadfast in its goal of reactivating the Santa Ynez Unit — a complex of three offshore platforms, onshore processing facilities and connecting pipelines. The unit was shuttered by a different company a decade ago after a corroded section of pipeline ruptured near Refugio State Beach, creating one of the state’s worst oil spills.

The company denies that it has broken any laws and insists that it has followed all necessary regulations. Recently, however, company officials have promoted a new restart plan that could avoid California oversight.

Company officials say the new plan would keep the project entirely within federal waters — pivoting away from using the contentious pipelines and from what company officials called California’s “crumbling energy complex.”

Jim Flores, the company’s chief executive, said Sable is working with the Trump administration’s National Energy Dominance Council on the plan to use an offshore storage and treatment vessel to transport crude from its offshore wells instead of the pipeline system. Although the company reports that pipeline repairs are complete, the lines have not yet been approved for restart by state regulators.

“California has to make a decision soon on the pipeline before Sable signs an agreement for the [offshore vessel] and goes all in on the offshore federal-only option,” Flores said in a statement.

The company acknowledges that transporting oil by ship instead of pipeline would dramatically extend the company’s timeline and increase its costs. In a June Securities and Exchange Commission report, Sable said there was “substantial doubt ... about the company’s ability to continue,” given ongoing negative cash flow and stalled regulatory approvals.

However, the company says it continues to seek approvals to restart the pipelines from the California Office of the State Fire Marshal.

The state fire marshal has said the plans remain under review, but the office has made clear that the pipelines will be approved for operation only “once all compliance and safety requirements, including ... approvals from other state, federal and local agencies, are met.”

Deborah Sivas, a professor of environmental law at Stanford’s Law School, said it’s getting harder to see a successful path forward for Sable.

“It’s pretty rare that an entity would have all these agencies lined up concerned about their impacts,” Sivas said of state regulators. “These agencies don’t very lightly go to litigation or enforcement actions. ... and the public is strongly against offshore drilling. So those are a whole bunch of reasons that I think are going to be hard obstacles for that company.”

But even if Sable can pivot to federal-only oversight under a friendly Trump administration, Williams-Derry said there’s no clear-cut path.

“This is an environment where some of the best, most profitable oil companies in the U.S. have cut drilling this year because profits are too low,” Williams-Derry said. Sable has enough money in the bank right now to have a “little bit of running room,” he said, “...but you can imagine that [investors] are going to start running out of patience.”

The new lawsuit filed by the California attorney general lays out a year’s worth of instances in which Sable either ignored or defied the California Water Code during the firm’s pipeline repair work. The attorney general’s office called Sable’s evasion of regulatory oversight “egregious,” warranting “substantial penalties.”

It’s not immediately clear how much will be demanded, but violations of the California Water Code are subject to a civil liability of up to $5,000 for each day a violation occurs.

Despite repeated reminders and warnings from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast region, Sable did not comply with the water code, preventing the board “from assuring best management practices ... to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to water quality,” the lawsuit said.

“No corporation should gain a business advantage by ignoring the law and harming the environment,” Jane Gray, chair of the Central Coast Water Board, said in a statement. “Entities that discharge waste are required to obtain permits from the state to protect water quality. Sable Offshore Corp. is no different.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0fdaa47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Fd1%2F6e1a5a8847218fc2fa84bcfd9def%2F1501692-me-coastal-commission-hearing-27.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:54.465514

It’s time to reform permitting and start building again in Pennsylvania and across America.","We all know the value of affordable and reliable energy. From powering homes and businesses to supporting hundreds of thousands of good jobs for Pennsylvanians, energy means jobs, growth and opportunity. But demand for energy is surging fast.

America’s electricity demand is projected to increase 35 to 50 percent by 2040, driven in large part by new AI data centers.

In the PJM Interconnection, which includes Pennsylvania, 95 percent of new power demand through 2030 is expected to come from data centers, further straining a system that’s slow to bring new power sources online. Replacing retiring power sources, particularly reliable baseload power like natural gas, is essential to powering AI and keeping the lights on for American families.

A broken federal permitting system

The rapid rise of technology and the race for America’s future brings new urgency to fixing a broken, inefficient permitting system where projects are often stuck in red tape and buried in endless reviews, thus blocking the critical infrastructure needed to keep pace with demand.

Infrastructure project of all kinds – pipelines, power plants, transmission lines – even roads and bridges – face a myriad of federal approvals under a maze of outdated laws and regulations. Opponents regularly weaponize statutes like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA) to block development at every stage of permitting.

In natural gas-rich Pennsylvania and the Appalachia region, more takeaway capacity, including pipelines, is needed to move energy from the drilling field to consumers.

Major pipelines in the region, including PennEast, Constitution and Atlantic Coast, were cancelled after years of permitting delays and court challenges.

After nearly six years of lawsuits and delays, it took an act of Congress to help finish the 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline, which links Appalachian basin natural gas to markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

When infrastructure lags behind demand, supply tightens. Building new infrastructure helps energy flow faster to consumers and could help keep costs affordable.

While the Trump administration has taken steps to stop harmful mandates and restrictive energy policies to help bolster American energy dominance, congressional action on permitting reform is urgently needed to unlock America’s potential and get back to building. Enacting commonsense deadlines and predictable permitting processes can help ensure projects are built in years, not decades.

Three key areas must be addressed: 1) set deadlines and enforce them, 2) stop lawsuits and start building and 3) enforce targeted reviews and swift decisions.

Pennsylvania stands ready to build

Energy-rich Pennsylvania can benefit from permitting reform. Sitting atop the Marcellus shale, the largest natural gas formation in the U.S., Pennsylvania is the second-largest natural gas producer in America.

Pennsylvania has the natural resources and skilled workforce to advance U.S. energy dominance and build a stronger economy. Permitting reform can help unleash Pennsylvania energy to support innovation while creating good jobs and helping to keep energy costs affordable for consumers.

Without permit reform, Pennsylvanians could face energy shortages, much like they do in California and New England, where policy roadblocks restrict energy access and infrastructure projects.

Pennsylvanians shouldn’t have to pay the price for permitting delays, with fewer reliable energy options, because Washington can’t fix a broken permitting system. This doesn’t mean cutting corners on safety or the environment – it means using common sense, establishing clear deadlines and keeping critical projects moving forward – not trapped in red tape and litigation.

Congress must act on durable reforms that help ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come while helping to power U.S. technology and innovation.

It’s time to reform permitting and start building again in Pennsylvania and across America.

As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity.
“Everybody’s able to share.” Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities.","For years, Western leaders have debated the creation of a regional energy market: a coordinated grid to pool solar power in Arizona, wind in Wyoming, hydro in Washington and battery storage in California.

The shared resources would meet the demands of 11 different states, bolstering utilities’ local power plants with surplus energy from across the region.

With the passage of a landmark new law in California, that market is finally on its way to becoming a reality. Proponents say it has the potential to lower energy costs, make the grid more resilient and speed up the deployment of clean energy.

But the market’s success, experts agree, depends heavily on which states and utilities decide to opt in. As energy issues have become increasingly politicized, it’s uncertain whether Western leaders can buy into a common vision for meeting the region’s power needs.

“As we move toward weather-dependent renewables to run our grid, we’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern,” said California Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation aimed at establishing the new market. “A Western energy market is critical.”

The California measure earned bipartisan support, and leaders in conservative and liberal states alike have long touted the benefits of a region-wide market.

But some skeptics worry about merging the power systems of states with varying climate goals. And some fear the new market could give federal regulators appointed by President Donald Trump an opening to interfere and mandate more fossil fuel-powered plants that can be turned on regardless of the weather.

A bigger market

Across the 11 Western states that straddle or sit west of the Rocky Mountains, 37 separate private and public utilities operate portions of the grid.

States Reimagine Power Grids for Wind and Solar Future

This fragmented structure differs from the grid systems in Eastern and Midwestern states, where regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, coordinate and plan for energy needs across vast swaths of the country.

Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.

Under the current system, each utility is required by state public utility commissions to build enough power to meet peak energy demands. That could mean building gas plants that only turn on a few times a year during extreme heat waves.

As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity. Such agreements could also prevent the periodic shutdowns of wind and solar farms when they produce more energy than local utilities can use.

“We could be drawing on the solar resources from the Southwest during the day, and then in the evening the wind resources in Montana and Wyoming are a great benefit,” said Austin Scharff, senior energy policy specialist with the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We have a lot of hydro resources, and we can help make sure the regional grid stays balanced when those are needed.”

Some industry leaders say such trading would allow states to pull in cheap electricity from elsewhere, rather than building expensive new power plants.

“When you have this bigger market, not everybody has to build to their peak in the same way,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “Everybody’s able to share.”

Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities. Utilities spanning much of the West also transact through a real-time market that allows them to address pressing short-term demand issues. Some are poised to join a new day-ahead market that will conduct planning based on daily demand and production forecasts.

But some lawmakers and officials believe the region needs a larger vision that goes beyond moment-by-moment needs, a market that can plan interstate transmission lines and energy projects to serve the whole region in the decades to come.

“We’re facing really rapidly growing energy demand,” said Nevada Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “The best way for us to meet that is to effectively move energy all across the Western U.S. The only way we can do that is through an RTO.”

Watts sponsored a bill, enacted in 2021, that requires Nevada to join an RTO by 2030. Colorado also passed a law that year with a 2030 deadline for utilities to join an RTO.

“Any future is better than our status quo, which is 37 separate grids in the West,” said Chris Hansen, a former Democratic senator who sponsored the Colorado legislation. “We can lower costs and provide greater reliability if we’re sharing resources.”

Hansen now serves as CEO of La Plata Electric Association, an electric cooperative in southwestern Colorado.

A new market

The push for a West-wide market had always faced one major hurdle: Any market would likely include the massive geographical footprint and energy supply managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. As the West’s largest grid operator, CAISO manages the flow of electricity across most of the Golden State. It’s governed by a five-member board appointed by California’s governor, and other states were unlikely to sign up for a market in which they have no representation.

The law passed by California legislators last month allows for a new organization with independent governance from across the region to oversee Western energy markets.

“This legislation is a key reset and has been the largest sticking point in building a regional market,” said Amanda Ormond, managing director of the Western Grid Group, which advocates for a more efficient grid. “This is a primary concern of a lot of folks that has now been solved.”

Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

The law sets in motion a yearslong process that will task regional leaders with establishing the organization’s governance and navigating a series of regulatory procedures. The new market could be in place by 2028.

State leaders across the West say the California law is a long-awaited development.

“You get this really good benefit from being able to optimize across a larger footprint than an individual utility can,” said Tim Kowalchik, research director with the Utah Office of Energy Development. “Those resources can play really well together.”

Utah led a study in 2021, collaborating with other Western states, exploring the potential for energy markets in the region. State officials say the research has helped drive the current effort.

“It was fascinating how substantial the benefits were,” said Letha Tawney, chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. “The interdependence of the West started to become much more apparent, and it really changed the conversation.”

The study looked at a variety of market options and found that an RTO would have significant benefits, lowering costs for electricity customers and promoting clean energy. Based on the study’s projections, the market would produce roughly $2 billion in gross benefits per year, largely by saving utilities from building extra capacity.

Another study in 2022, conducted by a pair of consulting firms, found that an RTO would create as many as 657,000 permanent jobs and bolster the region’s economy.

While Western leaders say the potential benefits are massive, no states outside of Nevada and Colorado have committed to joining a regional RTO. State leaders say they’ll be watching carefully to see what emerges from the new California law. While the decision on joining the market will largely be left to individual utilities, state regulators can play a major role by directing them to conduct an economic analysis of such a move.

State sovereignty

The push for a regional market has also faced opposition from skeptics who fear it undermines states’ power to set their own energy and climate goals. Some point to Eastern governors’ frustration with PJM Interconnection, the RTO that manages the grid across a swath of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

“It’s very dangerous,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a California-based nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re giving up control of our sovereignty. Once a state’s in, it’s not the state that has the control.”

Some experts fear that states with significant coal or gas industries may be hesitant to join a market that could incentivize their utilities to import cheap solar power from elsewhere. On the flip side, some climate advocates in California are wary of plugging into a market that could support coal power from out of state.

“Some states are parochial-minded: ‘This is a California thing, and we don’t want anything to do with California,’” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit climate-focused group. “That one state’s government will not decide how a market will be operated, it’s a seismic shift in the industry.”

Trump’s bid to support coal could cost ratepayers billions, report finds

Backers of an RTO argue that it can incorporate states’ varying energy goals. They point to research showing that the market will support renewable power. But others fear merging fates with coal-heavy states could give federal regulators more leverage to intervene in favor of fossil-fuel power.

Even if Trump is out of office when the market comes online, the regulators he appoints to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will still be serving out their terms. Some believe FERC could set rules that require the new market to favor fossil fuel-powered resources.

“When you have a mixed market with a lot of coal plants, it creates opportunities for the Trump administration to rejigger the rules to favor coal,” said Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a California-based consumer advocacy group. “In another reality, this would have sounded like a hysterical concern, but it’s pretty obvious where [Trump’s appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] want to go.”

Freedman’s group pushed California lawmakers for protections that would have given states more flexibility to withdraw from the market, while also prohibiting “resource adequacy” mandates that could be used by the feds to prop up coal. While those elements were included in a Senate version of the bill, they were stripped from the Assembly bill that ultimately was passed.

Supporters of the bill say such concerns are overblown, and the new market is structured to avoid the pitfalls facing other RTOs.

“The simple economic fact is that right now clean energy resources are the cheapest in the world,” said Petrie-Norris, the law’s sponsor. “We’re going to see solar displacing dirty fuels rather than the reverse.”

Much depends on convincing states and utilities it’s in their best interests to join the market. The strength-in-numbers advantages of an RTO depend on widespread participation. While many Western leaders have long touted a region-wide market, the opportunity is arising at a time where energy has become a partisan issue.

Meanwhile, the long-awaited market emerging from California is facing new competition from the east. The Southwest Power Pool, an Arkansas-based RTO serving the middle of the country, is expanding its footprint in the West, with several utilities poised to join its day-ahead market.

“Anytime you have two neighboring utilities in different markets, you have seams that create a lot of friction and inefficiency,” said Rubin Shen, with the energy industry group. “Whether or not everybody can come together and be all-in on a full West-wide market, it’s too soon to tell.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/020325_intermountain_power_plant_06_7201760346364.jpg?h=34e43602&itok=BnWQv0m4,N,,2025-10-13 06:59:20.156020

Built from mass timber and packed with more than 40 distinct sustainability strategies, the site functions as a full-scale testbed to trial, analyse and refine greener ways of running a high-volume delivery network.

The goal is simple: keep packages moving at full speed, while learning how to cut emissions and waste across Amazon’s vast supply chain.

The facility, named DII5, stands out from Amazon’s typical concrete and steel distribution centres. It uses Southern Yellow Pine cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels and glulam beams for its structure - materials known for their low embodied carbon.

That’s the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions linked to building materials, from extraction to construction. Amazon claims this is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States.""

Inside and out, the Elkhart site combines design and function. Clerestory windows let in daylight along the delivery floor, a nod to energy-saving and employee wellbeing. The building uses bio-based insulation, salvaged wood desks and air-source heat pumps - an alternative to gas utilities.

These choices all contribute to a reduced operational footprint.

Kara Hurst, Amazon’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says the company is pushing to move quickly: “In climate action, we need to move fast.

""So our teams got creative and asked: ‘What if we created a real-world testing ground for some of the best sustainability initiatives, in one place?’ That’s exactly what we did at DII5, our brand-new mass timber delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana.”

Real-time testing in a live supply chain

Unlike typical pilot projects, this delivery station is live. Every day, more than125 EVs operate from the site, supported by 170 EV charging stations. Packages are still going out on time. That’s part of what makes DII5 different – it allows Amazon to test green strategies without halting operations.

“We're tracking multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity, etc,” adds Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s Vice President of Global Realty.

“We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.”

Water systems offer another angle of experimentation. DII5 features a rainwater recirculation system that captures and reuses water for restrooms, easing pressure on local infrastructure.

Outdoors, the site has a bio-retention pond for stormwater, permeable paving and more than 2,900 newly planted saplings. There are also more than 90 plant species planted specifically to support pollinators, adding a biodiversity component to the industrial landscape.

Daniel sees the facility as a platform for learning: “At the same time, it serves as a 'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing and resilient in a changing climate.

""The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction and operation of our spaces.”

Scaling the lessons across Amazon’s network

While the Elkhart site is new, its impact is meant to ripple across Amazon’s existing and future facilities.

By tracking performance in real time and under operational pressures, Amazon is building a reference point for retrofits as well as new construction.

The company already uses mass timber in its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia, but DII5 is designed with a different purpose: finding which strategies work at scale.

Daniel explains the long-term thinking behind it: “While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future buildings design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing buildings portfolio.”

From EV infrastructure and water systems to lighting and material choices, the site collects data across dozens of touchpoints. That data will help Amazon understand how to reduce the carbon footprint of its entire logistics operation without slowing down fulfilment.

Kara underlines that operations haven’t missed a beat: “These solutions can be changemakers – and the beauty of this approach is, it doesn't impact our operations at all. Packages are being delivered with the same reliability our customers expect and we still get to test our sustainability initiatives.”

At DII5, Amazon is not only keeping its supply chain moving - it’s figuring out how to make every link cleaner.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ba9d63b9b3e769bb0963b8213e014e54:03227ffc75f56270b4708a62126f729f/testing1.png.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:01:52.762639

To provide more timely data, the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) created a methodology using more aggregated quarterly data to estimate quarterly investment, employment, productivity and GVA (gross value added) for the Industrial Strategy growth-driving sectors (the ‘IS-8’ sectors).

Quarterly data is inherently volatile, and the granular estimates are likely to see notable revisions once the official annual data is released. Revisions will be more significant where the sectoral proportions of the economy shift significantly. Estimates may also be revised as DBT methodologies and data sources improve over time.

Estimating quarterly economic indicators for the IS-8

The IS-8 cannot be precisely mapped and measured by official statistics. ONS economic data uses the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, which does not fully capture the detail and fast-changing nature of the IS-8, meaning coverage varies across them (see Table 1). See initial definitions for the IS-8 on the SIC, which we will continue to use as our starting point.

Table 1: SIC-based definition coverage across the IS-8

Advanced Manufacturing Clean Energy Industries Creative Industries Defence Digital & Technologies Life Sciences Financial Services Professional and Business Services Proxy SIC-based definition Not easily represented by SIC, with no or partial coverage Well defined by SIC Not easily represented by SIC, with partial coverage Proxy SIC-based definition Not easily represented by SIC, with partial coverage Well defined by SIC Well defined by SIC

The SIC system is tiered, with increasing granularity down from SIC-1 to SIC-4. Where feasible we have mapped detailed SIC-4 against IS-8 sectors. The higher-level SIC classifications (that is, SIC-2) lack the necessary granularity to map easily against the IS-8, so we have used a list of SIC-4 codes mapped against IS-8 sectors to extract economic metrics.

Clean Energy cannot be proxied at all under the SIC system and is not captured here. Defence and Life Science only have partial coverage. Thus, overall IS-8 estimates will not fully reflect all 8 sectors. Estimates are at the IS-8 sector and not the frontier industry level for all frontier industries outlined in the Industrial Strategy white paper.

**Coverage varies between ONS investment datasets so we use multiple sources and merge them together to give full coverage.

DBT is publishing estimates of these 4 metrics to have a more timely understanding of how the IS-8 sectors are faring. However, the relevant data sets are published at SIC-2 level, which is not granular enough to extract data on all IS-8 sectors – which are defined at SIC-4 level.

Financial Services and Professional Business Services can be directly mapped at SIC-2 level and is directly input to the quarterly summary figures. But where this mapping is not feasible at SIC-2, we use apportionment to disaggregate the SIC-2 level economic data to the SIC-4 level data using another data set that does provide data at the SIC-4 level (ONS’s Annual Business Survey or the Inter-Departmental Business Register).

For output per worker data, we use the sector GVA data calculated using the apportionment method and divide this by ONS productivity jobs figures. The apportionment for ONS productivity jobs uses the same method as the GVA breakdown, using the latest Annual Business Survey (Non-financial business economy, UK: Sections A to S, 2025). This keeps the methodologies for the numerator and denominator consistent.

We use 2022 prices for GVA, investment and output per worker because this is the Chained Value Measures base year in the ONS GDP low level aggregates dataset.

For more timely employment statistics, we use Pay As You Earn Real Time Information (PAYE RTI) to source monthly employment. We use the latest available Inter-Departmental Business Register data (2024) to source SIC-4 employment shares for the IS-8, which are then applied on to the latest monthly PAYE RTI data.

DBT will update these estimates in future quarters with historic actuals and new sector mixes when more accurate or recent data is published by ONS.

The high-tech drinking water treatment plant at Veolia’s Stanton, Delaware, location is so new that none of the 800,000 pounds of granular activated carbon has yet to be replaced. Granular activated carbon has become a go-to way to remove toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, better known as PFAS, and other contaminants from drinking water sources.

But when that carbon is overloaded with contaminants that it pulls from drinking water sources, the hope is the carbon can be “regenerated” for reuse in the same plant instead of simply being incinerated or dumped in a landfill. Recharging and reusing spent carbon within the same system is a potentially novel way of dealing with the byproduct created by removing toxic PFAS from drinking water, a contamination issue that has become a worldwide public health challenge.

“We’re always analyzing the best available technologies and seeing what we can use for that specific compound,” said Gayla Fecher, engineering manager for Veolia’s Delaware operations. She said time will tell how much maintenance the system needs, and how well reused carbon media will work to remove contamination like that posed by PFAS.

Veolia’s new plant, Fecher said during a recent tour, also was designed to adapt to future technological or scientific advances — whether that means retrofitting certain equipment or treating for a completely different type of contamination. For now the carbon’s main enemy to capture are elusive and ubiquitous PFAS compounds.

Exposure to PFAS has been associated with a wide range of health effects, including kidney and testicular cancer, impacts to liver function, thyroid interference, decreased birth weight, and more. They’re called “forever chemicals” because they bioaccumulate in the body and they don’t break down naturally in the environment.

Across the Delaware River watershed and beyond, private companies and public utilities have been racing to meet a 2029 deadline to meet federal “maximum contaminant levels” (MCLs) for PFAS in drinking water, to protect public health from those impacts. Because PFAS have been used so widely for so long, previous studies have found the manmade compounds in the blood of upwards of 99 percent of Americans, including newborns.

In April 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the first time set specific MCLs for a handful of PFAS compounds, which would require drinking water providers to regularly test for PFAS and remove any contamination above that limit. But just over a year later, the Trump administration announced plans to rescind a portion of that regulation and extend the compliance deadline to 2031. The standards for PFOS and PFOA, two highly toxic compounds that were phased out of production over a decade ago, would remain in place. Limits on three other PFAS compounds and a mixture will be reconsidered, although that updated rulemaking has not yet been announced as of September.

As for the 14,000-plus other specific PFAS compounds that exist, there are no established nationwide limits for safe drinking water standards.

“There is a proliferation of ever-more confusing structural types of PFASs,” University of Pittsburgh associate professor Carla Ng said during a recent SciLine webinar, pointing to the challenges regulators face in addressing emerging contaminants. “Part of it is because they find new uses, and part of it is because one thing gets banned, something else comes along.”

It is possible, though, that requiring treatment for even just two types of PFAS could inadvertently lead to the removal of some other known or emerging contaminants as well, since the activated carbon doesn’t care about federal regulations when it catches contaminants in its pores. However, experts note the shorter-chain unregulated PFAS that have replaced the “legacy” PFAS aren’t captured quite as well by the activated carbon technologies being widely implemented.

“There’s always this huge delay from the science to the implementation,” Ng said. “Cleaning up what has already happened is difficult enough, but the fact that we’re not stopping the new parts means we’re going to have to deal with that in the future.”

A First State first

On a soggy summer day, three members of Congress — Sarah McBride of Delaware, along with Chrissy Houlahan and Mary Gay Scanlon, both of Pennsylvania — visited Veolia’s new, $35 million water treatment plant in northern Delaware, donning crisp, neon safety vests and helmets as they walked through aisles of towering white tanks filled with over 400 tons of activated carbon.

As fans buzzed, the federal lawmakers huddled closely around Veolia’s head local engineer as she explained how the system works.

Fecher showed where water comes into the 17,500-square food warehouse, moving through a series of pipes connected to 22-foot-tall tanks filled with porous activated carbon. As the water percolates through the tanks, PFAS can be adsorbed onto the carbon’s surface. The water in those tanks can be screened for PFAS at different depths to calculate how long it might take to get the contamination levels as low as possible. Current standards of 4 parts per trillion — equivalent to about one grain of sand in an Olympic swimming pool — are nearly as low as detection levels can reach.

If you think of the PFAS contamination in the water being treated here as a “grain of sand,” Fecher explained, each grain of sand must filter through about 80,000 pounds of activated carbon. That’s a lot of porous material to pass through, and the idea is that enough contamination will be caught that PFAS levels are low enough to be “nondetectable” and therefore safe for human consumption.

Veolia’s facility came online in March 2025 and serves about 120,000 residents and businesses, and is capable of treating up to 30 million gallons of water per day. It took about three years to construct, company officials said. By the time state and federal regulators were finalizing PFAS standards, the team at Veolia was already working on a conceptual design of the plant.

Back in her office and out of the heat, Fecher drew a diagram showing how the use of two-tank systems at the Veolia plant will elongate the life of the carbon that’s absorbing those forever chemicals. The first tank will absorb more pollution than the second, elongating the second tank’s lifespan, she explained. Still, PFAS-laden carbon will eventually need to be replaced.

But the system was also designed to adapt to future needs, whether that means different types of PFAS — like emerging short-chain or ether compounds that may not be captured as easily by activated carbon — or novel types of treatment media, or potentially addressing another unknown type of contamination.

“We have designed vessels that would be able to transition to these new media types, to meet new regulations,” Fecher said. “And we also installed a new half-a-million-dollar permanent pilot testing asset that we intend to use from now into perpetuity.”

Fecher noted Veolia was very deliberate about the cost of the system, too. It was able to get the carbon media costs down to about half of what it originally expected.

A watershed-wide challenge

Veolia’s new plant is the latest of several PFAS treatment facilities in Delaware. At least 10 utilities across the state are already treating for PFAS. In New Jersey, where state regulations already require drinking water providers to treat for PFAS, officials said in August that the state has issued 116 permits to 84 water systems to specifically address PFAS under state regulations.

“Other treatment facilities may have been constructed previously to address other contaminants that also address PFAS, but that number is not readily available,” New Jersey regulators said. “As an alternative, some public water systems may have taken certain sources out of service or connect to other public water systems, in lieu of installing treatment, which would also reduce exposure.”

Regulators also said that PFAS “is prolific across the state,” and that public water problems often occur at small- and medium-sized systems that rely on groundwater for drinking water.

Officials with the Delaware Office of Drinking Water said the 10 public water systems in the First State that now treat for PFAS use either granulated activated carbon — the technology of choice at Veolia’s Stanton plant — or ion exchange, which relies on charged ions to capture contaminated material much like a magnet.

While Delaware may now be able to tout one of the largest treatment plants of its kind in the state thanks to private investment, it was nearby New Jersey that was the first in the nation to institute drinking water standards for PFAS. State regulators there also recently announced a $2 billion settlement with DuPont and other chemical companies for its role in PFAS contamination in the state.

Because it was the first in the state to both investigate and regulate the problem, New Jersey helped build momentum to address PFAS and also contributed to the growing body of scientific evidence needed to support drinking water standards in other jurisdictions, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.

“State action is really important,” she said. “States are often able to move more quickly than the federal government. When the EPA finalized its PFAS rule last year, it was the most significant new drinking water standard in a generation.” In fact, it was the first time the EPA used new authority under the Clean Water Act to update federal rules, she added.

“I think New Jersey is an example of regulation working,” she said. The state now keeps a database of utilities with PFAS violations. The database also tracks the year individual water providers came back into compliance, indicating that dozens of systems are already removing the contaminants due to the state’s regulations on PFAS contamination.

Large, publicly regulated utilities like the Philadelphia Water Department, which relies on three treatment facilities to provide safe drinking water to 1.6 million people, still have their own hurdles to face. Despite the state being ahead of the curve when it came to developing regulations for PFAS, the city is still piloting approaches — instituting an actual treatment retrofit is years away from the making.

It will also cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, said Matthew Fritch, the city’s watershed protection program manager.

“We’re pleased to have two extra years because for such a large utility, it’s harder to do that kind of thing. Smaller facilities can do that much faster,” he said of the proposed changes to the federal PFAS rules. He said that, based on what it’s seen from its first pilot study, Philadelphia will likely retrofit its two drinking water plants with granulated carbon technology in the future. But it’s still waiting on the first report from the first pilot study — after that, the upgrade can begin to be designed, financed and planned.

Luckily, though, the surface waters Philadelphia customers rely on from the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers contain low levels of PFAS, levels below the state standard. It’s the more stringent federal standard that two facilities will need to treat for. The third, which is the only one that pulls from the Delaware, doesn’t need additional PFAS limits because the chemicals are not found at detectable levels.

“We’re continuing to look for where PFAS is entering our system,” he said, noting that monitoring is ongoing throughout rivers, streams and other point sources. “The PFAS does come from somewhere.”

It’s not just a problem for publicly owned utilities, either.

In Pennsylvania, a recent study found that about 18 percent of private wells in the state are contaminated with PFAS. Unlike public utilities, private wells are not subject to regulatory oversight; officials in New Jersey and Delaware are also working with homeowners to address PFAS contamination in private wells.

According to EWG’s interactive PFAS contamination map, there are dozens of sites and utilities in the Delaware River watershed that report varying levels of PFAS contamination, from heavily contaminated military sites like Delaware’s New Castle Air National Guard Base not far from Veolia’s plant, and the former naval base at Willow Grove, Pa., to drinking water systems serving rural residents in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and beyond.

Researchers have estimated that it could cost between $24 billion and $55 billion to meet the 2024 proposed drinking water standards across the country. That’s just for upgrading the publicly regulated utilities.

In New Jersey alone, regulators have estimated it will cost the state over $1 billion to implement the new pending federal PFAS standards. Just monitoring the state’s roughly 1,200 water systems for PFAS is expected to cost $2.1 million annually.

“Importantly, this estimate does not include the sustained operational and maintenance costs that will be necessary for affected systems to maintain treatment,” regulators added.

The EPA has estimated costs at about $1.5 billion annually for monitoring, communication and treatment technologies, but also notes that benefits will be equally offset by preventing an estimated 9,600 deaths and 30,000 serious illnesses linked to PFAS contamination, including cancers, heart attacks and strokes.

Uncertainty in the regs

To offset uncertainty at the federal level, multiple states have adopted their own PFAS regulations. In Delaware, these state-level MCLs are the same as what was proposed at the federal level. But a new law signed by Delaware’s governor also aims to increase transparency into the process by requiring reporting of impacted water systems in the next two years.

“It’s a first get at trying to address the issue with all the uncertainty at the federal level,” said Delaware State Sen. Darius Brown, the Delaware Democrat who sponsored the legislation.

He said the bill was part of an effort to answer questions impacted residents continue to have after learning that PFAS contamination from the nearby air base had contaminated their water supply. An exposure assessment by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry found that PFAS levels in New Castle residents’ blood was nearly 10 times the national level, likely from drinking contaminated water. More than half of the participants had at least seven different PFAS compounds in their blood.

Another law previously passed in Delaware also helps regulate PFAS by recognizing several compounds as hazardous substances, allowing the state to tackle clean-up responses when contamination is found.

Nearby, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have long had their own state-level PFAS standards to rely on in the absence of federal regulations. However, those state limits allow for higher levels of PFAS contamination than the EPA’s 2024 limits. Even the EPA’s original health advisory limits of 70 parts per trillion were significantly reduced by the time the rule was actually made – to just 4 parts per trillion for PFOS or PFOA.

EWG’s Benesh said leadership at the state level is going to be key in addressing PFAS when the current administration seems to be rolling back previous rules. That can be done in part, she said, by incorporating PFAS oversight in ongoing state-level regulation of facilities that might be releasing chemicals.

As for funding the clean-up, there are government-based funding sources through revolving drinking water funds as well as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, not to mention legal remedies sought against polluters. However, some federally funded programs like state revolving funds are facing proposed cuts from the current administration.

New Jersey’s head environmental regulator recently told Inside Climate News that since the state first conducted water sampling nearly 20 years ago, it has found that “… New Jersey is, in many ways, ground zero for some of the worst impacts of PFAS” due to DuPont’s manufacturing history there. He, and many others, wants to see more effort to capture any contamination that’s still out there before it enters water systems.

As municipalities across the country race to add the technologies and find the funding needed to remove PFAS from drinking water sources, some experts suggest that a different regulatory approach altogether may be needed to address the growing number of types of PFAS, particularly the short-chain compounds that replaced legacy ones like PFOA and PFOS.

“I would say we’re making some progress that’s important in having regulations, but the chemical-specific regulation is really difficult to be effective because it’s one-by-one and something else is going to be manufactured,” explained Ng, the engineering associate professor from Pitt. “There are some state-based regulations that are more about ‘don’t put them into consumer food items’ or ‘don’t put them into makeup’ is much more health protective and much more effective than something that’s looking at a specific chemical when we have tens of thousands of these out there now.”",https://delawarecurrents.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_3633-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 07:00:33.166353

The legal warning from Greenpeace comes after a lengthy correspondence and a face-to-face meeting with the Crown Estate management.
But in their reply, the estate’s managers have insisted that its legal duty is to maximise profit, not help the government deliver on its climate ambition.","Greenpeace UK has warned the Crown Estate that it is considering taking legal action unless the public body stops “monopoly profiteering” at the expense of bill payers and offshore wind developers. The warning comes ahead of a major auction where energy firms are expected to bid for plots of seabed on which to build new wind farms.

The Crown Estate manages all of the land and property belonging to the King, and provides revenue to the Treasury and the Royal Household. As the legal owner of the entire UK seabed outside of Scotland, it runs auctions to lease blocks of seabed to offshore wind developers, generating income from option fees and leasehold rents.

Greenpeace argues that the Crown Estate has exploited its monopoly position to charge hefty fees for leases of the seabed. It alleges that this has led to a pricing system that has massively boosted the estate’s profits, as well as the pay of its executives and the Royal Household’s official income, while driving higher costs for the wind power sector and energy bill payers.

The campaign group is calling for a review of the way seabed auctions are run and of the option fees that wind developers must pay. It argues that the current system risks loading unnecessary costs onto energy bills twice – both through higher option fees and by incentivising wind farms in Scotland, where fees are capped. As energy demand is higher in England, the power generated in Scotland sometimes needs to be carried south, and when that’s not possible, wind turbines are paid to switch off.

Greenpeace UK co-executive director Will McCallum said: “The Crown Estate should be managing the seabed in the interest of the nation and the common good, not as an asset to be milked for profit and outrageous bonuses. We should leave no stone unturned in looking for solutions to lower energy bills that are causing misery to millions of households. Given how crucial affordable bills and clean energy are to the government’s agenda, the Chancellor should use her powers of direction to ask for an independent review of how these auctions are run. If the problem isn’t fixed before the next round, we may need to let a court decide whether or not what’s happening is lawful.” [1]

In the first three auction rounds, the ‘option fee’ paid by bidders was capped. But in the fourth round that concluded in January 2023, the estate shifted to a price-uncapped competitive auction, leading to a dramatic increase in fees. As a result, the estate made over £1 billion in 2024/25 and its profits have skyrocketed, turning the seabed into its most lucrative source of revenue.

Meanwhile, King Charles’s official income will jump from £86.3 million this year to £132.1 million in 2025/6, almost exclusively because of the profits derived from offshore wind. At the same time, the Crown Estate Commissioner’s pay has risen fivefold from around £385,000 a year in the period 2015-2020 to a staggering £1.9m in 2024/25.

The legal warning from Greenpeace comes after a lengthy correspondence and a face-to-face meeting with the Crown Estate management. The campaign group is asking for an urgent review of the bidding process, and for the excess profits from the last auction round to be invested in marine recovery.

Writing to the Crown Estate Commissioners, Greenpeace has pointed out that the estate has a legal duty to both support the UK in meeting its climate targets and to remove the monopoly value from its seabed leasing. But in their reply, the estate’s managers have insisted that its legal duty is to maximise profit, not help the government deliver on its climate ambition.[2] This position appears to contradict what the then CEO of the Crown Estate, Roger Bight, told MPs about this legal duty in 2010: “So we are quite clear, it is spelt out that we cannot exploit our monopoly position.” [3]

Notes:

Greenpeace’s threat of legal action was first reported earlier today in the Financial Times.

[1] Under section 1(4) of the Crown Estate Act 1961, the Commissioners must comply with the direction of the Chancellor or Secretary of State: “The Commissioners shall comply with such directions as to the discharge of their functions under this Act as may be given to them in writing by the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Secretary of State, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Secretary of State in giving directions to the Commissioners under this subsection shall have regard to subsection (3) above, and before giving any such direction shall consult the Commissioners.”

[2] The Crown Estate was awarded the rights to wind energy in the seabed in 2004 by the previous Labour government seeking to rapidly increase offshore wind. In the Crown Estate Act 2025, the current Labour government added an amendment stating: “Commissioners must keep under review the impact of their activities on the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom”. In their replies to Greenpeace, the Crown Estate rejected that they have a duty to support decarbonisation and cheaper energy prices, arguing instead that their duty is to “manage and turn to account the assets under its stewardship” (i.e. to maximise profit).",https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GP0STR2TD_PressMedia-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 06:59:30.010588

Utilities can create load flexibility through a range of strategies and DERs.
Benefits of load flexibility Implementing load flexibility strategies offers numerous advantages: Optimization across different loads: Balancing various energy demands leads to a more stable and efficient grid.","Over the next decade, utilities anticipate an unprecedented rise in load growth, driven primarily by widespread consumer adoption of connected devices—such as electric vehicles—and AI-related power consumption by data centers. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently noted rapid increase in electricity generation due to this soaring demand.[i] In fact, AI is on course to account for almost half of the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030.[ii] During the same period, greater energy price volatility and expanding need for ancillary services associated with the accelerated rollout of renewable resources are expected to increase the marginal capacity cost of electricity. These dynamics highlight the urgent need for enhanced grid flexibility, particularly through customer-owned resources.

Load flexibility refers to the electric grid’s ability to adjust and manage energy consumption patterns in response to supply conditions, thereby enhancing grid stability and efficiency. This adaptability is crucial, as it allows utilities to balance demand and supply, integrate renewable energy sources, defer capital expenditures on new capacity, and reduce reliance on peaker plants—which are often more expensive, environmentally detrimental, and take years to permit and build.

Importance of load flexibility

The significance of load flexibility lies in its capacity to:

Optimize grid operations: By shifting or reducing energy usage during peak periods, utilities can alleviate stress on the grid, preventing outages and maintaining reliable service.

Integrate renewable energy: Load flexibility facilitates the incorporation of variable renewable energy sources—like wind and solar—by adjusting demand to match supply fluctuations.

Support economic efficiency: Reducing peak demand can defer or reduce the need for new infrastructure investments, leading to cost savings for both utilities and consumers.

Strategies for enhancing load flexibility

The good news is that utilities have several strategies to choose from to enhance load flexibility. These range from using education and behavioral science to influence customers to act, all the way to implementing grid management solutions—like distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) to manage and optimize distributed energy resources (DERs) both in front of and behind the meter. These strategies include:

Behavioral demand response

Behavioral demand response (BDR) programs engage customers through personalized communications that encourage reduced energy usage during peak demand periods. These communications provide energy insights, tips, and prompts to help customers adjust their usage patterns. For instance, during a multi-day heat wave last year, PGE reported customer actions resulted in the largest electricity demand-shift in the company’s history.[iii] [iv]

Behavioral load shaping

Behavioral load shaping programs communicate with customers to educate them on time-of-use (TOU) rate plans, highlighting optimal times to use energy to save money. Providing personalized insights helps customers shift their energy consumption to off-peak hours, thereby reducing peak demand.

Peak time rebates

Peak time rebates provide monetary incentives for customers to reduce energy usage during critical peak periods. This approach has demonstrated reliable peak savings and increased customer satisfaction. For example, during a PJM emergency event in July 2025, Oracle Opower delivered 1,187,086 communications across email, text, IVR, and push channels. This supported three utility clients and helped customers take action when the grid needed it most.

Real-time optimization and DER management

Implementing real-time optimization techniques—such as Volt/VAR optimization and DER management—enhances distribution network efficiency and reliability. These methods involve demand management systems (DMSs) and DERMSs to automate adjustments to grid operations, improving safety and accommodating the integration of DERs.

Where to start

As the diagram below illustrates, these choices range in resource requirements to implement and the number of DERs they can involve in their forecasting and controllability.

Figure 1. Utilities can create load flexibility through a range of strategies and DERs.

Utilities who want to inject more load flexibility into their networks can implement programs and systems that best fit their generation mix and technology footprint. This means that they don’t have to do everything all at once. They can plan future options to align with their roadmap and forecasted demand.

For example, they can start by helping their customers act in ways that shift and/or reduce demand. Employing behavior change to add load flexibility is a “win-win for both the utility and the customer,” says Vanessa Richter, Energy Industry Solutions Expert, Oracle Opower. “These programs have low barriers to entry, increase customer engagement and satisfaction, and utilities get real results at scale.”[v]

Adding extra DER management and forecasting capabilities can align with utilities adopting advanced distribution management systems (AMDSs) and DERMSs, while also building on customer engagement from the behavior change approaches. The utility can then encourage these customers to participate in DERMS offerings with higher participation and program retention.

Benefits of load flexibility

Implementing load flexibility strategies offers numerous advantages:

Optimization across different loads: Balancing various energy demands leads to a more stable and efficient grid.

Co-optimization of front-of-the-meter (FTM) and behind-the-meter (BTM) resources: Utilizing all available resources ensures the most economical dispatch and operation.

Time-scale management: Effectively managing energy storage solutions, like batteries, allows for rapid response to demand fluctuations.

DER monetization: Enabling DERs to participate in different markets (capacity, day-ahead, real-time) creates additional revenue streams and reduces utilities’ system costs.

Value stacking: Leveraging DERs for both grid support and selling excess capacity enhances revenue and decreases utilities’ overall system expenses.

Load shifting and peak shaving: Adjusting energy consumption patterns reduces peak demand, deferring the need for new infrastructure investments.

Reduced cost of power: Accurate forecasting and demand management decrease the reliance on expensive peaker plants, leading to lower energy costs for consumers and utilities alike.

The bottom line

To summarize, “load flexibility reduces the cost of power and increases affordability,” says Arun Nimmala, Global Head, Oracle DERMS and OT Solutions, Oracle Utilities. “In addition, the ability to forecast across all types of DERs reduces the need for reserves and the amount of peaker plant generation, while creating new revenue streams in energy markets.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_77yILXkV1qNo30Q-x4e4BLjIr3I7m8xSnPzERINz68/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9zaHV0dGVyc3RvY2tfMjE5MzE5MDAwNS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-13 07:00:14.423520

Trump’s decision to pull the US out of a global system for addressing the climate crisis could be the window of opportunity we were waiting for.
It must be made clear first and foremost that mitigating the effects of the climate crisis is an opportunity for innovation.","The climate crisis, Donald Trump told the UN last month, is “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”. With these words the US president rejected the international scientific consensus and evidence that we can all check daily with a basic thermometer. He has also announced he is withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015 by 195 UN countries. The US joins an axis of deniers including Yemen, Iran and Libya, countries that signed the agreement but never ratified it.

Paradoxically, Trump’s reversal provides an opportunity for others to advance the climate agenda: to sketch out the blueprint of a possible new world order without the US, even if Washington was the architect of the old one.

A new arrangement could even emerge at the UN climate summit, Cop30, in Brazil next month. Success will depend on the leadership capability of an unlikely duo: the host country, which is one of the founding Brics nations, and the EU, still the core political community in a fractured western alliance.

There is almost always a grain of truth in what Trump claims. He is not totally wrong when he accuses the UN of being toothless. As he said in his speech: “All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up.”

In 1995, Angela Merkel, then the German environment minister, opened the first Cop in Berlin, saying that global warming was “the greatest political challenge”. And yet, after 30 Cops and 30 years, the numbers seem to suggest that decades of “words” have produced only more hot air.

In 1995, global C02 emissions stood at 23.5bn tonnes; 30 years later, the level has reached a new record of 38bn tonnes. When Merkel tried for the first time to forge an agreement on gradually stopping the use of fossil fuels, 85% of total energy consumption came from oil, gas and coal. Today, that has only dropped to 80%. More worryingly, whereas we all accepted 10 years ago in Paris that the rise in global temperature must be kept well below 2C above preindustrial levels so as not to lose control of the “weather machine”, in Europe, according to the Copernicus observatory, we have already passed the 2.4C mark.

Clearly, we are failing. Multilateralism is in crisis and this may even be one of the reasons behind the appeal of populists such as Trump. But the rest of the world now has a (final) chance to show that “global” problems can still be solved collectively. Trump’s decision to pull the US out of a global system for addressing the climate crisis could be the window of opportunity we were waiting for. An opportunity somewhat like the one EU countries took advantage of in 2020 when they produced an unprecedented agreement on tackling the economic damage done by the pandemic. Consensus on issuing common debt was possible only because the UK, traditionally a sceptic on the matter, had removed itself from the EU.

But what exactly is to be done at the next US-free Cop? Some of the most difficult issues facing Cop30 risk getting lost in bitter negotiations: the “loss and damage” facility, for example, meant to compensate poor countries for climate-related disasters. Other discussions – such as that on the energy transition – seem paralysed by opposition from interest groups such as farmers, homeowners or European carmakers, who fear they will have to foot the bill.

The objective is still the right one, but the language, the metrics and the incentives must change. It must be made clear first and foremost that mitigating the effects of the climate crisis is an opportunity for innovation. The debate can’t permanently be about who bears the costs and who has the right to compensation. This is ultimately about an investment that will make our societies more resilient to global heating and less dependent on an energy model that is unstable and expensive.

No less important is the method we use to resolve such global challenges. The Cops, for instance, have a result/cost ratio which nobody could call “sustainable”. Do these conferences have to move to a different country every year? How about basing the meeting permanently in one or a small number of places, each focusing on a handful of specific challenges?

Perhaps it is time to refocus Cop’s mission: today, it involves diplomats negotiating frantically on the wording of a final communique, along with thousands of side events that have no impact on decision-making. It could instead focus on solutions to climate-related problems drawing on best practice globally, so that policymakers can identify how to scale up what works.

Two parties are key to the next Cop. Brazil, as the host country, needs a breakthrough. And the EU, which, as the part of the world most vulnerable to trade wars and no longer able to rely on the US, desperately needs new friends.

Brazil and the EU must come together around a pragmatic agenda. Alongside them should be India, Canada, the UK, Australia (the host of Cop31) and, yes, China. These seven may not be like-minded on many vital issues, but they still represent about half of the world’s emissions, population and GDP. I would argue that if they struck an agreement most of the other parties would follow.

The US under the influence of Trump and his Maga followers is missing in action and will be for the foreseeable future, despite sharing the same planetary and climatic conditions – including life-threatening wildfires and blizzards – as the rest of us. This is a grave mistake, but there is at least now an opportunity to shape a world that can function more efficiently without a hegemonic power. With the climate debate stuck at a crossroads, we must seize it.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/775f1cf985e5db35d1e46a7222d131ee0c43baae/0_26_3224_2579/master/3224.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c7348179655b69708f234572d0446b7c",N,,2025-10-13 05:59:44.489638

""Modern, industrial heat pump technologies are available and will soon be ready to replace thousands of low- and medium-temperature combustion-based boilers in the coming years,"" the ALA stated in its report.
""This transition can generate significant local health benefits by delivering cleaner and more efficient heat for industrial settings.
Educational efforts, policies, and investments in more efficient industrial technologies will yield major benefits for American communities and American manufacturers.""","A new study from the American Lung Association revealed the potential cost and health savings if U.S. manufacturers replaced thousands of industrial boilers with heat pumps.

According to the report, summarized by Canary Media, a gradual transition to heat pumps would save Americans $1.1 trillion in public health costs and avoid 77,200 pollution-inflicted deaths from 2030 to 2050. The publication explained that heat pumps use electricity to transfer heat instead of relying on dirty energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which contribute to the heating of the planet and health-harming air pollution.

States with higher concentrations of people living near industrial pollution sources stand to benefit the most, according to the analysis. Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina were identified as the states with the biggest estimated health benefits, with $107 billion, $82 billion, and $68 billion in projected savings, respectively. Twenty-three other states would save at least $25 billion each.

But heat pumps aren't just a solution for industry. Homeowners can implement these systems in their homes, which can save them money on utility bills. Heating and cooling are responsible for 60% of household emissions, according to Rewiring America, which adds that heat pumps are two to three times more energy-efficient than most traditional heating systems that rely on dirty energy sources. For instance, Mitsubishi, one of several companies that offer home heat pump systems, states that its devices are between 160% and 390% more efficient than gas-powered furnaces.

One other benefit of switching to heat pumps — whether at the industrial or household level — is that it cuts planet-heating pollution. Plus, this equipment delivers both heating and cooling in one package, and some heat pump users say these devices even distribute the heat in a way that feels more comfortable.

""I noticed … how different the 'comfort' feels compared to a regular furnace,"" one Redditor wrote. ""It's not blasting hot air all at once, but more of a steady, even warmth. Took me a few days to get used to, but now I actually prefer it.""

While it may seem overwhelming to find the right system for you, Mitsubishi can connect you with trained professionals in its trusted network who will help you install an efficient heat pump system.

The potential cuts come shortly after the Department of Energy announced nearly $8 billion in reductions to broader federal energy programs. The affected projects include $50 million grants for direct air capture hubs, systems designed to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. One of these hubs, Project Cypress, is situated in Johnson’s district.

It remains uncertain which projects will ultimately be terminated or when official announcements will be made. Some companies participating in these initiatives have not yet received formal communication from the federal government regarding their funding. Christoph Gebald, co-CEO of Climeworks, a company involved with Project Cypress, said market rumors have circulated, but the Department of Energy has not issued a definitive decision.

Direct air capture technology relies on chemical processes to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The captured carbon can either be stored underground or used in industrial products, such as cement. Advocates argue that developing these hubs is essential, particularly in oil- and gas-producing states like Texas and Louisiana, where they could help reduce emissions while supporting local industries.

Economic and Political Implications

Louisiana’s Republican Governor, Jeff Landry, has publicly supported the state’s project and encouraged federal lawmakers to safeguard it from any potential cuts. Supporters emphasize the economic impact these initiatives could have, highlighting billions in investment and thousands of new jobs tied to the emerging carbon removal sector. Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, described the hubs as a “huge economic boon.” Similarly, Giana Amador of the Carbon Removal Alliance and Ben Rubin of the Carbon Business Council warned that withdrawing funding could harm local economies and undermine U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly growing industry.

Despite mounting concern from stakeholders, the Energy Department has maintained that its review of projects is ongoing. Spokesperson Ben Dietderich stated that no new determinations have been made beyond previously announced reductions, emphasizing that each project is undergoing an individualized review of awards made under the previous administration.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the review, confirming that potential grant cancellations are being considered across states, regardless of political affiliation. He stressed that the funding decisions are not tied to the current government shutdown and are not aimed solely at projects in Democratic-leaning states, countering claims made by White House officials suggesting political bias. “We’ve announced project cancellations before that in both red and blue states, and as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said.

The full list of funding decisions has yet to be released, but Wright indicated that details will be made public in the coming weeks. In the meantime, project advocates and local officials continue to lobby the Department of Energy to maintain support for these carbon removal initiatives, citing both environmental and economic benefits.",https://www.politicalfiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-2689109_640-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 04:00:02.139165

But other OCED picks garnered more public applause — and supported industries that President Donald Trump had flagged as priorities.
“These clean energy projects were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and represent the will of Congress,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, said in a recent statement to Canary Media.
A spreadsheet of the cuts lists 11 newly affected OCED projects totaling nearly $2.5 billion, including for two major hydrogen projects planned in the Pacific Northwest and California.
Additionally, the energy agency said it has started tapping OCED’s authority to make some new grants for Trump’s favorite energy source: coal-fired power plants.","The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was supposed to be a launchpad for ambitious projects to help America lead the way on cleaner power and manufacturing. Now it’s been reduced to a shell of itself.

As the Trump administration slashes spending and fires workers across the federal government, the U.S. Department of Energy has emerged as one of the hardest-hit agencies — and perhaps no other of its divisions has been singled out as deliberately as OCED.

It’s a dramatic reversal for the four-year-old office. During the Biden administration, Congress endowed it with nearly $27 billion to try to scale up cutting-edge technologies that could curbplanet-warming pollution from industrial facilities and power plants. Trump officials have in recent months hollowed out the office, canceling billions in previously issued awards for everything from low-carbon chemical manufacturing to rural energy resiliency, while also dismissing over three-quarters of its employees.

The situation is best summarized by the budget the White House has requested for OCED for the next fiscal year: $0.

Experts and insiders warn that the tumult within OCED and the DOE more broadly is eroding the private sector’s trust in the federal government and its ability to drive energy innovation.

“The administration has really created a chilling effect on the willingness of future early-stage technology developers to work with the Department of Energy,” said Advait Arun, a senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, a nonprofit think tank.

Ultimately, that will stifle investment not only in the clean energy sectors the Trump administration dislikes but in those it has championed as well, such as advanced nuclear and geothermal. Former OCED staffers and contractors, who were granted anonymity to speak freely, told Canary Media that the disruption is a major setback for America’s efforts to launch the world’s next generation of energy technologies and industries.

“We are eliminating ourselves as a leader in the clean energy space, especially for the industrial complex,” one person said. ​“What I’m seeing is China is about to slip right into that position. Just logically and economically, I don’t understand the steps that are being taken.”

The rise and fall of OCED

Congress created OCED in December 2021 to help deploy first-of-a-kind projects at commercial scale. The idea was for the government to absorb some of the risks and provide early capital to usher companies across the valley of death that lurks between promising research pilots and real-world operations that can move the needle on decarbonization.

The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law provided OCED with about $21 billion over five years to scale up emerging technologies like small modular reactors and long-duration energy storage, and to advance ambitious ​“hubs” for producing hydrogen fuel and capturing carbon dioxide from the sky and smokestacks. In 2022, Congress gave OCED an additional $5.8 billion through the Inflation Reduction Act to help decarbonize U.S. manufacturing of materials like steel, cement, and chemicals.

“A lot of this stuff is a chicken-and-egg situation, where the private sector doesn’t want to come in [and invest] yet because it’s not proven,” said Zahava Urecki, a senior policy analyst with the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Energy Program.

“But we need the technology to go through this [demonstration] process in order to make sure it becomes proven, so that eventually we can have this in society,” she added. ​“And that’s where the federal government plays a key role.”

Over the course of three years, the office selected 116 projects in 42 states to receive over $25 billion in federal funding. For most awards, participating companies were required to cover at least 50% of total costs themselves — meaning the office expected its portfolio to spur nearly $65 billion in private investment, in addition to creating potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Among the biggest winners were seven regional hydrogen hubs and two major direct air capture initiatives that would remove CO2 directly from the sky. The choices were not always broadly celebrated, and critics raised concerns that the hydrogen and carbon-capture initiatives in particular would do more harm than good for the climate by propping up unproven, energy-intensive projects involving fossil-fuel companies.

But other OCED picks garnered more public applause — and supported industries that President Donald Trump had flagged as priorities. In 2024, the office selected Cleveland-Cliffs for an award of up to $500 million to begin lower-carbon steel production in Middletown, Ohio, the hometown of Vice President JD Vance. Another manufacturer, Century Aluminum, got up to $500 million to help it build the nation’s first new aluminum smelter in decades, which would be powered by carbon-free electricity.

Former OCED staffers said they attempted to brief the incoming Trump administration on the office’s portfolio and to explain how they could support the president’s stated goals of boosting ​“American energy dominance” and ​“advancing innovation.”

However, from the time Trump took office on Jan. 20, ​“It became pretty clear that it didn’t really matter,” a former employee said.

It was quickly evident that Trump would, in fact, be adopting the right-wing policy platform Project 2025 after trying to distance himself from it on the campaign trail. The blueprint — which outlines ways to erase federal spending — called for eliminating ​“all DOE energy demonstration projects, including those in OCED,” in order to avoid ​“distorting the market and undermining energy reliability.”

For one staffer, ​“it all started crumbling” on Day 1, when the White House issued an executive order to halt federal work on ​“diversity, equity, and inclusion” — a measure that affected OCED’s grant recipients. Under former President Joe Biden, the office required participants to create community benefit plans to ensure the billions in taxpayer dollars went to projects that included neighbors in the planning process and supported local economies. Under Trump, the strategy became a liability.

A blitz of federal funding freezes and layoffs — and court reversals and injunctions — then ensued, creating chaos across federal agencies and for all the outside companies that hold or held government contracts. In late January, the White House extended federal workers a ​“deferred resignation offer” that would allow people to resign from their jobs and go on leave with pay through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Few OCED staffers initially took the offer. But after several months of chaos, about 77% of workers at OCED signed the deal when the White House extended it again in April. Insiders say that figure is likely even higher now. Across the DOE, some 3,200 employees within the agency’s roughly 17,000-person workforce opted to leave.

“That’s when folks at OCED actually started to realize it was going to be personnel changes that would first impact the projects, and not the program cuts,” according to a former employee.

Funding cuts, real and rumored

On May 15, about a month after the staff exodus, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the DOE would begin scrutinizing federal grants to ​“identify waste of taxpayer dollars.”

The agency started requesting additional information for 179 awards totaling over $15 billion, with a focus on large-scale commercial projects. Wright claimed that these awards were ​“rushed out the door, particularly in the final days of the Biden administration,” and required further review to ensure that individual projects were ​“financially sound and economically viable.”

Less than 3% of the over $25 billion in OCED’s awards portfolio had actually been paid to projects as of March 31, in part because larger grants were meant to be doled out in tranches over a long development timeline, according to EFI Foundation, a nonpartisan organization led by Ernest Moniz, who served as energy secretary during the Obama administration.

Project developers interviewed by EFI claimed that, contrary to Wright’s statement, OCED’s ​“due diligence was more rigorous than what private-sector investors would conduct” and that, rather than undergo the office’s laborious process, ​“faster decisions would have better aligned with developer timelines,” the foundation said in a June report.

Wright didn’t wait long to begin nixing projects. In late May, he announced the termination of 24 awards issued by OCED totaling over $3.7 billion, including funding for carbon capture and sequestration and projects within the office’s Industrial Demonstrations Program that aimed to reduce emissions from iron, cement, glass, and chemicals production.

“These clean energy projects were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and represent the will of Congress,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, said in a recent statement to Canary Media. Heinrich and other congressional Democrats sent a letter to Wright on Sept. 9 accusing the DOE of undertaking a ​“haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven” cancellation process.

More funding cuts arrived earlier this month, when the DOE said it was slashing 321 grants for projects almost entirely in states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. A spreadsheet of the cuts lists 11 newly affected OCED projects totaling nearly $2.5 billion, including for two major hydrogen projects planned in the Pacific Northwest and California. The October list also repeats five OCED-backed initiatives that first appeared in the May announcement.

Project developers have said they’re appealing the award terminations and are in continued talks with the DOE. Still, it’s unclear how much capacity the office has anymore to helm those discussions.

Wright said in an Oct. 3 interview that more cancellations would follow, and early last week rumors swirled about a second spreadsheet that appeared to outline deeper cuts for carbon-removal projects, hydrogen hubs, and other OCED projects. The nature of the list remains unclear, but if it proves to be a signal of cuts to come, it would cancel another $6.1 billion in awards from OCED.

The project areas that have yet to be cut — or to appear on any potential hit lists — include advanced nuclear energy and critical minerals. Additionally, the energy agency said it has started tapping OCED’s authority to make some new grants for Trump’s favorite energy source: coal-fired power plants. Should the office shutter, these awards would likely be managed by other divisions within the DOE.

In the case of cement and steel, demand for low-carbon materials is growing within U.S. and global markets as tech giants look to build less carbon-intensive data centers, and as state governments and European and Chinese regulators work to rein in industrial pollution. Still, losing grants — and the DOE’s seal of approval — will undoubtedly make it harder and more expensive for companies to raise private capital for commercial-scale projects. Stifling the DOE’s role as a gatherer and publisher of real-world lessons could further slow progress, Kizer said.

“The potential for breakthrough across different energy sectors is so significant,” he said of OCED’s work, noting that ​“a relatively small investment from taxpayers could have an enormous benefit to taxpayers over time,” in terms of delivering cleaner, more reliable energy. ​“Who says no to that?”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/DOE-Building-shot.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=83762acaa291f3014768c1b852f1b060,N,,2025-10-13 03:59:12.767018

Then this August the Trump administration announced that it would cut off $679 million in federal funding for offshore wind ports.
The move was part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attacks on offshore wind, the impacts of which are being felt far beyond the nascent sector.
There was no organized opposition to the wind port idea beyond occasional grumbling by Facebook commenters, she said.
When Trump was elected in 2024, some port supporters held out hope that the project would escape the president’s well-known hostility to offshore wind.","Barbara Kelley remembers when her car and windows were routinely coated with a thin film of coal dust that had drifted over from the power plant on the edge of her neighborhood in Salem, Massachusetts. She remembers the noise as a conveyor belt lifted the coal into the building. She also remembers how pleased she was when the community started to discuss the possibility of building an offshore wind terminal on the site when the plant eventually closed.

“The coal plant — it worked, it gave us energy, but it was time to change,” Kelley said. ​“My reaction was, having a wind port is part of having wind energy — and that’s a good thing.”

In the years since the coal plant shut down in 2014, Kelley and many other community members have worked to promote the goal of transforming part of the property into a staging ground where wind turbine blades, tower sections, and nacelles can be prepared for transport to offshore construction sites south of Cape Cod and north in the Gulf of Maine. The vision was to turn Salem Harbor, one of the country’s oldest ports, into a linchpin of the then-burgeoning offshore wind industry and provide an economic boost to some of Salem’s most disadvantaged residents.

Last year, that dream seemed close at hand. City and state leadership had embraced the idea. The state had promised a hefty investment, and the Biden administration had awarded the project a sizable grant. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the development in August 2024, and operations were expected to begin in 2026.

Project developer Crowley had agreed to pour nearly $9 million into a community benefits agreement that included job training, childcare, emergency services, and local sustainability and resilience efforts. Planners estimated construction and operations would create hundreds of jobs. And the whole process of bringing the idea to life gave community members a sense of agency and hope for their city.

Then this August the Trump administration announced that it would cut off $679 million in federal funding for offshore wind ports. The move was part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attacks on offshore wind, the impacts of which are being felt far beyond the nascent sector. Now, like those in so many communities across the country, the people of Salem find themselves facing the fallout of national political priorities, and wondering whether more than a decade of work will ever bear fruit.

“I feel like we’re all a little bit in the dark still,” said Lucy Corchado, a local activist who was part of the group that negotiated the community benefits agreement. ​“I hope we hear some good news, but I’m not sure that’s going to happen.”

The path to an offshore wind port

Community advocates first started floating the idea of building a wind port on Salem Harbor roughly 15 years ago. At the time, plans were underway to build a commercial wind farm off Cape Cod, and the coal plant’s closure looked likely. The advocates saw a promising future for the large industrial waterfront parcel in what seemed to be a growing energy sector.

Once the epicenter of the spice trade in early America, Salem has a deepwater port that today serves mostly recreational boaters, tourist outings, and the occasional cruise ship. Though the city is home to a hospital, university, and thriving hospitality sector, it also has a median household income well below the average in most surrounding towns and statewide.

When the owner of the coal plant proposed building a natural gas–burning facility on the site, activists from Salem Alliance for the Environment, or SAFE, were skeptical of replacing one fossil fuel with another. However, they decided not to oppose the plan for a new, smaller plant and to instead push for the rest of the property to be used for an offshore wind port that could both contribute to the decarbonization of the grid and create new opportunities for local residents.

“It wasn’t that we were really supportive of the gas plant, but we had bigger dreams of a wind port coming into town,” said SAFE founder Patricia Gozemba. ​“Our dream played out.”

In 2022, then-Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, announced the state would make a $75 million investment in the port, and the project was also awarded a $34 million grant from the federal Port Infrastructure Development Program. Two years later, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center bought 42 acres of the former coal plant property, with the intention of leasing it to energy and marine developer Crowley. The City of Salem acquired five adjacent acres.

The plans enjoyed widespread support in the city.

“We’re a uniquely progressive community,” said SAFE executive director Bonnie Bain. There was no organized opposition to the wind port idea beyond occasional grumbling by Facebook commenters, she said.

A seat at the table

As negotiations between Crowley and the city got underway, SAFE and other groups started to worry that, despite their longstanding advocacy for the project, important community input was missing from the process.

“This wasn’t just a wind port — it was an investment in the community,” Bain said. ​“We want to make sure that when we build projects that they enhance the community.”

Advocates raised their voices, submitting testimony for state and local proceedings, attending planning board meetings, and hosting educational webinars about offshore wind. In 2023, SAFE and several Salem neighborhood associations and civic groups formed a coalition to ask for a seat at the bargaining table as the city and developer hammered out the community benefits agreement.

The coalition was determined to make sure that the project didn’t harm nearby residents and created opportunities for some of the city’s disadvantaged populations. The group met once a week — Thursdays at 4 p.m. — for a year to discuss strategy, write letters to the media, and plan for local and state meetings. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo agreed to include two coalition members — Kelley, representing the Historic Derby Street neighborhood adjacent to the planned port, and Corchado, representing The Point, a largely immigrant, lower-income neighborhood nearby — in the community benefit negotiations.

“We kind of pushed our way to the discussion table to make sure they heard what we were looking for,” Corchado said.

The parties struck a deal that included a range of measures. The city’s public schools were set to receive $40,000 annually for technical and vocational education programs and another $50,000 per year to expand prekindergarten childcare to help parents attend job training. Crowley also committed to offer paid apprenticeships and internships, help graduating students find jobs in the industry, and fund scholarships for local workers to access relevant training opportunities.

When Trump was elected in 2024, some port supporters held out hope that the project would escape the president’s well-known hostility to offshore wind. Corchado, however, was concerned from the beginning.

“We were so far along and the funding has already been secured. It was like, maybe it’s not going to be that bad,” she said. ​“But, yeah … it’s what I was worried about.”

The news on Aug. 29 that the federal funding would be terminated was an enormous disappointment for proponents. It also left them with questions about whether the lost funds would scuttle the plan entirely, force the developer to change course, or merely delay implementation. Crowley will say only that it is reviewing the action and determining next steps. The city of Salem is also figuring out what to do now.

“We are still working to pursue all avenues to address the funding termination,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. ​“That includes working to get it restored or, failing that, looking at how we could revise the project plan to account for the loss of what was around 10% of the expected construction costs for the port.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Salem-Gas-Plant.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=bee66d785b2daea8e5b2bf997a7cdc04,N,,2025-10-13 03:59:23.513331

Despite the earlier-than-expected conclusion of EV tax credits, Aldred remains optimistic that investing in EV technology will still be worth it.","The electric vehicle market may face a bumpy road ahead, following the end of U.S. federal tax credits for new and used EVs last month.

What's happening?

On Sept. 30, the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and plug-in hybrids and the $4,000 credit for used ones expired. In a recent article, EnergySage took a look at what this could mean for the EV market. An objective, independent expert on all things solar, EnergySage helps consumers discover the right solar systems for their homes with its free, easy-to-compare quotes.

""The market is about to flip dramatically. … Expect a very different landscape,"" EnergySage wrote prior to the Sept. 30 deadline, citing several auto experts, including General Motors North America senior vice president Duncan Aldred.

""There's no doubt we'll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end September 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize,"" Aldred said in a statement. ""We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won't overproduce.""

Why is this important?

The electric vehicle boom has benefited consumers in numerous ways. For one, drivers don't have to worry about paying high gas prices or shelling out money for oil changes. All in all, EV owners can save around $1,500 per year on fuel and maintenance.

Increased EV adoption has also contributed to cleaner, healthier communities, as EVs don't produce tailpipe emissions linked to childhood asthma, heart disease, and other complications.

Installing solar panels enables drivers to enhance these perks. Charging with a home solar system is significantly cheaper than relying on public charging stations or the grid, and photovoltaic panels don't release any planet-warming emissions when operating.

EnergySage helps the average household save $10,000 on solar installation by mapping available incentives in each state. Acting now could net you thousands in long-term savings with federal solar credits expiring Dec. 31.

If buying solar panels isn't in your budget, Palmetto offers leasing plans that require $0 down. Regardless of how you choose to go solar, electrifying your home provides further savings. If you're considering an energy-efficient heat pump, Mitsubishi has a variety of options.

What do changes to EV credits mean for consumers?

Despite the earlier-than-expected conclusion of EV tax credits, Aldred remains optimistic that investing in EV technology will still be worth it. ""We believe GM can continue to grow EV market share,"" Aldred said, per EnergySage. Recently, GM also announced a partnership with Pilot to bring more EV charging stations to rural areas and support coast-to-coast travel.

Meanwhile, drivers who want an EV may still be able to snag one at a favorable price point. Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying website Edmunds, suggested to CNN that manufacturers may start to lower prices, introduce better financing, or offer cash-back deals to move inventory.

""If you already can't sell the vehicles at current prices, there's no way you are going to sell them at today's prices with this credit going by the wayside,"" Drury said as the deadline loomed.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ev-dealership-1450302223.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 03:59:03.345748

The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has designed a multiport converter that plugs directly into the power grid. In simple terms, it bypasses the heavy, expensive transformers normally needed to step electricity up and down before it reaches a car.

Conventional high-powered chargers require multiple conversion stages, making them more costly and less efficient. ""Our invention simplifies this process and offers a 3-5% improvement in energy efficiency,"" said the corresponding author of the study, Kaushik Basu, per TechXplore.

""At a megawatt scale, this leads to energy saving, significant reductions in cost, and a smaller material footprint, which makes the charging stations environmentally friendly.""

The new converter design also allows for a compact charging hub that can both store electricity and send it back to the grid when needed, TechXplore reported. This ""two-way"" power flow means stations could keep cars running and also act as backup power sources during emergencies.

""We made the solution much smaller and more compact compared to existing solutions,"" said Harisyam PV, first author of the study, per TechXplore.

The innovation in India means stations could charge multiple vehicles at once, hook up directly to renewable sources such as solar, and even provide emergency power to places like hospitals during outages.

The breakthrough will make charging electric cars faster and cheaper for drivers while also enabling stations to operate more efficiently when multiple cars require power simultaneously. Because it wastes less energy, it can also lower pollution and reduce the need for heavy materials.

It comes at a time when other advancements in charging technology are taking shape, including solar-powered EV chargers, wireless charging, and increased battery storage capacity.

The researchers in India tested a prototype that delivered power at more than 95% efficiency, and they now plan to scale up to systems that can charge buses and cars together, per TechXplore.

Beyond EV charging, the converter could be applied to data centers, wind power, and railway systems.

Both developments are expected to come online before 2030, aligning with Australia’s national renewable energy goals.

Large-Scale Solar and Storage Projects

The Punchs Creek project, located near Toowoomba in southern Queensland, will feature a 400 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) facility co-located with a 400 MW / 1,600 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). Meanwhile, the Merino project, to be built near Goulburn in southern New South Wales, will integrate a 450 MW solar installation with a 450 MW / 1,800 MWh battery system.

According to EDPR, the Punchs Creek project is slated to reach financial close in 2026, with commissioning expected in early 2029. The Merino project is targeted to achieve ready-to-build status in the second half of 2026.

Support Under the Capacity Investment Scheme

Both projects were among 20 renewable developments selected under the Australian federal government’s latest Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) tender. The CIS provides a revenue underwriting mechanism that cushions developers against market price volatility - offering support if revenues dip below an agreed floor and requiring revenue sharing if earnings exceed a set cap.

EDPR Australia Country Director Simon Franklin insisted that the scheme provides “vital support” for accelerating new renewable capacity in the National Electricity Market.

Economic and Community Impact

Once operational, the Punchs Creek and Merino projects will collectively host around 1.5 million solar panels spanning 1,600 hectares. Together, they are expected to generate about 2.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) of clean electricity annually - enough to power roughly 380,000 Australian homes during peak demand periods.

Construction of the two hybrid projects is projected to create more than 1,600 local jobs, stimulating regional economies and supporting local businesses and service providers.

Expanding EDPR’s Australian Portfolio

The Punchs Creek and Merino developments form part of EDPR Australia’s growing 4 GW pipeline, which includes over 30 town-scale and large-scale solar and battery projects nationwide. The company described Australia as a key market with strong fundamentals for renewables and emphasised its strategic focus on hybrid projects combining solar, wind, and energy storage technologies.

The study announces a clear warning: humanity has entered a “new reality”, crossing the first of many Earth system tipping points, with coral reefs now irreversibly destabilised.

The report was published ahead of COP30, the annual United Nations climate talks, slated to take place in Brazil this year. The event is expected to provide a platform for global lawmakers, climate activists and leaders, congregating to shape a plan and agenda to tackle the planetary crisis.

INDIA'S PATH

India, ranked among the world’s top climate-vulnerable nations, must closely watch these developments. Multiple reports have emphasised that building climate resilience is now more cost-effective than reactive rebuilding after disasters.

The world's most populous country has also been flagged for approaching a groundwater depletion tipping point, particularly in regions where overexploited aquifers threaten agricultural livelihoods and food security.

As COP30 looms, the new report adds urgency to the demand for bold policy shifts, deep emissions cuts, and institutional innovation – without which the world risks facing a high scale of damage, which will only worsen with time.

“Only with decisive policy and civil society action,” said Lenton, “can we tip the trajectory toward a safer, sustainable future.”

CORAL REEFS TAKE THE HIT

The Second Global Tipping Points Report finds that warm-water coral reefs, providing a home to nearly a billion people and on which a quarter of marine life depend, are now passing their thermal tipping threshold.

Widespread damage is evident, and unless global warming is reversed, extensive reef systems may vanish, with only small refuges surviving, that too, under intensive protection.

“Warm-water coral reefs are passing their tipping point,” said Dr Mike Barrett, a co-author of the report. “ This grim situation must be a wake-up call that unless we act decisively now, we will also lose the Amazon rainforest, the ice sheets and vital ocean currents. In that scenario we would be looking at a truly catastrophic outcome for all humanity.”

The tipping point for corals is around 1.2 °C of warming – a plausible range is from 1.0 to 1.5 °C. With global warming already around 1.3 to 1.4 °C, the report argues that reefs are effectively doomed unless temperatures fall substantially.

LOOMING THREATS: ICE, FORESTS, CURRENTS

advertisement

Beyond corals, the study cautions that the world is close to other irreversible thresholds too – melting polar ice sheets, the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and the natural death of the Amazon rainforest.

On the Amazon rainforest, the report placed the threshold for widespread forest loss at 1.5 °C. It highlighted the urgency of the situation for the location housing a slew of flora and fauna and where COP30 is to take place in November.

Meanwhile, the AMOC, a vital ocean current system, is predicted to collapse under warming beyond 2 °C. If the particular threshold is crosses, the consequences would include disrupted monsoons, summer rainfall patterns, and global food insecurity.

SILVER LINING

Amidst dire warnings, the report highlights pathways to self-reinforcing transitions towards sustainability.

Already, tipping has occurred in sectors such as solar and wind power, electric vehicles, battery storage, and heat pumps. Coordinated policy action at “super-leverage points” could trigger cascading transitions across energy, transport, heating, and beyond.

“We’ve seen a radical acceleration in solar uptake and electric vehicles,” said Lenton. “But we must move faster and seize positive tipping opportunities, — if we are to steer away from chaos and toward a thriving, sustainable future.”

Brazil’s COP30 Presidency is collaborating directly with the report authors to place tipping points at the heart of the summit’s agenda. Ambassador Andre Correa do Lago, President-designate of COP30, said: ""The Global Tipping Points Report stands as hopeful and sober evidence that humanity can still choose to change and evolve towards a safe, prosperous and equitable future.""

HIGH STAKES

With the world's trajectory on course to breach the 1.5 °C limit, the authors argue that preventing overshoot — or at least minimising it — is crucial. Every decimal of warming and each year spent above 1.5 °C increases the chance of triggering catastrophic events.

The report also emphasises that abrupt, irreversible tipping points demand new governance models—current policy frameworks and decision-making processes are inadequate.

“Current policy thinking doesn’t usually take tipping points into account,"" said Dr Manjana Milkoreit of the University of Oslo and another co-author. ""Preventing tipping points requires ‘front-loaded’ mitigation pathways that minimise peak global temperature. Sustainable carbon dioxide removal approaches need to be rapidly scaled up to achieve this.""

By building strong cross-sector partnerships, we can accelerate the adoption of technology-driven solutions to address Hong Kong's most pressing sustainability challenges, while ensuring that progress is inclusive and enduring.""

Catalyzing transformation through collaborative innovation

At the summit, Schneider Electric showcased its latest innovations in digitalization, electrification and automation, aimed at helping industries navigate today's complex energy landscape:

- Buildings

As Hong Kong charts its path towards carbon neutrality, the building sector presents both challenges and opportunities. At the summit, Schneider Electric highlighted how technology and strategic partnerships are transforming the way buildings are managed, retrofitted and optimized to support a low-carbon future.

Through a recently signed Memorandum of Understanding with The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Schneider Electric reinforces its commitment – alongside the French innovation community in Hong Kong – to advancing retrofitting as a key strategy for decarbonizing the building sector. The partnership will explore energy-saving opportunities across campus buildings, and promote technical exchange to support improvements in the city's existing infrastructure.

In partnership with a leading property developer in Hong Kong, Schneider Electric is piloting a DC microgrid energy storage system to help reduce energy loss during AC-DC conversion and improve renewable energy capture, laying the groundwork for a future-ready energy infrastructure in commercial and mixed-used developments.

Schneider Electric's latest building solutions are designed to deliver measurable improvements in efficiency and resilience. EcoStruxure Building Data Platform offers centralized access to building data, streamlining integration, management and decision-making. Meanwhile, SpaceLogicTM AI BOX uses digital twin technology and AI to simulate and optimize HVAC performance across operations and maintenance.

- Data Centers

The rapid growth of AI is reshaping the digital landscape, driving increased demand for high-density computing and energy-efficient data center infrastructure. To meet these evolving needs, Schneider Electric is advancing innovative technologies – including liquid cooling and advanced power protection — to support more efficient, reliable and scalable operations.

In collaboration with Equinix, Schneider Electric deployed its newest in-rack, direct-to-chip liquid cooling CDU system at the HK1 data center. Designed for ultra-efficient thermal management and energy optimization without major retrofits, the solution enables operators to address the demands of AI-driven workloads with greater reliability and safety.

Schneider Electric continues to advance its leadership in data center infrastructure, software and services to meet the demands of the AI era. Following its acquisition of Motivair Corporation, the company has strengthened its end-to-end liquid cooling portfolio for hyperscale, colocation and high-density environments. This strategic move reinforces Schneider Electric's position as a leading provider of power and cooling infrastructure. Additionally, the new Galaxy VXL UPS sets a benchmark in ultra-compact, energy-efficient and AI-load tolerant design, offering next-generation power protection for critical infrastructure environments.

- Power & Grids

In collaboration with a utility company in Hong Kong, Schneider Electric is advancing smarter grids through integrated solutions such as EcoStruxure Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) and EcoStruxure Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS), aimed at providing smart and flexible network optimization, and futureproofing infrastructure to support Hong Kong’s evolving energy needs.

- EV Charging

Hong Kong is making steady progress in the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), supported by strong commitments from both public and private sectors. Ensuring charging infrastructure that is reliable and efficient will be key to supporting long-term growth and meeting future mobility needs.

,EPA,2025-10-13 06:00:22+00:00,Western Australian Government,Program: Index of Surveys for Assessments | Western Australian Government,Not Available,,,,,https://www.wa.gov.au/service/environment/environmental-impact-assessment/program-index-of-surveys-assessments,"Does my post-assessment, ongoing monitoring or compliance process require an ISA data package to be submitted?
ISA data packages are only required for field surveys that have generated new data.
Studies based entirely on previously existing observations, for example desktop studies or consolidated reports, do not require ISA data packages.
The intellectual property owner decides at submission whether the ISA data package submitted will be made public and granted for third-party use.
ISA data packages should be submitted in accordance with the Procedure: Preparing data packages for the Index of Surveys for Assessment (ISA), which can be viewed on the Environment Online ISA guidance page.","Am I required to submit data to ISA?

If you are submitting a biodiversity or marine survey report to DWER, the EPA or DMPE to support an assessment, post-assessment or compliance process under the EP Act, it will need to be accompanied by an ISA data package that has been prepared according to the Procedure: Preparing data packages for the Index of Surveys for Assessment (ISA). The procedure can be viewed on the Environment Online ISA guidance page.

What type of survey data is captured by ISA?

ISA captures all biodiversity and marine survey data generated to support assessment processes or meet post-assessment requirements under the EP Act for the EPA’s Sea, Water and Land factors.

Does my post-assessment, ongoing monitoring or compliance process require an ISA data package to be submitted?

If there is a requirement for a biodiversity or marine survey report to be submitted to DWER, the EPA or DMPE for assessment, post-assessment or compliance purposes, it must be accompanied by an ISA data package.

If a biodiversity survey report was supplied to support approvals under the EP Act to demonstrate compliance with conditions of approval, such as Compliance Assessment Reports and Annual Environmental Reports, it needs to be accompanied by an ISA data package.

If conditions of approval require a post-assessment biodiversity survey or ongoing biodiversity monitoring, and submission of the resulting biodiversity survey reports to DWER, the EPA or DMPE, then ISA data packages must accompany these biodiversity survey reports. In cases where submission of such reports is not a requirement of approval conditions, the submission of ISA data packages is encouraged but is not mandatory.

Should I submit data associated with desktop studies to ISA?

No. ISA data packages are only required for field surveys that have generated new data. Studies based entirely on previously existing observations, for example desktop studies or consolidated reports, do not require ISA data packages.

If a study is based on a mix of existing and new data, for example a basic survey that comprises a desktop study and a site visit, an ISA data package should be supplied. This package should include the biodiversity survey report and the data obtained during the site visit, but not the existing data from the desktop component.

However, for marine surveys, data that is used to support models or other projections that are referenced can be provided.

I have a biodiversity survey report, but it is not related to an EP Act assessment or compliance process. Can I submit this to ISA?

It is outside of ISA’s scope to publish reports and datasets from surveys that were not conducted to support DWER, EPA and DMPE assessment and compliance processes under the EP Act. If you have a significant quantity of such information, please contact ibsa@dwer.wa.gov.au to discuss what options may exist.

Is all biodiversity and marine survey information provided for assessment automatically made public in ISA (IBSA/IMSA portals)?

The intellectual property owner decides at submission whether the ISA data package submitted will be made public and granted for third-party use. However, this information may still be made public for the purposes of an assessment or public consultation via DWER, DMPE or EPA websites under the EP Act. For more information, refer to the ISA Procedure and Data Licence Statement and Environment Online Terms of Use.

Records of species and communities contained in ISA data packages may also be shared with the Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, but public availability is subject to Dandjoo’s terms and conditions.

At what point during the ISA process are data packages made publicly available in the IBSA or IMSA portal? Can I amend a data package once it has been submitted?

Once the relevant agency has made and published its final decision or recommendation on the assessment, review or compliance process, ISA will make the relevant data packages publicly available, depending on the Data Licence Statement granted on submission. Until then, the data packages remain in an internal data environment for the purposes of an assessment or application. During the assessment or compliance process, the submitter can provide corrected or updated data packages if requested or there is a need to do so via the Environment Online portal.

Can I change my mind about making my data publicly available, or change the type of licence that I have granted, once my data has been uploaded to the IBSA or IMSA portal?

No. For technical reasons, the department is unable to amend metadata and licensing statements or process requests to change the public availability of data packages once they have been finalised and uploaded to the IBSA or IMSA portal.

No. ISA is not a relational database. If species names or other attributes change during an assessment or compliance process, the ISA data should be updated via the EO Portal or if a revised biodiversity survey report is submitted, a similarly revised ISA data package should also be submitted. Species names and status of ISA Records may be updated in the Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) Dandjoo Portal, where available.

How do I submit my reports and data to IBSA?

Clients do not upload data directly to ISA. ISA data packages must be submitted via Environment Online. ISA data packages should be submitted in accordance with the Procedure: Preparing data packages for the Index of Surveys for Assessment (ISA), which can be viewed on the Environment Online ISA guidance page.

If I am submitting an ISA data package, do I still have to submit data, such as significant species observations, to the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA)?

Yes. Currently, ISA data packages do not automatically feed into DBCA processes. Any requirements for the supply of survey reports and data to DBCA, for example where the conditions of a collecting licence require DBCA to be informed of significant species observations, still apply and must be adhered to regardless of whether or not an ISA data package has been submitted.

Am I permitted to submit information on threatened, priority and other significant species to ISA?

Yes. The goal of ISA is to publicly share biodiversity and marine survey data collected to support environmental assessments, which may include significant species location information. However, records of locations of significant species may be withheld from being made publicly available on advice from DBCA.

ISA data packages should include all species records, including those for significant species and introduced species.

Is ISA part of the Shared Location Information Platform (SLIP) or data.wa.gov.au?

No. SLIP and data.wa.gov.au contain curated, general-purpose datasets. Reports and datasets in ISA are not curated or consolidated. Individual ISA data packages can be accessed via the IBSA portal and IMSA portal, depending on the publication and third-party data use licence granted on submission.

Will all government agencies have unrestricted access to the data packages I supply for ISA?

Data submitted via ISA is done so in accordance with the State of Western Australian Government’s Open Data Policy.

However, currently non-public ISA data packages will only be available to the State Government of Western Australia agencies listed in the ISA Data Licence Agreement for the purposes of their respective Acts and Regulations. Requests for access to ISA data packages from other State Government agencies will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the purposes of the request, their acts, and the ISA Data Licence Statement issued.

Data packages that have been licensed to be made publicly available or for third-party use including all survey metadata, will be accessible to anybody – including government agencies. Therefore, government agencies will have the same level of access to information, the same options for acquiring datasets based on metadata and licencing granted, and the same conditions for using information that other ISA users have.

How do I access ISA data packages (e.g. biodiversity and marine survey reports and associated data)?

Go to the IBSA or IMSA portals. Browse the surveys or use the filters on the left, including the geographic filter, to find the surveys you are looking for. Note that the individual surveys displayed in the map, list and tile views, to the right of the filter panel, will be constrained by the number you have set to display per page (20, 50, 100 or 500).

Click on a survey title to go to the page for that survey. There you can view basic details of the survey under the ‘About’ tab, and see the metadata and licensing summary and any available reports and data files under the ‘Resources’ tab. Survey reports and data files will only be present if the intellectual property owner has licensed them for publication via the metadata and licensing statement.

How do I log in to the IBSA or IMSA portals? Are there fees for using it?

You do not need to log in to the IBSA or IMSA portals. Although there is a ‘Login’ button in the bottom banner, this is only for site administrators. IBSA and IMSA users can access all functionality without requiring an account or paying any access fees.

How do I search and filter the data packages?

The search box at the top right of the ‘Surveys’ page offers limited keyword searching. It searches only within metadata, i.e. titles, authors and the information under ‘Survey details’ and ‘Citation’ under the ‘About’ tab. Full text searching within reports and datasets is not supported. The search box is most useful when searching for a specific data package; refer to the question ‘How do I search by ‘IBSA/IMSA number’ for a specific data package?’, below.

The filter pane on the left-hand side of the ‘Surveys’ page offers limited filtering of results by ‘Receiving agency’, ‘Assessment type’ and ‘Author’. Only one filter may be applied per category. Click on ‘Refine’ to apply your selected options. Once a filter has been applied, the search box may also be used to conduct a keyword search within the filter results.

The ‘Geographic filter’ option is the most powerful and intuitive way of browsing IBSA data packages. Click ‘Filter by geographic region’ in the filter pane, apply a filter area using the popup box and click ‘Next’. In the popup box you can:

orient yourself by making the map full screen, toggling different base layers and overlays, searching for a specific location and zooming in and out

apply a custom filter area by drawing a square, circle or freeform polygon

apply a predefined filter area using the ‘Select a known shape’ button – options include bioregions and subregions, local government areas, Ramsar wetland regions and NRM regions.

How do I search by IBSA or IMSA number for a specific data package?

Each ISA data package is assigned a unique IBSA, IMSA or ISA number in the format ‘IBSA-YYYY-NNNN’. If you know the number for a data package you want to find, enter this number within double quotation marks in the search box at the top right of the ‘Surveys’ page. For example, if you wanted to find IBSA-2019-1234 you would enter “IBSA-2019-1234”. This data package will then be the first entry on the page of search results (this will not be apparent in map view – switch to tile or list view if necessary).

If you cannot find the data package you are looking for, remember that it might not yet have been published online; refer to the question ‘At what point during the ISA process are data packages made publicly available?’ in the 'FAQs – ISA requirements' section, above.

How should I navigate search and filter results?

If you perform a keyword search or apply a text filter, display your search results in tile or list view and navigate to an individual survey page, you will see a ‘Back to search results’ button on that survey page. Use this to return to the results of your search or filter.

If you perform a keyword search or apply a text filter, display your search results in map view and navigate to an individual survey page, you will not see a ‘Back to search results’ button on that survey page. Instead, use your browser’s ‘back’ button to return to the results of your search or filter.

If you apply a geographic filter and navigate to an individual survey page, do not use the ‘Back to search results’ button or your browser’s ‘back’ button. If you do, your filter results will be lost. Instead, open individual survey pages in new browser tabs, preserving your filter results in the original tab.

From any page, select ‘Surveys’ in the top banner to cancel all keyword searches and filters and return to the complete list of data packages.

How do I know whether I have permission to use reports and data I have found in the IBSA or IMSA portals?

Review Sections 3 and 4 of the metadata and licensing summary, under the ‘Resources’ tab for the relevant survey, by downloading it or using the online document preview feature. These sections show what type of licensing has been allowed by the intellectual property owner; users of IBSA or IMSA must adhere to the terms of these licences, as well as the general terms detailed in the IBSA or IMSA disclaimer. If you download survey reports or data files from IBSA or IMSA, you should also download the relevant metadata and licensing summary and retain it alongside the downloaded information.

Is the ‘Survey Area’, shown under the ‘About’ tab for a survey, exact?

No. This Survey Area boundary is approximate and is simply intended to facilitate geographic searching in the IBSA and IMSA portals and give a general overview of the area covered by a biodiversity survey report. If it is important that you know the exact boundaries of a survey, you should examine the survey details spatial dataset provided under the ‘Resources’ tab (if available).

I can't see the ‘Survey Area’ under the ‘About’ tab. What should I do?

The map viewer built into the 'About' tab for surveys on the IBSA and IMSA portals can sometimes behave unexpectedly. There is a known issue with the default display of the Survey Area map, particularly when the page length is less than the screen height. It will correct itself when you scroll down, but short pages may not be able to scroll down and therefore can’t auto-correct. If the map viewer is not showing survey boundaries correctly, please try:

updating your browser (note that the IBSA and IMSA portals are optimised for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome – they will also work on other browsers, but we recommend Firefox or Chrome)

removing or disabling browser extensions such as ad blockers

resetting the size of the browser window (e.g. by maximising then restoring it)

toggling different base layers in the map viewer (e.g. switch from the 'Road Map' base layer to the 'Satellite' base layer).",https://www.wa.gov.au/themes/custom/wagov/images/gov-wa-logo.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:37.160089

Investors are weighing rapid growth prospects against concerns about rising valuations.

Bloom Energy’s latest buzz is part of a much wider rally. Over the past year, the company has delivered a staggering 708.85% total shareholder return, fueled by its AI-driven clean energy solutions and fresh high-profile partnerships. Even after a 29.16% one-month share price gain and recent announcements about doubling manufacturing capacity, momentum is still building as investors weigh technology leadership against already lofty valuations.

If you’re watching this surge and wondering what other innovation-led stocks might be setting the pace, broaden your search and discover

So after such a dramatic run, is Bloom Energy’s rapid growth story fully reflected in today’s share price? Alternatively, could the next earnings report reveal a fresh buying opportunity for investors before markets price in even more future gains?

Most Popular Narrative: 50.7% Overvalued

Bloom Energy's widely followed narrative assigns a fair value well below the last close price, highlighting high growth assumptions that need to materialize to support today’s valuation.

Widespread grid constraints and long interconnection timelines for traditional utility-scale power create a time-to-power advantage for Bloom's solutions. This boosts its competitive edge in mission-critical markets and is expected to expand the company's addressable market, positively impacting future top-line growth.

Curious how much future revenue has to surge for this high valuation to stick? The boldest financial projections drive the case, but few know all the details. Want to see exactly which growth assumptions are fueling this figure? You might be surprised by just how aggressive the narrative gets on margins and earnings over the next three years.

Result: Fair Value of $57.63 (OVERVALUED)

However, rapid advances in zero-emissions technologies or setbacks in Bloom's cost control could quickly challenge even the most bullish growth assumptions.

Another View: What Does Our DCF Model Say?

Looking at our DCF model, Bloom Energy’s shares appear to be trading slightly below fair value, with the current price at $86.87 compared to our estimate of $90.67. While this suggests modest upside, the margin is tight and raises questions about how much safety investors really have at this level. What could tip the balance next?

As the global population surges and energy demand rises, protecting nature is not just an environmental imperative, but a social and economic one too. That’s because more than half of global GDP – approximately $58 trillion – is directly or indirectly dependent on nature.

With the world’s population projected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, the path forward is not less energy or slower development but a smarter, pragmatic approach. This is because expanding access to affordable, reliable energy remains essential to human progress. This, however, must be squared with the world’s collective responsible for safeguarding nature and biodiversity.

At Adnoc, we assess and manage nature-related risks and opportunities alongside financial and climate considerations in keeping with the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. We embed nature into strategic planning and investment decisions and this thinking is at the heart of Adnoc’s Hail and Ghasha, the world’s largest gas development of its kind that aims to operate with net-zero emissions.

Located within Abu Dhabi’s Unesco-designated Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve, this energy project is expected to produce more than 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day of gas before the end of the decade, enough gas to cover the daily needs of Ireland, Greece and Portugal combined. It will also capture 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually for safe underground storage, produce low-carbon hydrogen to replace fuel gas and draw power from the UAE’s clean energy grid, fed by nuclear and solar.

Hail and Ghasha will not only operate responsibly, producing more energy with fewer emissions, it will also do so while ensuring sustainable use of the natural area.

That’s because the Marawah Reserve hosts extraordinarily diverse marine and coastal ecosystems. It’s rich in seagrass meadows that sustain the world’s second-largest population of dugongs, and is home to coral reefs, mangroves, ospreys, turtles and countless fish species.

To protect this biodiversity, Adnoc, together with the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi, conducted one of the largest marine environmental baseline surveys in the UAE’s history. By mapping habitats in unprecedented detail, we were able to carefully optimise well locations and trajectories, ensuring construction and drilling activities avoid sensitive areas.

The findings were integrated into a biodiversity monitoring programme which now guides every stage of Hail and Ghasha’s development. It informed initiatives such as building hundreds of nesting platforms for ospreys, deploying artificial coral reef structures and fish domes for marine biodiversity, and creating a rescue and rehabilitation programme for sea turtles, supported by education and research partnerships.

Efforts also extend to large-scale habitat restoration as we are committed to planting one million mangroves during the project’s lifecycle, under our broader pledge to plant 10 million mangroves by 2030.

When I think about Hail and Ghasha in the context of today’s competing priorities to simultaneously meet rising energy demand without neglecting our collective desire to create a world our children would be proud of, three lessons stand out.

The first is that large-scale industrial projects can be responsible by design. With foresight and investment, they can channel new resources, investment and expertise into critical developments that help to build environmental resilience.

Second is that we should see development capital as conservation capital. By embedding biodiversity and emissions-reduction measures into flagship energy projects, we can scale investment in conservation.

And finally, energy security and environmental stewardship can be mutually reinforcing – they do not need to be mutually exclusive. As the UAE’s population rises (one only needs to read The National to note that Abu Dhabi’s population soared to 4.1 million people last year) energy demand will rise too.

By aligning that goal with decarbonisation and the continued transformation of energy systems, industries can demonstrate how sustainable development does indeed create a clear and pragmatic pathway to multiply conservation impact.

Ever since the UAE’s first oil discovery in 1958, energy has been not only a commodity, but a driver for social and economic progress.

LGES warned in July of a further slowdown in EV demand by early next year due to the elimination of the tax credits as well as US import tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration.

LGES shares were up 1.5 per cent in a wider market that was down 1.4 per cent.

The company would have made a 236 billion won operating profit excluding US battery manufacturing incentives it received under the US Inflation Reduction Act, the company said in a regulatory filing.

LGES will release detailed earnings on Oct 30.

Energy storage, Georgia raid

LGES has tried to boost production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset sluggish EV demand and improve profits in the second half of this year.

The company has signed a US$4.3 billion deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, as the US automaker looks to reduce reliance on Chinese imports due to tariffs.

In September, LGES suffered a setback with its joint battery factory with Hyundai Motor in the United States. Construction has been suspended in the wake of an immigration raid on the Georgia facility in early September that led to the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers.

Hyundai Motor CEO Jose Munoz said last month that the factory was facing a minimum startup delay of two to three months after the raid.

LGES said early this month that it would gradually resume US business trips for its employees and subcontractors, a day after the Trump administration agreed to allow South Koreans to work on equipment at US sites under existing temporary visas.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Global warming is crossing dangerous thresholds sooner than expected with the world’s coral reefs now in an almost irreversible die-off, marking what scientists on Monday described as the first “tipping point” in climate-driven ecosystem collapse.

The warning in the Global Tipping Points report by 160 researchers worldwide, which synthesizes groundbreaking science to estimate points of no return, comes just weeks ahead of this year's COP30 climate summit being held at the edge of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.

That same rainforest system is now at risk of collapsing once the average global temperature warms beyond just 1.5 degrees Celsius based on deforestation rates, the report said, revising down the estimated threshold for the Amazon.

Also of concern if temperatures keep rising is the threat of disruption to the major ocean current called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, which helps to ensure mild winters in northern Europe.

“Change is happening fast now, tragically, in parts of the climate, the biosphere,” said environmental scientist Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, who is the lead author of the report.

SOME POSITIVE SIGNS

Lenton noted positive signs when it came to phasing out the fossil fuels most responsible for climate change. Renewables, for example, accounted for more electricity generation than coal this year for the first time, according to data from the nonprofit think tank Ember.

“Nobody wants to be just traumatized and disempowered,” Lenton said. “We still have some agency.”

The scientists implored countries at November's COP30 to work toward bringing down climate-warming carbon emissions.

Scientists have been surprised by how quickly changes are unfolding in nature, with average global temperatures already having warmed by 1.3-1.4 degrees Celsius (2.3 to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above the preindustrial average, according to data from U.N. and EU science agencies.

WARMEST ON RECORD

The last two years were Earth’s warmest on record, with marine heatwaves that stressed 84% of the world’s reefs to the point of bleaching and, in some cases, death. Coral reefs sustain about a quarter of marine life.

For corals to recover, the world would need to drastically ramp up climate action to reverse temperatures back down to just 1 degree C above the preindustrial average, the scientists suggested.

“The new report makes clear that each year there is an increase in the scope and magnitude of the negative impacts of climate change,” said Pep Canadell, a senior scientist at Australia’s CSIRO Climate Science Centre.

The world is currently on track for about 3.1 degrees C of warming in this century, based on national policies.

EMNRD News:

State grants will go to public entities, including cities, school districts & tribes

SANTA FE – The New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) is now accepting grant applications from public entities that can demonstrate how new technologies can be harnessed to develop a reliable, modern electric grid.

The grant funding comes from the Community Benefits Fund the State Legislature created during its 2025 legislative session. The legislature allocated $70 million from the Community Benefit Fund to the Grid Modernization Program administered by EMNRD Energy Conservation and Management Division (ECAM).

“This Grid Modernization Grant Fund infusion is a game-changer for New Mexico’s ability to find innovative ways of strengthening our electric grid and building long-term resilience for our communities,” ECAM Director Rebecca “Puck” Stair said. “At the exact time the federal government is cancelling grants for projects designed to improve energy infrastructure, New Mexico is leaning in with record state funding for grid mod.”

Grid modernization projects are expected to upgrade electric distribution or transmission infrastructure to accommodate integration of renewable electricity sources or otherwise make the grid more efficient, reliable and secure and better able to respond to expected growth in energy demand.

ECAM is seeking to award grant funds to three types of projects:

Projects that involve construction, installation, operation and verification of functioning modern grid technology at a project site.

Projects consisting of pre-construction or design activities that would eventually result in the building and installation of fully functional modern grid technology.

Original research projects that advance the state’s understanding and appreciation of grid function, reliability, resilience, security and operation relating to the integration of renewable and zero-carbon resources, including impacts on customer behavior, operations and maintenance costs or the value of specific grid technologies.

By law, eligible applicants include municipalities and county governments; state agencies; public schools; state universities and other post-secondary education institutions; and Native American nations, tribes, and pueblos. All projects must take place within New Mexico.

The trends suggested by the report, published last week, may not be conclusive enough to rule out the influential hypothesis that the increasing deployment of clean energy will not necessarily lead to a decline in fossil fuel use over the long-term. Yet, the marginal difference — barely 1 per cent — between polluting and non-polluting sources of power is encouraging because renewables have made inroads amid a growing appetite for electricity in a world roiled by geopolitical crises that have deeply impacted the energy market. The report highlights that record solar-power generation and a steady expansion of wind energy helped renewables keep pace with the increasing demand for electricity to power traditional industrial units, keep buildings cool in the face of rising temperatures, drive electric vehicles, and operate new sources of economic activity, such as data centres.

The fine print of the Ember report, however, reveals both positives and negatives. Much of the growth in clean energy has come in China, where a growing fleet of solar-powered stations has outpaced coal energy plants. In India too, the clean-energy graph is headed northward, and the country is on course to become the second-largest renewables market by 2030. In several developing countries in Asia and Africa, policies that encourage the development of green-technology solar power have driven a climate-friendly energy transition. The outlook, however, is not that rosy in most parts of the developed world. In Europe, poor wind conditions and drought precipitated a more than 14 per cent rise in fossil-fuel electricity generation, reminding policymakers that much needs to be done to mitigate the precarity of renewable energy. In the US, clean-energy policies have hit a roadblock, largely because of President Donald Trump’s climate denialism and his strident advocacy of fossil fuels. In July, the Congress voted to phase out the tax credit support for wind and solar power. The International Energy Agency has lowered America’s renewable capacity growth expectations by 50 per cent compared to last year. The agency reckons that the attainment of its global target for 2030 will largely depend on how developed countries overcome the recent barriers to climate adaptation.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/10/express-view-Copy-2-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 02:59:02.587604

A working group of Oklahoma researchers and utilities has been assembled to gather information ahead of the study. The OCC partnered with the Hamm Institute for American Energy and identified nuclear energy experts from the University of Oklahoma.

The participants are working as volunteers, said Mark Argenbright, director of the OCC's public utility division. He said Enercon Services, which completed Michigan's nuclear feasibility study, is among the potential companies eyed for the task.

The request comes as the agency reports funding challenges and staffing shortages.

"" We're unable to fill them because we cannot pay the salaries commensurate to draw people to these jobs,"" Commissioner Todd Hiett said. ""And so, we're already cutting and operating very thinly already, and maybe to the legislature, a couple hundred thousand dollars doesn't sound like much, but in our world, that's quite a bit.""

The agency could continue its information gathering without hiring a firm, though Argenbright said the product wouldn't be as comprehensive.

"" We'll create a report regardless of how we deal with the consultant issue,"" he said. ""But it will be at a different level than it would be with a consultant, where we would have a much deeper dive and a broader range of information that would be able to bring to bear on the report.""

The agency could also use money pulled from its assessment fees of utility companies. Chairman Kim David said that the option would result in higher costs for Oklahoma utility customers.

"" I'd like to make a motion that we requested supplemental appropriation for the $125,000 for the report and put it back in their lap,"" David said of the state legislature. ""We have a lot of different people that have given a lot of time and effort and energy into this.""

In response to Hiett voicing support for completing a study that the state can one day use, Commissioner Brian Bingman said the OCC should continue its report without hiring a third-party firm.

"" I kind of disagree because I just don't think the legislature is serious about this,"" he said.

More than a financial incentive Victoria’s new commercial solar rebates are more than a financial incentive.
Commercial solar just graduated from “nice idea” to “strategic necessity” – and Victoria has made the decision easier than ever.","For years, solar rebates have focused heavily on households. Meanwhile, large energy-using businesses were left sitting on prime rooftop real estate with little support to tap into it. That gap has finally been addressed. Victoria has introduced a new commercial solar rebate program designed specifically for big energy users, opening the door for factories, warehouses, supermarkets, and other commercial operations to slash bills and boost sustainability.

This isn’t just another small incentive. It’s a game-changing shift that could transform how businesses manage energy, improve profitability, and accelerate the state’s clean energy goals.

Why businesses should care

Electricity is one of the biggest overheads for commercial and industrial operators. These sites chew through almost a third of Victoria’s total energy use. Until now, there were limited funding options for solar at this scale. Residential rebates capped out too low, and large-scale funding didn’t apply.

This rebate targets the “missing middle” – systems between 30 kW and 200 kW. In other words, the exact size range used by commercial sites with high daytime energy demand. By focusing on where the energy is actually being used, Victoria is unlocking massive savings potential for businesses.

Up to $34,300 off installation? Yes, please

Eligible businesses can receive rebates of up to $34,300 on a commercial solar system. That’s a serious chunk off the upfront cost, reducing financial barriers and significantly cutting payback time.

Here’s why that matters: a 200 kW system can produce around 600 kWh per day. That level of generation can deliver between $64,000 and $68,000 in annual electricity bill savings. With a rebate on top, the return on investment becomes incredibly attractive.

Solar officially stops being “a nice idea” and starts being “a no-brainer business strategy”.

Who can take advantage?

There are tens of thousands of businesses across Victoria with the rooftop space to install 30 kW to 200 kW systems. The scheme is designed for energy-intensive operations such as:

Manufacturing

Warehousing and logistics

Food and beverage processing

Retail hubs and supermarkets

Large commercial offices

If you operate during daylight hours and pay high bills, this incentive has your name on it.

Better yet, businesses installing solar within the eligible size range will also be able to claim Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs), further lowering costs. And if they want to go a step further, battery rebates may also apply through a separate federal program, creating the option of full energy independence.

From cost centre to profit centre

Solar isn’t just about sustainability anymore – it’s a competitive advantage. Lowering energy costs improves margins, increases pricing flexibility, and frees up capital for growth.

With this rebate in play, solar becomes a strategic business move. It helps organisations future-proof against rising energy prices, build resilience, and increase asset value. It even sends a positive signal to customers, investors, and suppliers who increasingly expect sustainability leadership.

And then there’s supply chain pressure. Larger corporations are now demanding lower emissions from their suppliers. This rebate makes it far easier for smaller operators to stay in the game by decarbonising affordably.

Real-world results already happening

This isn’t just theoretical. Commercial solar is already proving its value. One example highlighted in the announcement is a 99 kW system installed on a winery, saving around $22,000 every year. That’s a near-instant increase in profit without selling a single extra bottle.

Now imagine that kind of benefit scaled across thousands of sites. We’re talking tens of millions in savings across the Victorian economy – every single year.

Quality and safety baked in

To ensure installations meet the highest standards, businesses must use Clean Energy Council-approved solar modules. With nearly 3,000 approved products available, there’s no shortage of options. This requirement protects system performance, supports system longevity, and reduces maintenance headaches.

It also protects reputations. No business wants its sustainability story ruined by poor-quality hardware.

The bigger picture: decarbonisation through business leadership

While households have carried much of the solar adoption load, commercial and industrial buildings have far greater potential. They have bigger roof space, bigger energy consumption, and bigger savings.

This rebate signals a clear shift in energy policy: if we want real emissions reductions, we need the commercial sector on board.

By targeting the right size range, Victoria is unlocking emissions reductions at scale without waiting for massive solar farms or complex infrastructure upgrades. It’s smart, practical, and immediately impactful.

Things to consider before diving in

Like any major investment, businesses should plan carefully. Key considerations include:

Network connection approvals

Structural roof assessments

Energy load analysis to maximise self-consumption

Optional battery or demand management strategies

Working with trusted, accredited installers

The right installer will guide businesses through approvals and system design to ensure the best long-term outcome.

Time to move, early adopters will win

Rebates rarely last forever. Early adopters are likely to secure the largest benefits, while latecomers risk missing out or facing longer approval wait times as demand surges.

For businesses with high energy bills, these rebates offer a rare opportunity to turn sunlight into serious savings. Instead of sending money to the grid every month, businesses can invest in their own energy infrastructure and keep those dollars in-house.

More than a financial incentive

Victoria’s new commercial solar rebates are more than a financial incentive. They level the playing field, reward efficiency, and give businesses the tools to take control of their energy future.

Energy independence. Lower bills. Stronger sustainability credentials. Better cash flow.

ENERGY STORAGE, GEORGIA RAID

LGES has tried to boost production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset sluggish EV demand and improve profits in the second half of this year.

The company has signed a $4.3 billion deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, as the U.S. automaker looks to reduce reliance on Chinese imports due to tariffs.

In September, LGES suffered a setback with its joint battery factory with Hyundai Motor in the United States. Construction has been suspended in the wake of an immigration raid on the Georgia facility in early September that led to the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers.

Hyundai Motor CEO Jose Munoz said last month the factory was facing a minimum startup delay of two to three months after the raid.

LGES said early this month that it would gradually resume U.S. business trips for its employees and subcontractors, a day after the Trump administration agreed to allow South Koreans to work on equipment at U.S. sites under existing temporary visas.

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://images.wral.com/asset/business/2025/10/12/22196039/68eb9496641a5-media_b5c41dfb052c4ea5955ceb4e3ecb9e8a-DMID1-68mkdtxsj-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 20:59:27.170776

US authorities have warned they will take retaliatory measures against any country supporting an international carbon tax on maritime transport. This announcement comes just days ahead of a crucial vote within the International Maritime Organization (IMO), where members are set to decide on a proposal to implement a global carbon levy on ship emissions.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, along with the Secretaries of Energy and Transportation, described the proposed measure as “neo-colonial” in a statement. Washington asserts that the implementation of such a fiscal mechanism on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions — referred to by the acronym NZF — would harm US economic interests and negatively impact supply chains and consumers.

Anticipated economic repercussions

US officials estimate the tax could raise shipping costs by 10% or more. Authorities claim that such a levy on carbon emissions would directly affect shipping companies, energy suppliers and importers, leading to price increases for citizens and businesses.

The NZF tax proposal would be the first global fiscal mechanism adopted by a United Nations agency, according to the statement. The London-based IMO oversees international shipping regulations and aims to reduce the sector’s total emissions in line with its environmental goals.

A stance aligned with current US policy

Since returning to power, President Donald Trump has reoriented US energy policy in favour of fossil fuels, rolling back multiple international climate commitments. The White House withdrew from the Paris Agreement and enacted a series of deregulation measures aimed at supporting the oil, gas and coal industries.

This shift has resulted in growing hostility toward multilateral initiatives perceived as burdensome to the US economy. At the United Nations, President Trump previously described climate change as “the greatest scam” in history, rejecting scientific consensus and advocating for complete economic sovereignty.

Targeted economic sanctions under consideration

Among the measures under consideration are visa restrictions and increased port fees for vessels owned by or registered in countries supporting the carbon tax. These steps are intended to discourage any endorsement of a system the US considers imposed without its consent.

Prices have collapsed since the 2022 peak, investor sentiment is bruised, and there are persistent murmurs of an EV slowdown. Yet those closest to the ground – the explorers, developers, and future producers – are saying something very different.

According to global leaders across the sector, the world is sleepwalking into the largest structural supply deficit in the history of battery metals. And this time, the demand drivers go far beyond electric vehicles.

Mining.com.au is this week digging deep into the state of the lithium market and in a feature series that uncovers how mining leaders see the outlook to 2030 and beyond, and what the catalysts will be driving the market.

Speaking exclusively to a range of global lithium leaders, a powerful consensus is emerging – the lithium market is not dying, it’s maturing. And the next decade is poised to dwarf everything that has come before.

The global lithium market is in a period of flux. After years of solid growth, prices have plummeted from the 2022 peak amid reports of declining demand for EVs and an oversupply.

However, ongoing demand growth and temporary production curtailments in China has seen lithium prices improve so far in the September quarter. Spodumene concentrate prices increased from just above US$600 a tonne in June, reached US$1,000 tonne in late August, before easing to around US$820 a tonne in the second half of September.

Although this price recovery may be under threat from the reported reopening of a higher cost lepidolite operation in China on 10 September 2025.

Lithium hydroxide prices have enjoyed a recovery of almost 20% over the same period, rising from US$7,550 a tonne to around US$9,000 ($13,835) in September. The rise follows a recovery in spodumene prices – the primary feedstock for these operations refineries – with refiners starting to draw down on their accumulated inventories.

By 2027, spodumene is expected to rise to an annual average price of about US$925 a tonne, while lithium hydroxide should average about US$13,250.

Australia is the largest producer of lithium ore (accounting for 46% of the global total in 2024) but felt this decline more sharply than most. In turn several mining operations paused amid deteriorating market conditions.

However, analysts and mining executives alike believe a rebound may be on the horizon, fuelled by renewed growth in EV adoption and clean energy storage. Although lithium prices remain difficult to predict, miners are once more betting big on the metal.

‘Dark horse’ of demand

Venari Minerals (ASX:ASE) CEO Matt Healy is blunt – global lithium demand will triple by 2030, yet the current market is acting like the party’s over.

“The price collapse created the illusion that supply is abundant,” he tells Mining.com.au, “but even a minor disruption like recent mine shutdowns in China sent prices bouncing back. That tells you the market is far tighter than people think.”

Healy notes a critical fact that many overlook is that the world needs 50 to 70 new lithium mines by 2030 just to meet demand.

“This represents around double the number of significant mines in operation today,” he says. “That is a near-impossible task at current investment levels.”

EVs will constitute the main source of lithium consumption going forward, notes Healy, with increasing growth in consumption rates arising from stationary storage, electric trucks, and buses.

Further driving this growth, says Healy, is the rapid penetration of renewable energy into Western energy markets, which has resulted in excess electricity necessitating storage technology.

For this reason global Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) deployments in H1 2025 are up 58% over the first six months of 2024, making BESS the “dark horse” of lithium demand, he adds.

According to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) September 2025 Resources and Energy Quarterly, BESS growth is expected to be at almost 13% a year to 2027 driven primarily by its increasingly important role in electricity grids.

BESS are now also supplying electricity during high demand periods in addition to their existing role in providing grid auxiliary services.

Healy’s own focus is advancing Venari’s resource pipeline, with metallurgical work, a maiden resource and a scoping study in the next 18-24 months.

Fear and loathing

Similarly, Q2 Metals (TSX-V:QTWO) Corporate Development Chris Ackerman calls today’s sentiment what it is – irrational.

“Lithium is probably the most loathed commodity right now,” he tells this news service.

“But EV adoption is still growing. BESS is accelerating even faster. Nations are racing to secure supply. The fundamentals are stronger than ever.”

Ackerman says there are other disruptors that are emerging and vying for centre stage, as well. With the advancement of AI and the need for data centres, as well as the need for energy storage capacity for solar and wind (renewables) energy via BESS, will be key drivers moving forward. BESS is needed to store renewable energy/energy grid storage.

He thinks the assertion that there has been declining demand for EVs is something industry watchers might challenge. The International Energy Agency, for instance, cites robust sales.

According to the IEA, global electric car sales in 2025 are expected to exceed 20 million to represent more than 25% of cars sold worldwide. Sales were up 35% year-on-year in the first three months of 2025, with record first-quarter sales in all major markets.

In China, the IEA reports continuation of incentives for replacing older vehicles and falling electric car prices mean electric cars are projected to reach around 60% of total car sales in the country in 2025.

Emissions standards in the European Union and the UK will require higher shares of zero-emission car sales in 2025.

The IEA says building on more than 20% year-on-year sales growth observed in the first quarter, “these policy pushes are expected to drive up electric car sales in Europe in 2025 to reach a sales share of 25%, despite flexibility given to automakers for meeting the 2025 EU emissions reduction target”.

“While the 2025 outlook for electric car sales in the United States is uncertain based on today’s policy direction, sales are currently expected to maintain the 10% growth observed in the first quarter; as consumers take advantage of existing tax credits in view of their potential repeal, electric car sales are projected to reach 11% of total car sales over the full year,” the IEA reports.

In emerging economies other than China, sales are projected to continue growing strongly, increasing by 50% to reach 1 million in 2025.

“Globally, EV adoption continues to grow unfettered, obviously led by China which continues to dominate and expand. General consensus – always a dangerous word – tends to lean strongly toward the future of the broader lithium market being a demand-driven story,” Ackerman tells Mining.com.au.

“EVs are just one part of that, with BESS, robotics, drones and other areas coming to the fore.

“The spectacular rise and fall of lithium price over the past several years showed just how volatile a somewhat nascent market can be as the fundamentals of supply and demand get sorted out. The world quickly learned that there is plenty of lithium out there, but how much of that which came into play was only economic at higher prices.

“That mania was short-lived but, just as the peak was unsustainable, the trough has been overdone, as well. Whether one sees some manipulation in the market or the oversupply or if it’s just a volatile course plotted due to battery storage and electrification still being in its infancy, the forward demand picture looks strong.”

Ackerman suggests the market will mature to where there is balance in those forces and a price point ultimately settled where project economics will dictate which of the more marginal projects gather dust and the exceptional projects will thrive.

He says there has been a more pronounced or, at least, public, push by nations around the world – whether in collaboration or purely domestic – to secure access to critical minerals supply as well as a recognition of the oversized role China has developed, to the point of supply chain dominance in many cases.

The most recent clear example of that, says Ackermanm, is the US Department of Energy acquiring a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and another 5% in their Thacker Pass project in Nevada.

“It will be interesting to see if / how this trend plays out. There’s a lot happening globally in all resource sectors. There is a renewed interest in domestic supply chains, specifically in North America,” he continues.

“Additionally, North America is also looking to accelerate the timelines it takes to get a mine into operation without compromising the necessary environmental work that needs to happen.”

Ackerman believes the market is young, volatile, and misunderstood, but heading for maturity.

“We’re entering the phase where price finds equilibrium, and that price will be much higher than today because supply simply cannot keep pace,” Ackerman adds.

Q2 Metals plans to deliver a maiden resource in 2026, backed by strong drilling results and investor interest.

Rebalancing and a reawakening

Killian Charles, CEO of Brunswick Exploration (TSX-V:BRW), just cuts through all the noise.

“People keep saying ‘EV demand is down’. It isn’t. EVs are still growing 20-30% annually,” he tells Mining.com.au, concurring with Healy and Ackerman.

“What’s changed is that lithium supply came online faster than expected. But that wave has peaked. Future supply growth is slowing dramatically.”

For Charles, the real story is renewables and energy access.

“Lithium isn’t just about cars. It’s about the grid. Without lithium, there is no large-scale renewable adoption. That demand will dwarf EVs.”

He forecasts the market will rebalance in the near term, with incentivising prices returning by 2028. By 2030, Charles expects a larger, more stable, less volatile market and far higher total demand.

“Broadly speaking, I expect a market rebalancing to occur throughout 2026 and into 2027 followed by incentivised pricing in 2028 and beyond. This is largely driven by significant demand growth,” Charles tells this news service.

“While much has been written about declining EV demand, this is largely a non-issue. Yes, EV sales are down but so are car sales in general. EVs as a proportion of total car sales are still increasing (reaching 25% on a global basis) even if most of these sales are predominantly Chinese driven.

“Typically, bear markets for commodities are driven by very weak demand growth and, at times, reducing demand. This is not observed in the lithium market.”

“Lithium isn’t just about cars. It’s about the grid. Without lithium, there is no large-scale renewable adoption. That demand will dwarf EVs”

Demand is still forecasted to grow by 12% per annum over the next five years, which Brunswick’s CEO notes is a “staggering” amount and remains the fastest growing commodity market. By 2030, he expects the market to start to mature.

“We have seen major swings in lithium prices over the last 10-15 years and this has underscored the immaturity of the market where the addition of a single mine or single new battery plant can cause huge imbalances,” Charles tells this news service.

“By then, one would expect the overall size of the market to better absorb new assets on the supply or the demand side. Not to say there won’t be swings in the price but they will be considerably dampened.”

Brunswick’ s CEO is also one of few speaking openly about geography.

“The next major supply won’t just come from Australia and China. Look at Québec, Brazil, Congo, Zimbabwe. That’s where growth is headed,” Charles continues.

Brunswick is advancing discoveries in Greenland and Quebec and expects a maiden resource at its Mirage project.

Energy storage the ‘real story’

Meanwhile, Patagonia Lithium (ASX:PL3) Executive Chairman Phil Thomas zooms out to the global stage.

“The lithium story is no longer just EVs,” he explains. “The real game is battery energy storage, grid stability, AI data centres, electrification of developing economies, and even electric aviation.”

Thomas tells this news service that demand could reach 2.5-3 million tonnes LCE by 2030, driven by renewable deployment and government mandates. He warns the current oversupply stage is temporary.

“By the early 2030s, we’re back in deficit. Recycling and new technologies help, but they won’t prevent shortages.”

Thomas sees lithium as strategic infrastructure, not a commodity.

“Nations will treat lithium the way they treat oil. National security, local content, supply chain control, it’s already happening,” he adds.

As such, Thomas says the lithium sector is at a pivotal juncture. While demand is set to increase significantly, supply challenges, investment needs, and geopolitical factors present complexities. Stakeholders across the value chain must navigate these dynamics to ensure a balanced and sustainable lithium market by 2030.

“However it’s unlikely to come from EVs as apart from China and Scandinavia the take up of EV cars is less than 8%. It’s most likely going to come from Battery energy storage systems,” he agrees.

According to the International Energy Agency, global lithium demand is expected to reach 531,000 tonnes by 2030, up from 165,000 tonnes in 2023. This surge is primarily driven by the electrification of transportation and the expansion of energy storage systems.

Similarly, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts lithium demand to reach 2.4 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2030, nearly 1.8 million tonnes more than current 2025 levels.

Patagonia is positioning brine resources to serve this shift, leveraging lower costs and policy support.

Why the next boom will be different

The next lithium boom is shaping up to be different. The EV market is still growing, battery storage is surging, AI/data centres are consuming huge power, and developing markets are now electrifying.

Lithium is no longer just a battery metal, it is the foundation of the energy, technology and geopolitical systems of the future. And the people actually building the mines know it.

Investors seem to have abandoned lithium at the exact moment demand is about to go parabolic. Supply is stalling. Capital is scarce. Timelines are long. And yet the world is about to need more lithium than at any point in human history.

Healy, Ackerman, Charles, and Thomas may differ in style but they are perfectly aligned on one thing – lithium’s current downturn marks the end of the beginning – not the beginning of the end.

Global lithium extraction is forecast to grow by more than 13% annually over the outlook period, to reach over 1.8 million tonnes of LCE by 2027.

Australia is expected to remain the leading lithium supplier with some 31% global share in 2027 down from 36% in 2024. In 2027, China’s share of global supply is expected to reach 29%.

Recent advances in salt roasting technology in China have led to a sharp rise in domestic lepidolite-based output, contributing to the current global oversupply.

Argentina is also expected to significantly expand lithium extraction capacity. China’s share of global extraction is forecast to increase from 25% in 2024 to almost 29% in 2027 through a combination of new brine and hard rock projects.

According to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources September 2025 Resources and Energy Quarterly, global primary lithium carbonate production is forecast to rise by more than 10% a year from 744 kt LCE in 2024 to 1,161 kt LCE by 2027.

China is expected to underpin this rise, increasing from around 59% in 2024 to over 66% in 2027. Presently, there’s no significant investment in facilities to process hard-rock feedstock into lithium carbonate outside of China. World primary lithium hydroxide production is projected to rise by more than 9% a year to 781 kt LCE by 2027.

While China’s production of lithium hydroxide is expected to increase from 397 kt LCE in 2024 to 537 kt LCE in 2027, its global share is set to fall from 86% to 69% over the period. This fall follows the ramp up of new lithium hydroxide production capacity amongst several emerging producers.

Meanwhile, Australia is projected to increase its share in global lithium hydroxide production to 9%, Indonesia will rise to 5%, US to 4%, and South Korea to 3% of world output.

Working with industry and government, we’re proud to be leading this effort to make hydrogen a cornerstone of our energy system.”","Energy companies have injected green hydrogen into Britain’s gas grid and used the low-carbon gas to generate electricity, in a landmark development for the UK’s climate ambitions.

For the first time in the UK, a 2% blend of green hydrogen was injected into the gas grid and blended with traditional gas to fuel the Brigg power station in North Lincolnshire which generated electricity for the power system.

Blending hydrogen into the gas system has already taken place in controlled environments using decommissioned sections of the transmission system, but the first “real-life” test in the UK was carried out by British Gas’s parent company, Centrica, and National Gas, which owns Britain’s gas transmission system.

The companies believe the test’s success shows the potential for hydrogen, which does not produce any carbon dioxide when burned, to cut harmful emissions from areas of the economy where other low-carbon options might not be available.

Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity from renewable energy sources, with minimal emissions. It is seen as key to decarbonising energy-intensive industries – although there is fierce debate over its use, with claims that heat pumps powered by electricity are much more efficient.

Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, said: “The success of this trial is a significant moment for our country’s energy future. It highlights the vital role that innovation across our industrial heartlands can play in creating highly skilled unionised jobs in working-class communities, an essential part of any credible plan to meet our net zero obligations.”

Centrica and National Gas are urging the government to back the use of hydrogen blends of up to 5% in the UK’s gas system.

Jon Butterworth, the chief executive of National Gas, said: “It’s another crucial milestone on Britain’s hydrogen journey, showing how blending can fuel our power stations and unlock new investment opportunities for producers.

A res­o­lu­tion sup­port­er, Sen­a­tor Dan Sul­li­van, R‑Alaska, cit­ed “the impact that this high­ly restric­tive plan would have on our nation­al secu­ri­ty, the mas­sive fed­er­al over­reach sti­fling eco­nom­ic devel­op­ment oppor­tu­ni­ties, and the dis­re­gard for Alas­ka Native voic­es” as BLM shaped the rule. An oppo­nent, Sen­a­tor Mar­tin Hein­rich, D‑New Mex­i­co, said can­celling the rule would allow con­struc­tion of “a 211-mile, pri­vate access road that would destroy some of Alaska’s wildest habi­tat and water­ways to pro­duce min­er­als — all for a for­eign com­pa­ny.” The vote was 50 yeas to 46 nays.

2026 MILITARY BUDGET: The Sen­ate on Octo­ber 9th passed the Nation­al Defense Autho­riza­tion Act (S. 2296), spon­sored by Sen­a­tor Roger F. Wick­er, R‑Mississippi.

REJECTING AMENDMENT ON FEDERAL RESERVE INSPECTOR GENERAL: The Sen­ate on Octo­ber 9th reject­ed an amend­ment spon­sored by Sen­a­tor Rick Scott, R‑Florida, to the Nation­al Defense Autho­riza­tion Act (S. 2296, above) that would have required Sen­ate con­fir­ma­tion of the inspec­tors gen­er­al nom­i­nat­ed for the Fed­er­al Reserve Sys­tem and the Bureau of Con­sumer Finan­cial Protection.

Scott said replac­ing the cur­rent approach of hav­ing the Fed­er­al Reserve chair­man appoint the inspec­tor gen­er­al would “bring true account­abil­i­ty to the Fed and ensure the cen­tral bank is work­ing in Amer­i­ca’s best inter­est.” An amend­ment oppo­nent, Sen­a­tor Gary C.

BARRING FUNDING FOR QATARI JET: The Sen­ate on Octo­ber 9th reject­ed an amend­ment spon­sored by Sen­ate Minor­i­ty Leader Chuck Schumer, D‑New York, to the Nation­al Defense Autho­riza­tion Act (S. 2296, above) that would have barred fund­ing for the pur­chase or oper­a­tion of an air­plane for­mer­ly con­trolled by a for­eign coun­try to use the air­plane for pres­i­den­tial air trav­el. In ref­er­ence to the planned use of an air­plane from Qatar by the pres­i­dent, Schumer said: “It is out­ra­geous that Pres­i­dent Trump wants to fly around the world like a king while Amer­i­cans are get­ting ham­mered by tar­iffs and pay­ing more for health­care, gro­ceries, rent, and electricity.”

An oppo­nent, Sen­a­tor Deb Fis­ch­er, R‑Nebraska, said the amend­ment, by block­ing the mil­i­tary’s use of a so-called Dooms­day Plane bought from Kore­an Air in the event of a nuclear war, “would affect one of our mil­i­tary’s most impor­tant pro­grams: the Sur­viv­able Air­borne Oper­a­tions Cen­ter.” The vote was 46 yeas to 50 nays.

Facts like this tend to undermine the reputation of the energy transition as the only way forward, with a net zero of acceptable alternatives.
Germany has been at the forefront of the energy transition, with massive wind and solar capacity, and yet it needs a lot of gas to survive the winter.
China has led the world in both oil and gas demand, and wind and solar installations for years now.
The warning came soon after the U.S. Energy Secretary suggested the IEA remember what it was set up to do—focus on energy security—and stop playing cheerleader for the energy transition.","Earlier this month, a top Shell executive warned that the Trump administration’s animosity towards offshore wind risks complicating investment decisions for oil and gas as well. Uncertainty was the word Collette Hirstius used. Uncertainty has become the dominant sentiment in energy circles—and it’s not just because of Trump.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Shell’s Hirstius said that “I think uncertainty in the regulatory environment is very damaging. However far the pendulum swings one way, it’s likely that it’s going to swing just as far the other way.” This is an apt observation, only it could be argued that Trump’s policy towards wind, and to a lesser extent solar, is also an example of the pendulum swinging back, after billions of dollars were spent on developing technologies that, contrary to predictions, did not bring electricity prices down. It is this failure of the transition promises to materialize that is changing sentiment in global energy.

Spain is a case in point. This spring, both Spain and Portugal suffered a devastating blackout that authorities and grid operators at the time refused to link to the amount of solar generation at the time. Now, Spain’s grid operator is warning that it could happen again because there are wild swings in voltage. The warning comes days after the European Union’s ENTSO-E—the bloc’s grid operators’ network—published its report on the April blackout, pointing to excessive voltage as the cause.

Excessive voltage is not something caused by gas, nuclear, or coal power plants. Swings in voltage are one of the less publicized properties of wind and solar installations, and the thing that forces curtailment during demand troughs, precisely to avoid blackouts. So, grid operators are essentially saying there is a problem with uncontrolled wind and solar, and it could be a serious problem. Facts like this tend to undermine the reputation of the energy transition as the only way forward, with a net zero of acceptable alternatives. So do facts like Germany’s vulnerability to energy price shocks as a result of insufficient gas reserves for the winter season.

Gas major Uniper warned this week that the country could face a bill of 40 billion euros, which is about $46.6 billion, if it failed to keep its gas reserve 90% full—something rather unlikely for peak demand season. Germany has been at the forefront of the energy transition, with massive wind and solar capacity, and yet it needs a lot of gas to survive the winter. Something clearly does not add up, widening the divide between what politicians want to have as an energy system and what is possible to have as an energy system—without blackouts.

This is clearly affecting investment decisions both in the wind and solar sectors, and in oil and gas. Caution is the new black in both parts of the energy world because this pendulum keeps swinging. The International Energy Agency recently issued a Renewables 2025 report, in which it predicted a 50% slump in wind, solar, EV and similar investments in the United States because of the Trump administration’s policies. But it also noted it had revised its growth numbers because of policy changes in China.

China has led the world in both oil and gas demand, and wind and solar installations for years now. China has been used both as an example of how to do an energy transition and as a demonstration that whatever the EU or, say, the UK does about its emissions, China’s emissions continue to grow, and quite significantly, offsetting any decline elsewhere and then some. Yet now China is building additional oil storage capacity while reining in its solar industries to put an end to what has become popular as a race to the bottom.

China, then, this transition leader, is effectively admitting that the subsidy-driven industry growth model does not work over the longer term. All it does is spur a race to the bottom, meaning intense competition, a downward spiral for prices and the resulting proliferation of negative bottom lines and ultimately company failures. Yet governments in European countries, Canada, and Australia are trying to replicate the Chinese model of subsidized transition.

While expecting this model to prompt the twofold increase in wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal capacity by 2030, the International Energy Agency warned the world needs to invest more in oil and gas because field depletion was happening faster than previously assumed. The warning came soon after the U.S. Energy Secretary suggested the IEA remember what it was set up to do—focus on energy security—and stop playing cheerleader for the energy transition.

Big Oil, meanwhile, is doubling down on its recent shift from low-carbon investments to core business, despite all the political uncertainty and complicatedness. Per its own admissions, the industry is doing what makes money—even without all the subsidies that wind and solar have enjoyed in the EU for years and enjoyed in the U.S. for quite a while as well.

Some say the world is bifurcating into those who know the energy transition could never work, so they are securing their future supply of hydrocarbons, and those who choose to ignore evidence of the above and continue to pursue decarbonization policies that only lead to more expensive and less reliable energy. They may well be right.

For Nova Scotia, the Benjamins Mill Wind Project marks a massive step toward renewable energy, but it's just the beginning.","Officials watched as the final turbine was installed on the Benjamins Mill Wind Project in Hants County, Nova Scotia. As CBC reported, this is a huge milestone on the path to the province hitting its 2030 renewable energy target.

In September, Halifax-based renewables firm Natural Forces completed the final installations for the Benjamins Mill Wind Project. Now nearing completion, the onshore wind farm will complete final tests before becoming operational and producing 33.6 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy. Each year, this wind farm alone can reduce harmful emissions by about 84,500 tonnes (over 93,000 tons).

""It's huge … a really big milestone for the project,"" said project construction manager Andrea Bradshaw, per CBC. ""There's a lot of work left to do after this in terms of mechanical and electrical completion, but, yeah, this is a big one.""

Nova Scotia is aiming to generate more than 300 MW of wind energy by the end of 2026. Currently, there are three other onshore wind projects in development in addition to the Benjamins Mill Wind Project. By 2030, Nova Scotia hopes to phase out coal and rely on renewable sources of energy, including wind and solar, to generate 80% of its power.

The burning of dirty fuels, such as coal, contributes to planet-warming pollution, adverse health effects, and more extreme weather disasters. Wind farms can reduce harmful emissions and water pollution while also having a minimal impact on wildlife and lowering electricity bills.

Developers hoped to have the Benjamins Mill Wind Project operational by last year, but studies on its impact have halted that timeline.

According to Robert Apold, a principal with Natural Forces, the project was selected to be a ""guinea pig"" for new approaches to renewable energy in Nova Scotia.

""Once the guinea pigs have gone through … I think we hit a rhythm, and once we hit the rhythm, it should be a lot easier from that point on,"" he told CBC.

Across the globe, both onshore and offshore wind farms are being built as an alternative to fossil fuels that can clean the air and produce renewable energy. In Egypt, a wind farm has recently come online, capable of powering half a million homes. In Stockholm, Sweden, a proposed offshore wind project could generate half of the city's power. Even in the U.S., wind farms are being built to power communities. Recently, a New York wind farm was completed that can power 70,000 homes and businesses.

For Nova Scotia, the Benjamins Mill Wind Project marks a massive step toward renewable energy, but it's just the beginning.

""We're always looking at what we need to reach our 80% renewables, and we believe we're well on our way,"" said Nova Scotia Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau in a press conference.

Despite some scrapped plans, energy companies are moving forward with new wind farm projects.

""ABO Energy Canada remains committed to our wind projects, with development activity continuing to move forward,"" said Sean Fleming, senior project manager of renewables at ABO, who recently scrapped a Nova Scotia project, per CBC.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-1307666876.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:01:14.583072

Decisions about how the money will be spent will return to Wales, honouring the UK Government’s manifesto commitment to restore decision-making on money that previously came from the EU.

The Welsh and UK Governments have agreed a framework which will set priorities and processes for allocating the funds, with a delivery plan developed and led by the Welsh Government.

Local authorities and other partners will have a key role in deciding how the funding is spent. Later this month, the Welsh Government will consult on the best way to use this funding through a consultation.

The Welsh Government is keen to understand how it can best:

support people into work and help people gain new skills and qualifications to progress into higher paid jobs, so that a larger proportion of the population is employed

help create and grow Welsh businesses in key sectors and boost investment in research and innovation, in areas such as health and bio-tech, financial technology, low carbon energy and AI

address the issues that are holding back growth, such as the need for key sites and premises, renewable and low-carbon energy generation, energy efficiency, and low-carbon transport.

First Minister Eluned Morgan said:

“Our new Local Growth Fund for Wales is a significant opportunity to support businesses and social enterprises to grow, export and innovate - particularly in high-growth sectors such as AI, cybersecurity and digital transformation. By tackling barriers like access to finance and encouraging investment in research and development, we can help build a more competitive and resilient Welsh economy.

“Supporting people into work and helping them progress is vital to reducing economic inactivity. By aligning skills development with the needs of our regional economies, we can ensure people across Wales are well placed for the jobs of the future.

“We’re keen to see a strong focus on green infrastructure, energy efficiency and local regeneration. We will encourage investment in renewable energy, low-carbon transport, and heritage. Tourism will be supported in a way that helps our communities thrive.

“I’m very pleased that, following agreement with the UK Government, decisions on the priorities in this fund will be made here by the Welsh Government.”

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

“This more than half a billion pound investment from the UK Government is key to driving economic growth in Wales, helping to grow businesses and get more people into good well-paid jobs.

“Decisions about how this money is spent are best made by people in Wales and we are working with the Welsh Government to achieve our shared priority of delivering growth, prosperity and opportunity across the country.”

Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, Rebecca Evans, said:

“This new fund will focus on supporting regional growth and productivity, as well as tackling economic inequalities.

“We will now work at pace with our partners to prioritise investment in each region.”

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was ""taking on big oil.""

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area. But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it. Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.” Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties. California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network. “We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said. But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies. “The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement. Life as an oil worker For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree. Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery. But there are downsides. Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work. Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years. “There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”

The shift appears to be largely due to credits’ unreliability in practice.

This seems like basic risk management. A long-term investment model can’t count on green energy tax incentives that can be repealed or defunded as quickly and easily as they’re passed. The implications could be bigger than one automaker or one credit. If multinational companies’ trust in tax incentives collapses, the entire premise of incentive-based industrial policy starts to unravel.

And corporations now have good reason to doubt those incentives’ enduring nature. Companies that bet big on the US clean energy transition during the previous administration lost big in July, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through a tax-and-spending package that clawed back a huge swath of green energy incentives created under the Inflation Reduction Act just three years earlier.

Electric vehicle credits are gone. Subsidies for clean hydrogen, wind, solar, and even nuclear energy are slashed. What was framed in 2022 as a decade-long runway for green investment became a cautionary tale on how quickly industrial policy can be uprooted by shifting political winds.

The short-term consequences of gutting green tax credits are clear: fewer projects, declining deployment of green technology, and lost jobs. The long-term effects may be less obvious and more difficult to fix. Once companies stop believing US tax policy is durable, they’ll stop building around it—reducing tax credits’ effectiveness in spurring investment.

If Volvo’s views are a bellwether, lawmakers soon will realize that they can only push and pull the tax incentive lever so many times before it breaks off in their hands.

The restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain.
As with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods.
In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity — enough to supply power for around 3 million homes — went online last year.
Trump and President Xi Jinping were expected to meet in South Korea later this month to broker a new trade deal.","China’s newly announced raft of restrictions on the export of batteries could have major impacts on US companies, analysts say.

Beijing has previously used rare earths as a tool in the trade war with Washington. But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.

The restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.

As with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.

“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.

In the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.

Battery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.

While China’s AI boom is constrained by access to advanced chips from the US, ​​”the energy demand piece is the constraint in the US for AI data center infrastructure,” said Emily Kilcrease, director of the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

Large-scale batteries help store excess renewable energy and release it when electricity is needed. That can help avert blackouts and bolster grid stability. Practically non-existent a decade ago, US utility-scale battery installation reached a total of 26 gigawatts in 2024. In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity — enough to supply power for around 3 million homes — went online last year.

As much as 136 gigawatts of new capacity is expected to be added across the country over the next decade, according to BNEF. Much of that supply will need to come from China and can’t be easily replaced by other countries, Hales said.

US battery manufacturing capacity has grown in recent years, but it can’t meet domestic demand for energy storage. Those factories will also be impacted by China’s new restrictions. The Asian nation controls about 96% of the world’s anode production capacity, according to BNEF, and 85% of its cathode capacity.

The inclusion of these key components in Beijing’s measures represents a “huge escalation,” because companies outside China are so reliant on them, said Cory Combs, head of critical minerals and supply chain research at the consultancy Trivium China.

“A lot of the battery factories that have been going up in the Southeast, they’re all going to be impacted by this — this is their raw material stream,” said Celina Mikolajczak, a battery executive who oversaw battery manufacturing for Tesla Inc. and Panasonic Corp.’s Nevada gigafactory.

Battery company Fluence Energy Inc.’s stock dropped more than 12% on Friday, the most since Aug 12, while Tesla shares fell 5%. Both companies rely in part on Chinese battery components.

The policy actions by China “add another layer of complexity to an already tight global supply chain and underscore the importance of accelerating domestic innovation,” said Denis Phares, the chief executive officer of Dragonfly Energy Corp., a battery manufacturer with an assembly plant in Nevada. The company is “actively working to reduce reliance on Chinese-sourced components as part of our long-term plan,” he said.

Export controls could also put China’s multibillion-dollar battery industry in the crossfire. In the face of overcapacity domestically, Chinese companies have become increasingly reliant on overseas markets, making it “unclear how China intends to enforce its new regime,” said Bryan Bille, a researcher on policy and geopolitics at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

There’s also another complicating factor: Analysts view China’s measures not only as a crucial source of leverage in trade negotiations, but also as a means to maintain its competitive edge.

“I think they've been very explicit about not wanting to give away core technologies,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, senior fellow focused on the Chinese clean energy industry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think they really are angling to become the leading power in this industry for decades to come.”

How much China ultimately decides to wield its battery leverage will likely depend in part on the outcome of trade talks. China allowed for the reinstatement of rare earth shipments to the US after reaching a deal with President Donald Trump’s administration in June.

Trump and President Xi Jinping were expected to meet in South Korea later this month to broker a new trade deal. But in response to China’s latest barrage of controls, Trump said there was “no reason” to attend the meeting and threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on China in a series of social media posts on Friday.

But this was not a foolish act, for the king was actually trying to show his foolish advisors the limits to power. Unfortunately, our self-proclaimed king not only has foolish advisors, but is foolish himself, believing whatever he says must be reality.

He foolishly believes the climate crisis is a hoax, so he props up aging fossil fueled plants and destroys efforts to address, or even monitor, climate changes already happening. Coal, a 19th century energy source, is expected to power 21st century AI data centers. Operating a coal fired plant costs more than building new wind/solar with storage. The Big Beautiful Bill cancels funding for wind and solar, mostly in Democratic-led states, unsettling the financial underpinnings of the entire U.S. energy industry. Without even considering the adverse climate impact, consumers will annually pay an extra $3 billion power bills. Electricity rates increased by nearly 7 percent in the last year, with more rate increases on the horizon.

After the mindless DOGE staffing purge, the Energy Department doesn’t have enough lawyers left to carry out the project cancellations ordered by the White House, and will instead have to spend millions on outside counsel.

There have been no major domestic nuclear accidents since Three Mile Island, partially due to Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight. Now, hundreds of people have been fired from the agency and only three of the five NRC commissioner positions are filled, making the recent push for more nuclear power increasingly risky.

Our king foolishly believes raising tariffs and excluding workers will make the country richer. As a result, the economy is suffering the highest tariffs in a century and consumers pay higher prices. John Deere, producer of machinery for many American farms, says sales are down, with higher tariffs increasing costs by $600 million. Tariffs on steel and aluminum led to losses of thousands of manufacturing job. Instead of reducing drug prices, tariffs have increased prices on almost 700 prescription drugs so far this year.

Farmers face a slump in crop prices and worsening credit conditions. Corn prices are down 50 percent, and soybean prices are down 40 percent, as overseas markets for crops are lost due to tariffs. With the massive assault on undocumented workers, farmers are caught in the middle of a 155,000-worker shortfall across the national agricultural sector, which means lower supply and higher prices.

Tariffs have weakened consumer spending, as jobs are evaporating, with sharp drops in home construction. One indication is a 9 percent decline in containerboard-production capacity in eight months, twice the capacity that was lost during the recession in 2009.

Nearly 30 countries have suspended postal services of packages to U.S. over import tariffs, including Australia, Japan, India, and Europe. After September 21, no H-1B worker will be allowed to enter the US unless the sponsoring employer pays a $100,000 fee. These are workers with specialized knowledge that no one local can fill.

Employment fell by 13,000 jobs in June, marking the first net loss since December 2020, with another 32,000 jobs lost in September. Last month, jobless claims surged in one week, when 263,000 new people filing for unemployment insurance, 10 percent higher than the previous week. Unemployment rate is 4.3 percent, the highest level since the pandemic. Rising unemployment and higher prices threaten economic stability. But instead of dealing with what they created, the administration fired the record keepers.

Billionaires benefit from tax cuts, while MAGA voters are bearing the brunt. A majority of Republicans now think he’s on the wrong track when it comes to the economy and tariffs. He promised tariffs would fill the U.S. Treasury, create millions of manufacturing jobs, and be paid by foreign countries. He insisted he could impose these tariffs without an act of Congress, and he would complete trade deals with 200 countries. He promised to end the war in Ukraine on Day 1, that Putin really wants to make a deal, and would soon stop attacking. He promised to reduce prices on Day 1.

None of this happened.

It doesn’t really matter whether the president knows he is lying, or is just delusional, believing whatever passes through his mind in any given moment. He is acting like a fool. What is more disturbing is the entire leadership of the Republican party seems willing to go along with this. It won’t end well.

Benson Investment Management Company, Inc. reported a new stake of 73,875 shares in ONEOK (OKE -2.85%) in its latest quarterly disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The estimated transaction value of $5.4 million represented 1.8% of the fund’s $292.7 million in reportable U.S. equity holdings.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

ONEOK, Inc. provides natural gas gathering, processing, storage, and transportation services, along with natural gas liquids (NGL) fractionation, storage, and distribution across the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.

The company leverages extensive midstream infrastructure and regulated pipeline assets to transport, store, and process natural gas and NGLs.

Its main customers include integrated and independent energy producers, natural gas and NGL marketers, propane distributors, municipalities, and industrial end users such as petrochemical and refining companies.

ONEOK, Inc. is a leading midstream energy company with a substantial footprint in natural gas and NGL infrastructure, operating over 17,500 miles of gathering pipelines and significant storage facilities. The company’s strategy focuses on essential energy infrastructure, supporting a competitive dividend yield. ONEOK’s scale, geographic reach, and integrated asset base enable it to serve producers and end users throughout major U.S. energy markets.

Foolish Take

Benson Investment Management’s new $5.4 million position in ONEOK adds exposure to energy infrastructure in a portfolio largely dominated by tech and metals. While the midstream operator’s shares have slid nearly 30% over the past year, Benson’s buy comes as the company posts strong underlying fundamentals and strong earnings growth.

In the second quarter of 2025, ONEOK reported net income of $853 million, up 9% year over year, and a 22% rise in adjusted EBITDA to roughly $2 billion, supported by higher volumes due largely to increased production in the mid-continent and Rocky Mountain regions. The firm is targeting $8 billion to $8.45 billion in full-year adjusted EBITDA and maintains a $4.12 annualized dividend, reinforcing its reputation as a stable, fee-based cash generator.

For Benson, ONEOK offers diversification and yield at a time when most top holdings—like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia—derive value from growth rather than income. The company next reports earnings on October 29.

Since 2022, the state has provided over $102 million to identify and replace lead service lines in approximately 160 communities.

“The Trump Administration fails to understand the importance of supporting local projects to get lead out of our drinking water.","BOSTON (WWLP) – The Trump administration has delayed the announcement of new lead pipe replacement grants in Massachusetts, forcing the state to pause the service line identification and replacement program.

The Healey-Driscoll administration stated that this funding pause will delay critical work in detecting and removing lead from drinking water systems across Massachusetts. Since 2022, the state has provided over $102 million to identify and replace lead service lines in approximately 160 communities.

Using existing grant funding, municipalities have recently completed 70 inventories by identifying lead service lines that remain in use. In March 2025, the Trump administration also delayed over $50 million in funds from the 2024 Lead Grant allocation project.

“Massachusetts has some of the oldest housing stock and water infrastructure in the nation, and lead service lines remain a threat to public health, particularly for young children,” said Governor Maura Healey. “The Trump Administration fails to understand the importance of supporting local projects to get lead out of our drinking water. This funding stimulates the economy with construction jobs, replaces outdated infrastructure, and most importantly, ensures that residents are drinking safe, clean water. The delay and uncertainty with announcing the new allotments have forced us to pause our Lead Service Line Replacement Program and pause these much-needed projects.”

Funding is allocated to the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The trust then partners with municipalities to select priority projects and ensure completion of critical programs.

“Once again, the Trump administration is delaying urgently needed funds and putting the health and safety of our children and their families at risk,” said State Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg, Chair of the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust. “These resources are essential to addressing a serious public health crisis. I strongly urge the EPA to release this critical funding to protect the well-being of people throughout every one of our communities.”

There is currently no timeline as to when funding for these projects will be released.",https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2024/10/67197110ba3158.43438121.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-12 16:01:25.179353

They used to say that politics is the art of the possible. Today, politics is the art of believing the impossible.

Think about the Gaza peace plan, rioting against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, cashless bail and transgenderism. On each, some would rather embrace comforting illusions than face unpleasant realities.

Confidence in the Gaza peace plan shows an unwillingness to take savages at their word, even when their word is written in blood. We are expected to believe that Hamas is now willing to lay down its arms and leave the Gaza Strip when its entire existence has been dedicated to the annihilation of the Jewish people.

Its charter calls for genocide. It has never negotiated with Israel directly but always through intermediaries. It’s never acknowledged Israel’s right to exist within any borders. On Oct. 7, 2023, it perpetrated the greatest one-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Whatever happens, Hamas will never give up and the misnamed peace process will leave Israel much more vulnerable.

The same air of unreality dominates the discussion of the terrorist war on ICE. In Portland, Oregon, the chaos has been going on for more than 100 days. Every night, protesters who look like demons summoned from the depths of hell attack ICE facilities.

In Chicago earlier this month, an ICE vehicle was rammed by up to 10 cars. Agents barely escaped with their lives, and Mayor Brandon Johnson, whose grasp of reality is tenuous at best, ordered police to stand down.

Attacks on immigration officers have increased 1,000% since Jan. 21. Drug cartels have placed $10,000 bounties on the heads of immigration enforcement officials.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker calls the president’s efforts to enforce federal immigration law and get violent illegal aliens off the streets an “invasion.” In a recent statement, he urged “every American [to] speak up and help stop this madness.”

Enforcing the law and deporting the worst of the worst have become the Trump invasion.

The same politicians who were telling us the border was secure two years ago (as millions of people crossed illegally into the United States) today insist that violent upheaval is lawful protest and there is no cause for alarm.

Elsewhere, crime continues to surge.

Cashless bail has helped paint city streets blood red, but the liberal Brennan Center for Justice insists, “There is no evidence connecting bail reform with crime rates.” Really?

A first-of-its-kind study by the Yolo County, California, district attorney’s office found a 169% increase in recidivism under no-cash bail. In early September, a ghastly murder, caught on camera, brought the issue into sharp focus. A 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee riding on public transportation in Charlotte, North Carolina, was stabbed to death.

Decarlos Brown Jr., who was charged with the crime, had 14 prior arrests over the course of two decades. The last time he was in court before Iryna Zarutska’s murder, a magistrate released him on his promise to show up for trial.

Nowhere is political schizophrenia more evident than in transgenderism.

Early this month, a Biden-appointed judge sentenced Nicholas Roske, who tried to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, to a surprisingly lenient eight years in prison. The Department of Justice had asked for 30 years. Among other mitigating circumstances that Judge Deborah Boardman considered was Roske’s so-called transgender identity. (He says he is someone called Sophie.)

The idea that someone can change their gender by changing their name or getting hormone treatment or surgery is self-evidently absurd. Nothing can alter DNA.

Yet men are allowed to play in women’s sports and boys are allowed into girls’ locker rooms on as little as a declaration that they “identify” as female.

The movement behind the fantasy is responsible for possibly irreversible operations performed on minors.

No wonder there’s so much rage here. Transgenderism provided the motivation for at least two school shootings and the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Illusions can be deadly.

As the left’s grip on our culture tightens, we march ever deeper into the happy land of make believe: Oz, Narnia and Neverland combined.

Don’t forget: In office, President Biden was at the top of his game, Hunter Biden’s laptop wasn’t real but the Steele dossier was and the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack was the worst act of insurrection since the firing on Fort Sumter.

It used to be that seeing is believing. Now it’s: Who are you going to believe, your lying eyes, your deceitful brain or our good old reliable elites?

By inviting world leaders, Trump seeks to project an image of dominance and international legitimacy, much like he did during his White House tenure.

Within the context of the Sharm El-Sheikh summit, issues such as identifying the aggressor, punishment, and compensation for the victims in Gaza have been sidelined. Legal and international bodies have accused Israel of genocide and war crimes; the International Criminal Court (ICC) is also active in this regard. However, the West seeks to downplay legal accountability by emphasizing the ceasefire and magnifying the appearance of peace.

Trump’s peace plan, which promised a permanent ceasefire, Hamas disarmament, and Gaza’s reconstruction, quickly faced resistance from the main parties. Hamas announced it would not attend the signing ceremony, and Israel stated it would not participate either. This response indicates that the current ceasefire is a tactical point rather than a fundamental and lasting agreement.

The Sharm El-Sheikh summit may serve merely to postpone subsequent U.S. initiatives. Trump appears intent on preparing the ground for future interventions, potentially shifting regional focus to other areas, such as Venezuela. This scenario represents a repeat of Washington’s “regional distraction” strategy, which it employs to advance its long-term objectives.

Photos and videos are available in the Greenpeace Media Library.

The messages Greenpeace Brazil projected on the Congress building and on buildings across Brasília, where delegates are meeting, read “COP 30: Act for forests, act for climate” in English; “COP30: Protejam as florestas” in Portuguese.

A staggering 86% of people surveyed in 17 countries across five continents believe that protecting forests is critical in the fight against climate change, according to the new poll, released today, commissioned by Greenpeace International and conducted by Opinium [1]. Results also showed that 82% of people want their governments to take more action on forests, showing overwhelming public support to halt deforestation.

An Lambrechts, Biodiversity Policy Expert, Greenpeace International said: “If we want to keep 1.5°C within sight, COP30 will need to deliver an action plan to end forest destruction by 2030. These poll results show that many people understand the urgency and want governments to act. There is no better moment than at a COP in the Amazon to do so.”

The polling was released during the pre-COP in Brasília, where country delegations, Indigenous communities and civil society are meeting ahead of the UNFCCC COP30 to prepare COP outcomes, including on the need to address climate change and biodiversity loss hand in hand.

Poll respondents expressed wanting to see their governments increasingly addressing forest destruction. Additionally, most agree that the most effective results can be achieved with global cooperation through international agreements to end deforestation (77%), and to commit to a new action plan to halt the destruction of forests and other ecosystems (75%). When it comes to forest protection, respondents place the most confidence in Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (78%), well above national governments (49%) or corporations (42%). 75% agree that Indigenous Peoples should receive funding to protect forests.

Carolina Pasquali, Executive Director, Greenpeace Brazil said: “This overwhelming public support sends a powerful message to governments ahead of COP30, which takes place for the first time in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. World leaders must listen to their people and act on their moral, legal and political responsibilities to end deforestation in order to hold on to the 1.5°C ambition.”

Kleber Karipuna, Executive Coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib) said: “This is a significant survey as it expresses not only the opinion of the vast majority of the population on the importance of keeping forests and all biomes standing and preserved, but also reveals society’s trust in Indigenous Peoples to protect the planet’s biodiversity. Science has already proven that Indigenous Peoples are the true guardians of the forest. Now, society is reaffirming this and warning that demarcating and protecting our territories is an effective and crucial policy for combating deforestation and confronting the global climate crisis, because we are the answer.”

For successful forest protection, Greenpeace calls on global leaders at Pre-COP to:

Act on their commitments and the UNFCCC target to halt deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, with a decision that goes beyond voluntary pledges [2].

Provide direct funding for Indigenous Peoples’ and Local Communities’ solutions to protect and restore forests.

Regulate and stop funding those who profit from forest destruction.

“Nigeria’s energy future is not a choice between opportunity and risk; it is a challenge to navigate both dynamics together,” he said.
“Success demands a multi-pronged strategy that leverages our strengths while confronting our vulnerabilities head-on.” Dr. Ogah framed Nigeria’s energy path as one of managing both opportunity and risk with discipline.

Speaking at the NAEC Energy Conference 2025, on the theme “Nigeria’s Energy Future: Optimising Opportunities and Addressing Risks for Sustainable Growth”, Dr. Ogah called for pragmatic reforms and sustained policy consistency to drive Nigeria’s energy transition.

Ogah acknowledged the transformative potential of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) of 2021 and the Electricity Act of 2023, noting that successful implementation would require deliberate coordination across government and industry.

“Nigeria’s energy future is not a choice between opportunity and risk; it is a challenge to navigate both dynamics together,” he said. “Success demands a multi-pronged strategy that leverages our strengths while confronting our vulnerabilities head-on.”

Dr. Ogah framed Nigeria’s energy path as one of managing both opportunity and risk with discipline. He referenced a Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) report indicating that national power generation remains below 50 percent of installed capacity due to gas constraints and transmission bottlenecks.

He identified three paramount challenges: ensuring reforms yield measurable results, maximising the value of hydrocarbon assets before the global decline accelerates, and providing affordable power to all citizens.

The Masters Energy boss emphasised that oil and gas remain the economy’s backbone, accounting for nearly 70 percent of export earnings and sustaining millions of jobs.

He stressed that gas commercialisation, through projects like the Utorogu Gas Processing Facility, is vital, describing gas as Nigeria’s strategic bridge fuel that powers industries, enables clean cooking, and can position the nation as an LNG export leader.

However, he warned that underinvestment, oil theft, and insecurity pose serious threats to the full implementation of the PIA.

Dr. Ogah stated that the global energy transition offers Nigeria the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century, highlighting the nation’s significant potential in solar, wind, and youthful human capital.

He urged the country to exceed its 30 percent renewable capacity target by 2030, arguing that inaction would risk turning Nigeria into a consumer or dumping ground for imported technologies.

He passionately declared, “We must not be consumers of the green economy; we must be creators within it.”

Dr. Ogah commended the Association of Energy Correspondents of Nigeria (NAEC) for maintaining vital dialogue across government, industry, and the media regarding the nation’s energy transformation.

He pinpointed three major growth frontiers: gas, renewables, and innovation.

He advocated for the development of utility-scale solar farms, mini-grids, and local solar manufacturing under the proposed Nigerian Solar Manufacturing Initiative. Furthermore, he identified blue hydrogen, biofuels, and critical mineral exploration as crucial pathways for industrial diversification, underscoring that every solution, “from solar in Olorunsogo to blue hydrogen in the Delta,” must serve both growth and sustainability.

The business leader outlined the main risks undermining energy development as policy inconsistency, infrastructure gaps, security concerns, and skills shortages.

He called for practical solutions, including establishing a single-window licensing system, modernising the national grid, and implementing benefit-sharing models to enhance investor confidence and community trust, observing that policy certainty attracts capital; community trust protects it.

On human capital, he proposed the creation of a National Energy Transition Academy and issued a strong caution against industrial unrest, referencing the recent PENGASSAN and Dangote Refinery dispute.

Dr. Ogah concluded that energy reform is a national, joint project, urging industry players to align with ESG principles, the government to deepen reform consistency, and journalists to sustain solution-driven energy reporting.

He rallied stakeholders toward a unified vision: “By optimising today’s hydrocarbon assets and building tomorrow’s clean-energy ecosystem, we can fuel sustainable growth for every Nigerian.”",http://www.environewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG-20251012-WA0011.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 16:01:05.663488

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who’ve lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he’s enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that’s set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/California_Oil_Workers_71412.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 14:01:59.700719

I want to take it back, I was wrong. Not just because UCLA went on to crush Michigan State for its second consecutive win — I guess the Bruins’ interim offensive coordinator figured out how to use his headset — but Northwestern beat Penn State yesterday, and as a Northwestern fan, I now feel strongly that it’s important to celebrate the team that pulls off an upset instead of just crapping all over the team that lost.

Is Penn State really in total freefall, or was it just outfoxed by the mighty Wildcat defense? Come on, guys! Isn’t it more fun to talk about how Northwestern’s offense is clicking with Preston Stone and Griffin Wilde than something boring like James Franklin’s job status? Guys? GUYS?!?!??!?!?!

HOOSIER DADDY

Four years ago, in the midst of a 38-3 loss to Rutgers, several hundred Indiana students ripped off their shirts and began jumping around the completely empty upper deck of Memorial Stadium, overcome with mass-onset Hoosier Madness:

That moment was easily the most most memorable thing about the 2021 Indiana Hoosiers, who finished 2-10 and 0-9 in conference play. Indiana experienced a glimmer of relevance during the 2020 COVID season, but it was still the losingest program in college football history, without a bowl win since 1991. The Hoosiers had no hope and no ambition — nothing to do except rip their shirts off and mosh, as far away as possible from the actual football taking place on the field.

Four years later, Indiana is still the losingest program in college football history, and it still hasn’t won a bowl game since 1991. And yet the undefeated Hoosiers have arguably the strongest resume of any team in the country. They are virtual locks to play in the Big Ten championship and the College Football Playoff after comfortably defeating #3 Oregon in Eugene.

The win was Indiana’s first over a Top 5 opponent since 1967. It had gone 0-46 against Top 5 competition over the previous 58 years. And the Hoosiers didn’t win a flukey, NCAA Tournament-style upset in which the underdog keeps hitting threes and the better team keeps missing layups. (Basketball terms for our adapting Hoosier friends.) Indiana was simply the better team. The Hoosiers moved the ball consistently, tracked down Oregon quarterback Dante Moore like Hoosier homing missiles, and stoned the Ducks in multiple short-yardage scenarios. If not for an atypical Fernando Mendoza pick-six, literally his first interception of the year, the game wouldn’t have been particularly close.

Indiana’s overnight leap in success from 2023 to 2024 was one of the biggest in college football history. Curt Cignetti and his transfers took Indiana to the College Football Playoff out of nowhere in their first year in Bloomington. But Indiana may have taken a bigger leap in Year 2, going from a solid team that was clearly outclassed by the best programs in the sport to a legit national title contender.

Going from bad to good quickly has happened before. Going from good to elite typically takes significantly longer, and requires major structural changes. Just ask Oregon, which has risen from football obscurity to powerhouse status through decades of strategic planning and billions of dollars invested by a single benefactor, the founder and CEO of the largest athletic clothing brand ever. Oregon couldn’t break through overnight. It has had to build wisely by hiring the right people and spending in the right ways, creating systems that would enable it to beat the best teams in the sport. In 2025, the Ducks looked as if they finally made it to the top: They had the right coach, who was able to land the best recruits from all over the country and get them to buy in.

And then Indiana came into their house and kicked their asses with a year-and-a-half of Curt Cignetti and nothing else. These Hoosiers aren’t the result of careful planning. They are just four years removed from being so directionless and incoherent that “shirtless dance party?” was a defining ethos.

Indiana can win the national championship. It hasn’t shown any flaws and, unlike last year, its schedule isn’t lacking. The Hoosiers entered this week as the #3 team in Bill Connelly’s SP+ ratings and just beat the #1 team on the road. Indiana’s opponents this year are 22-4 against Not Indiana, and 0-6 against Indiana.

I can’t explain how Indiana did it. I have no road map for the next team who wants to replicate its success, because there’s only one Curt Cignetti and Indiana already hired him. But Oklahoma State fans had the next-best idea this weekend: A random Shirtless Section during Saturday’s 39-17 loss to Houston in a cargo cult attempt at recreating Indiana’s rise.

See you in the 2030 national championship game, Pokes.

Fun fact about the Hoosier Madness incident: Our friend, Mr. Homefield Apparel, was in the crowd that day, watching all those freezing, frenzied students and all those Rutgers touchdowns:

It was that day that Mr. Homefield came up with an idea: What if people could cover their upper bodies in some form of garment? Perhaps made out some sort of cloth or fabric? Not only could these “shirts” provide warmth and comfort to the wearer, they could feature words or images that represent things the wearer is passionate about.

Everything has changed in the past few years. Indiana has become a national contender. Homefield’s invention of “shirts” has been copied by rival brands, but everybody agrees that they are the originator and the best. They’ve even expanded to products such as their new Homefield Varsity Jackets, which are SICK. (Oregon fans, cheer yourself up with that vintage Duck!)

Oops, they did it again

If its loss to UCLA was an alarm, Penn State hit snooze. It looked just as flat and lifeless against Northwestern as it did the week before. Perhaps even worse. The Nittany Lions started putting up points after falling into a hole against the Bruins. On Saturday they never woke up.

Penn State is now the first team ever to lose back-to-back games as a 20-point favorite. It won’t be a 20-point favorite again this season, especially after quarterback Drew Allar went down with a season-ending injury.

Normally, when I hear people doom-and-glooming about a couple of weird losses, I think they’re being overreactive … but considering the context around Penn State, the reaction feels appropriate. This season was supposed to be the culmination of talent and program-building under 12th-year head coach James Franklin. When I previewed Penn State for Split Zone Duo’s Big Ten preview, I saw a complete team with elite, experienced players at virtually every position. Allar seemed poised for a star turn in his final season after years of development. The biggest question mark was the receiver room, so Penn State spent big on multiple high-quality transfer receivers to plug the gap.

This season was everything Penn State was building towards … and in two weeks, it has crumbled and collapsed.

A Smart move

I’m trying to decide: Is Kirby Smart a liar, a genius, or a just really convincing salesman?

On a key third down in the fourth quarter against Auburn, Smart sprinted towards the officials signaling “timeout.” The refs granted Georgia a timeout with one second on the play clock, preventing a delay of game. However, Smart told the officials that he actually wasn’t timeout. He explained that he was just clapping at them, and in their confusion, they misinterpreted his hand gestures. The officials, remarkably, bought the explanation, and did not charge Georgia with a timeout. The Bulldogs got a fresh play clock, which is the intended effect of calling a timeout, without actually having to use one.

Here’s the weird thing: Smart may have been telling the truth. Yes, he was clearly running down the sidelines doing the “timeout” gesture. But he explained after the game that he was trying to tell the referees that Auburn players were clapping before the snap to trick Georgia into snapping the ball early, simulating the claps the Bulldogs were using to trigger the snap in a loud road environment. Smart said he alerted officials to Auburn’s use of this illegal trick before the game, and that he’d lost games at Auburn because of it. (Not sure which games Kirby is referring to, but Auburn did use a clap to trick Alabama into a bad snap during the Iron Bowl in 2023, setting up a fourth-and-31 … which Alabama famously converted!)

And sure enough, if you look at the play in question, Auburn defenders were clapping before the snap! The Tigers should’ve been given a five-yard penalty.

So I’m a little confused. On one hand, I believe Kirby Smart when he says he was trying to get in the refs’ ears about Auburn’s clapping. The Tigers clearly have a history of doing it, they were clearly doing it Saturday, and Smart is clearly fed up with it. I’m a little skeptical that Kirby would freak out so aggressively just to trick the refs into giving him one free timeout, especially with so much time remaining.

But on the other hand … we have the video, and he was clearly making the timeout gesture and not clapping.

One thing is clear: Auburn can’t stay away from bad officiating scenarios. It had a goal line QB sneak that kinda looked like a touchdown turn into a fumble on Saturday night. And of course, they were on the wrong end of this:

I guess Hugh Freeze freaking out at officials gives them the ick and convinces them to make even more calls against Auburn, and Kirby Smart freaking out at officials causes them to rethink the calls they’ve already made. A useful skill!

Oklahoma rushed QB John Mateer back from surgery on his throwing hand for the big Red River matchup with Texas … and he looked like a guy who got rushed back from surgery on his throwing hand as Oklahoma lost, 23-6.

UNLV stayed undefeated by beating Air Force, 51-48, and has a legit chance at the G6 spot in the College Football Playoff. Air Force is now dead last in the nation in total defense, allowing 497 yards per game. Honestly, I’m a bit worried about our national security at this point.

I’m not writing about the latest embarrassing Bill Belichick loss … because UNC was on bye. We’ll be back next week.

Boise State pulled off the extremely rare botched snap-to-touchdown pass Saturday night. I honestly can’t remember the last time I saw this …

This sort of thing used to happen more often when teams used backup quarterbacks to hold kicks in case the snap went bad and they needed a QB to make a play. But now teams use full-time long snappers who are almost always perfect, and most use a punter as the holder because it’s just easier to let the special teams guys hang out with each other in practice. Long story short: This was an Aussie Rules convert, Oscar Doyle, likely throwing a pass for the first time, under extreme duress … and dropping in a perfectly placed pass with touch on the run!

Oregon State wishes they could do this. The Beavers have had the most disastrous special teams season in recent memory with a variety of blocked kicks, allowed return touchdowns, and missed field goals. They tried to fix their problems by firing their special teams coordinator … and had yet another kick blocked on Saturday.

I’m still stumping for the two-QB offense. Look at this play Washington State ran for a touchdown against Ole Miss:

The ball was snapped to backup QB Julian Dugger, who handed it off to starter Zevi Eckhaus, who the defense clearly read as a runner rather than a QB. He briefly faked an option look before wheeling around and tossing a TD to a wide-open receiver.

Iowa State’s starting kicker was hurt entering Saturday, and then its backup kicker got hurt mid-game. So the Cyclones turned to Carson Rhodes, a 310-pound offensive lineman who punted and played soccer in high school.

Can we get any footage of this 310-pound guy playing soccer?

Kent State won its first game against another FBS team since 2022 … and it wasn’t close! The Golden Flashes beat UMass, 42-6. The winless Minutemen seem significantly worse than any other team at this level.","https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/ERo1bP2tDqs",N,,2025-10-12 14:02:39.022565

DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor Co. on Thursday said it won’t file for federal plug-in vehicle tax credits for transactions after the program’s deadline, following a similar decision by General Motors Co.

The Dearborn automaker will continue to offer its current lease rates to customers but will not claim the tax credit of up to $7,500. The incentive ended on Sept. 30, but Ford and GM through their finance arms found a workaround to extend that taxpayer-funded discount.

Following pressure from Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican and former auto dealer, to abandon the scheme, however, both companies have withdrawn their plans.

“Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today to continue providing customers with more affordable electric vehicle options,” Ford spokesperson Said Deep said in a statement. “For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0% financing for 72 months and other incentives.”

The automakers had their finance arms put down payments on dealers’ in-stock electric vehicles ahead of the deadline in an effort to extend the discount. CEO Jim Farley had characterized it as a way to “transition” customers away from the government incentive.

Now the companies will foot the discount themselves. Ford’s EV lease deals are expected to extend through the rest of the year.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that India will remain a major export hub for onshore wind components, underscoring the country's expanding role in the global renewable energy supply chain. ""Since 2023, the share of Western OEMs in the domestic market has declined sharply – from over 50% on average between 2018 and 2022 to below 5% – as their focus shifted to core US and European markets. This has left several gigawatts of manufacturing capacity underutilised and oriented towards exports. At the same time, Indian and Chinese manufacturers are planning expansions, says IEA. For the first time, large-scale supply contracts have been awarded to Chinese manufacturers in India and several other countries. India currently boasts more than 20GW of wind turbine manufacturing capacity, catering to both domestic demand and export markets. The country India has established itself as a global manufacturing hub for WTG components, with a strong supplier network and expanding capacities across key Tier 1 (nacelle, blade, tower) and Tier 2 (gearbox, generator, converter, casting) segments, ensuring global competitiveness, according to Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). India stands at the threshold of becoming a global hub for wind manufacturing — where localisation goes beyond producing turbines and supply chain components for the domestic market. The focus is now on building global competitiveness through advanced capabilities, a skilled workforce, and strong local supply chains,"" Francis Jayasurya, director, GWEC India told TOI. Indian manufacturers account for about 12% of the global nacelle manufacturing capacity, contributing roughly 20GW out of a global total exceeding 165GW. In blade manufacturing, India holds a 10% share, with a capacity of around 16GW from a global base of more than 157GW. For towers, Indian firms contribute 13%, amounting to about 15GW of the global capacity exceeding 115GW. The country's strongest presence is in gearboxes, where it commands 17% of global capacity, equivalent to 29GW out of more than 170GW worldwide, says GWEC data. India aims for 500GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030, including 100GW from wind (30GW offshore).

Houston has the worst power outages in the nation; how bad is it in your ZIP code? | KPRC Houston

Some zip codes in the Houston area had as many as seven outages in August. There were no hurricanes, no historic heat waves – just a lot of blue-sky outages.

In this story from KPRC, Senator Lois Kolkhorst pledged to do something about it. Good – except Senators said they’d do something about utility failures after Beryl and did very little.

It’s time the Legislature prioritizes pay for performance: give utilities both upside and downside risk based on the total amount of outages and speed to restore service after a storm.

I wrote about it after Hurricane Beryl a year ago:

The government’s own data rebuts Trump’s claims about wind and solar prices | Politico

The Administration continues to make demonstrably false claims about renewables. Politico did an excellent job putting together the evidence.

“Adding more wind and solar to the grid have one guaranteed effect: They make electricity more expensive,” Wright, a former oil industry CEO, told reporters last month in Washington.

But federal energy data undermines those arguments.

“I really think the data say pretty much the opposite” of Wright’s claims, said Joshua Rhodes, an electricity grid expert at the University of Texas-Austin whose research has found that renewable power has lowered electricity prices for customers in Texas, a state where wind and solar produce more than 30 percent of the state’s mix.

According to the EIA figures, Texas’ power cost an average of 10.24 cents per kilowatt-hour in June of this year. That price was lower than electricity costs in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and seven other Southern states. Only Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma had cheaper power in the South.

More broadly, EIA data shows that states that have been the quickest to add wind and solar generation to the grid have had lower power prices.

A majority of the 32 states with the fastest rising renewable resources voted for Trump and have Republican governors. The Administration’s policies will hurt those states.

And it’s not just renewables the Administration is hurting…

High natural gas prices and skyrocketing electricity demands from AI workloads are pushing operators toward this carbon-intensive option, according to a recent report from The Register. The publication highlights how utilities in regions like the Midwest and Appalachia are delaying coal plant retirements or even ramping up production to meet the surge, with data centers projected to consume up to 8% of U.S. electricity by 2030.

This shift comes amid broader industry pressures, where tech giants like Google and Microsoft are racing to expand their computing infrastructure. The irony is stark: companies pledging net-zero emissions are indirectly bolstering the dirtiest fossil fuel, as coal’s reliability trumps intermittent renewables in the short term.

The AI Boom’s Hidden Energy Cost

Analysts at Jefferies, as cited in The Register’s analysis, note that natural gas prices have spiked 50% in the past year due to export demands and supply constraints, making coal economically viable again. Data centers, which can require gigawatts of power equivalent to small cities, are negotiating direct deals with utilities to secure stable supplies, often at the expense of cleaner alternatives.

Environmental advocates warn this could undermine U.S. climate goals, with coal emissions potentially rising 10-15% in key states by 2026. Yet, for operators, the math is simple: AI training models demand constant, uninterruptible power that solar or wind can’t always guarantee without massive battery backups.

Utilities Adapt to Surging Demand

The Department of Energy’s latest report, referenced in related coverage, forecasts domestic data center energy use doubling by 2028, driven by generative AI. This has utilities like those in Virginia and Texas extending coal plant lifespans, with some facilities that were slated for shutdown now being retrofitted to serve hyperscale campuses.

Industry insiders point to specific examples, such as Rainbow Energy’s plans in North Dakota to power a 300MW data center directly from the state’s largest coal plant, as detailed in reports from Data Center Dynamics. Such colocation strategies minimize transmission losses but lock in fossil fuel dependence.

Balancing Innovation and Sustainability

Tech firms are not idle; investments in nuclear small modular reactors and geothermal energy are accelerating, but these solutions won’t scale until the 2030s. In the interim, coal fills the gap, with global data center electricity demand expected to double by 2026, per the International Energy Agency’s findings echoed in The Register.

Critics argue this is a short-sighted fix, potentially inflating energy costs and regulatory scrutiny. For instance, Duke Energy’s updated carbon plan gambles on coal for data center growth, citing Trump-era rollbacks on pollution rules, as reported by NC Newsline.

Looking Ahead: Policy and Tech Intersections

As the sector evolves, collaborations like Babcock & Wilcox’s agreements to convert coal plants to gas hybrids signal transitional paths, though full decarbonization remains elusive. The McKinsey report on AI’s power hunger underscores opportunities for investors in resilient infrastructure, but warns of grid strains without coordinated policy.

Ultimately, this coal resurgence tests the tech industry’s green commitments, forcing a reckoning between rapid innovation and environmental responsibility. With AI’s exponential growth showing no signs of slowing, stakeholders must navigate these tensions to forge a more sustainable path forward.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-fdfcf03b-da8a-4e45-8ce0-943dd4854932.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 15:01:31.797803

Kinew says every day the tariffs remain in place, the harm to Prairie producers deepens.
China charges a 76 per cent tariff on Canadian canola seed imports and a 100 per cent tariff on canola oil, meal and peas.
China also put a 25 per cent tariff on certain Canadian pork, fish and seafood products.
Ford did not mention the canola tariff in his letter to Carney.","Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew is asking the prime minister to scrap Canada's 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in return for China lifting its tariffs on Canadian canola and pork.

Kinew says in a letter to Mark Carney on Saturday that while he believes protecting Canada's vehicle industry is important, he says the country's approach ""has created a two-front trade war that disproportionally affects Western Canada.""

The premier says in the letter that China's tariffs — widely seen as a response to Canada imposing the electric vehicle levy — have already caused a sharp drop in canola prices and that one vertically integrated pork producer in Manitoba is reporting a $19 million negative impact on an annual basis.

Canada imposed the electric vehicle duty last year in lockstep with the United States, which also has a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles, with Canada arguing the measure is meant to protect the country's automobile industry.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has previously said he wanted Ottawa to do away with the electric vehicle tariff, but only if the country remained on good terms with the United States, and he has since said removing it would not be a simple fix.

Kinew says every day the tariffs remain in place, the harm to Prairie producers deepens.

""Canada's trade policy must balance long-term industrial goals and national security with immediate economic realities as well as the national responsibility to grow every region of Canada's economy ,"" Kinew said in his letter to Carney.

Kinew noted that the Chinese ambassador to Canada also recently said that China would be prepared to lift its tariffs on canola and pork in exchange for Canada removing the tax on Chinese electric vehicles.

CTV reported that Wang Di made the pledge through an interpreter during an interview for its program Question Period, which aired Sunday morning.

Kinew called it a ""critical moment"" and urged Carney's government to ""seize the opportunity.""

The ambassador said in an opinion piece posted on the embassy's website Thursday that the tariff on Chinese-made EVs contravenes World Trade Organization rules, and removing it ""will once again highlight the image that Canada has been trying to establish as an advocate for a rules-based international economic and trade order.""

China charges a 76 per cent tariff on Canadian canola seed imports and a 100 per cent tariff on canola oil, meal and peas. China also put a 25 per cent tariff on certain Canadian pork, fish and seafood products.

Ottawa has accused Beijing of unfairly subsidizing its electric vehicle industry and flooding international markets with cheap cars to gain a competitive advantage.

Ottawa said last month it was reviewing its decision to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, but is offering no clarity on when the review started or when it might conclude.

The tariffs took effect on Oct. 1, 2024.

At the time, the regulatory order introducing them stated the measure would be reviewed within one year of implementation.

Figures last week show Saskatchewan's canola exports to China have taken a nosedive, with data showing that Saskatchewan's exports to China fell to $96 million in August, a 76 per cent drop when compared with the same month last year.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a letter to Carney last month that Canada must maintain its 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles as Ottawa looks to secure a new trade deal with the U.S. and protect Canada's auto sector.

Why solar is the practical answer Egypt still makes most of its electricity from natural gas.
By May 2025, Egypt had about 7.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewables (solar, wind, and hydro combined).
As for newer projects, on 15 June 2025, Egypt secured financing for a 1-GW solar plant with Scatec, the largest solar developer in Egypt.
Why Egypt’s sun gives solar an edge Egypt is also a naturally sunny place to tune more to this natural resource.","You wake up in the small hours, the air is thick, and the fan has stopped. Or you are halfway through an online class, a meeting, or a study session, and the screen goes black. That was the soundtrack of last summer for many homes across Egypt, as scheduled power cuts moved from rumour to routine.

The pattern had a cause. In the summer of 2024, and again in 2025, a fierce heatwave hit Egypt, putting a toll on electricity. The government in June 2024 resorted to three-hour power cuts while it scrambled for extra fuel. This is called “load-shedding”, a scheduled switch-off of electricity to save fuel.

To plug the gap of fuel shortage, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly stated in June 2024 that Egypt needed USD 1.18 billion worth of fuel (EGP 56.6 billion). Officials said the cuts would stop in July 2024 once extra gas shipments arrived. The message was simple: when gas is tight, lights go off or the fuel bill jumps.

Why solar is the practical answer

Egypt still makes most of its electricity from natural gas. When local gas falls short, the country buys Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from abroad. Egypt is negotiating LNG supplies with Qatar, Algeria, and Saudi Arabia, and has signed deals with Shell and Total Energies for cargoes in early 2025. In 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that Egypt is buying more LNG and chartering three extra FSRUs (floating terminals that turn LNG back into gas) to cover demand. The Cabinet also said Egypt would import LNG from July 2025 to June 2026 to get through the next summer. These steps keep the grid running, but they are expensive compared with building more local solar.

The strategic answer is to raise the share of clean power. In 2023, the government revealed its plans for renewables to supply 42 percent of Egypt’s electricity by 2030. Today, renewables supply about 11.5 percent of Egypt’s electricity, as per the latest government figure reiterated publicly at COP27 in late 2024, meaning the country would need to roughly quadruple the share of clean power in the mix by 2030 to meet its goal.

In late 2024, Madbouly called for global finance to upgrade the grid. Hitting the 42 percent target means adding big solar and wind plants and also connecting smaller systems on rooftops, schools, and businesses.

By May 2025, Egypt had about 7.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewables (solar, wind, and hydro combined). A year earlier, the country had roughly 7.4 GW; 4.6 GW of wind and solar, plus 2.8 GW of hydropower. In plain terms: total clean capacity grew year-on-year, even after the big wave of solar construction at Benban earlier in the decade. The Benban Solar Park near Aswan remains the anchor of Egypt’s solar fleet, together producing about 1.5–1.65 GW for the national grid.

As for newer projects, on 15 June 2025, Egypt secured financing for a 1-GW solar plant with Scatec, the largest solar developer in Egypt. Together, they signed a USD 600 million (EGP 28.8 billion) investment and a power-purchase agreement for 900 MW of wind worth USD 1 billion (EGP 48 billion).

Smaller systems matter as well. Homes, shops, and campuses can connect under net metering, which means you use your solar power first and send any extra to the grid for credits on your bill. They are most effective for users with significant daytime consumption and in tariff bands where daytime rates are higher. The regulator’s current tariff table, in force since 1 September 2024, shows what you pay per kilowatt-hour on each band, so heavy daytime users (workshops, clinics, schools) can see their likely payback more clearly.

Why Egypt’s sun gives solar an edge

Egypt is also a naturally sunny place to tune more to this natural resource. National and World Bank-backed tools show strong solar resources: around 3,000 hours of sunshine a year in many areas, and high solar radiation from the Nile Valley to Upper Egypt. More sun hours and stronger radiation mean each panel can generate more electricity.

Yet, there is still a bottleneck to solve: the grid. Think of the grid as the “roads and bridges” of electricity: the big pylons (high-voltage lines) and substations that carry power from where it is made (Benban in Upper Egypt, wind in the Gulf of Suez) to where it is used (Cairo, the Delta, industrial zones). Currently, those “roads” are busy, and some stretches are too narrow for the extra traffic from new solar and wind plants. That is why even with lots of sunshine and ready investors, projects can be delayed until there is space on the lines.

First, less than 12 percent of Egypt’s nearly 60 GW of installed capacity was renewable as of mid-2024, meaning most power still came from gas and older plants. Second, the national renewables total did rise 0.3 GW year-on-year, from mid-2024 Mid 2025; however, to reach the desired 42 percent by 2030, a lot more new projects must be plugged in quicker than the infrastructure can currently cater.

Officials say they are fast-tracking clean-energy connections through the Under Egypt’s Nexus for Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) platform so priority projects can feed power into the network before peak summer demand.

To make that possible, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (EBRD) is in parallel financing a grid-reinforcement project. A new 500 kV substation in Cairo and about 200 km of new 500 kV lines, which will move solar from Upper Egypt, where it’s sunny, and wind from the coastal area into areas of major loads.

The bank’s documents describe the substation as “crucial for the stability of the network” and say the upgrade is directly linked to closing the Shoubra El-Kheima gas plant without risking supply. In simple terms; more high-voltage lines in addition to bigger substations result in more room for solar and wind to flow, fewer bottlenecks, and less need for emergency fuel in hot months. Without these wires and substations, new solar fields cannot deliver their power to homes or shops, even if the panels are already in the desert.

Put simply, last year’s blackouts showed the cost of relying on gas alone. This year’s plan is to buy time with imported fuel while adding more solar and wind, large and small, and strengthening the grid that carries them.",https://egyptianstreets.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 16:01:20.778339

“This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.” WILMINGTON, Del.
In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.
“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said.
Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source.","“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Matt Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.”

WILMINGTON, Del. (Oct. 6, 2025) — Energy policy took center stage early Monday as Dave Stevenson, director of the Caesar Rodney Institute’s Energy Policy Center, joined A Better Delaware Chair M. Jane Brady for the latest installment of a weekly public webcast, “A Better Discussion.” At the 8 a.m. session, Stevenson urged Delaware lawmakers to embrace small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and roll back state carbon-pricing mandates, which he says have driven up electricity costs and risked grid reliability heading into winter.

But while Stevenson and Brady see nuclear energy as part of Delaware’s long-term solution, Governor Matt Meyer and environmental advocates are taking a more cautious — or opposing — stance.

In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.

“Delaware families and businesses are facing rising energy costs,” Meyer said. “We owe it to them to explore every possible solution to provide reliable, affordable, and clean energy.”

He added that nuclear deserves review, but not without scrutiny.

“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts before any decisions are made.”

Not all advocates agree the study is worthwhile. In its 2025 Legislative Recap, published in July, the Delaware Chapter of the Sierra Club reaffirmed its opposition to nuclear power as part of the state’s future energy mix.

The group instead urged lawmakers to:

Prioritize renewables such as solar and wind paired with battery storage;

Invest in energy efficiency and demand reduction, the most cost-effective strategies;

Avoid “costly, slow, and risky” nuclear projects that could leave waste and safety burdens; and

Focus on regional grid improvements and renewable integration rather than new nuclear feasibility studies.

The Sierra Club summarized its position by saying that while Governor Meyer believes nuclear “deserves careful study,” the organization sees it as “a distraction from cleaner, faster, and safer solutions.”

Stevenson’s Case for Nuclear

Stevenson said Delaware’s decarbonization mandates — not PJM’s market design — are “the root of reliability and cost problems.” He warned that “we could be looking at a blackout this winter” and claimed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) adds “about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal and 1 cent for natural gas,” making local generation uncompetitive.

He said Delaware now imports roughly 60 percent of its electricity.

Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source. Stevenson said three units could supply Delaware’s entire power needs — “two at the Indian River site and one at Edgemoor.”

“These modern reactors are smaller, safer, and can operate with almost no evacuation zone beyond the plant fence line,” Stevenson said.

Cost, Jobs, and Timeline

Stevenson compared energy costs at about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour for natural gas, 8 cents and falling for nuclear, and 18 to 20 cents for offshore wind, noting that offshore wind “runs a little over a third of the time” and has a lifespan of about 20 years compared with 80 for nuclear.

He said federal tax incentives and grants could make Delaware an early mover.

“With acreage and transmission already at Indian River, you could colocate a data center and use the power on-site,” he said.

Citing University of Tennessee research on a similar project near Oak Ridge, Stevenson said Delaware could generate $3.5 billion in economic impact and 1,800 direct jobs by constructing three SMRs.

Recycling Nuclear Fuel

Stevenson also discussed advances in reprocessing, saying that 95 percent of spent nuclear fuel can now be recycled, turning a waste challenge into a potential $40 billion-per-year national industry.

He said draft federal legislation could allow states to bid for temporary storage and recycling facilities, potentially creating high-wage jobs tied to the next generation of nuclear technology.

Policy Path Forward

Both Brady and Stevenson agreed Delaware should avoid repeating past decisions to close plants before replacements were ready.

“If we act quickly, we could become a net exporter of energy,” Brady said. “Stable, low-cost power could attract businesses and data centers to Delaware.”

Stevenson added that combining SMRs with ending the state’s carbon tax “would restore reliability, lower rates, and position Delaware for growth.”

What Is a Small Modular Reactor?

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are compact nuclear plants built in factories and shipped for installation. Their design allows for passive safety systems, shorter build times, and smaller sites — often on the grounds of retired fossil-fuel plants that already have grid connections.",https://milfordlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/transmission-electric-lines.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 14:01:43.977820

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who’ve lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he’s enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that’s set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://www.informnny.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2025/10/68eb94eabca6a2.18824617.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-12 14:02:07.914930

The Trump administration has been terrible for climate protection. We can stop some of what the administration is trying to do, and we can slow down some more. Our most powerful tool right now is suing the Trump administration. Federal judges decide “against Trump in about 95% of cases,” according to University of Chicago Law professor Aziz Huq.

The administration’s legal losses have created a wave of headlines: “Trump expresses frustration as judge temporarily blocks troop mobilization to Portland.” “Appeals court blocks Trump from removing Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve board.” “Judges appointed by Trump keep ruling against him”

You might worry the Supreme Court will reverse those Trump-administration losses. It happens, but the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration about 20% of the time. You may have seen headlines like these: “Supreme Court Rejects, for Now, Trump’s Bid to Fire Government Watchdog.” “Amy Coney Barrett, John Roberts Deliver Trump Brutal Loss in NY Appeal.” “Divided Supreme Court rejects Trump bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.”

Even when the Supreme Court does decide in Trump’s favor, along the way, the cases slow down the administration. The delays have led to their own wave of headlines: “Recent court rulings are holding up some of Trump’s highest-profile moves.” “Judges are pausing Trump’s policy changes.” “White House officials bristle as the courts throttle parts of Trump’s agenda.”

Legal suits against the Trump administration are now some of the most powerful tools we have, not just for climate protection, but also for protecting democracy. A bunch of websites now provide lists of who is suing the Trump administration and about what. A review of the suits shows some patterns:

Many of the suits are being brought by state attorneys general. Here in Washington state, Attorney General Nick Brown has led or been part of 40 suits suing the Trump administration. Some cities and counties have joined in, including San Diego; Columbus, Ohio; Madison, Wisconsin; King County; Multnomah County in Oregon, and Oakland County in California.

Many cases against the Trump administration have been brought by unions. If you work where you could be represented by a union, but you haven’t yet joined, now’s the time. This is not just to have representation when negotiating employment contracts. This is also to support our unions as they protect our democracy.

The other organizations that most need your support are nonprofits. Your support can buy more legal help, and the more legal help we have on our side, the better the outcomes.

Here are three nonprofits who deserve support for their defense of the climate: the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and EarthJustice.

Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)

The NRDC has been litigating to protect American natural resources for decades. NRDC reports they sued the first Trump Administration 163 times, winning 90% of their cases. This year, they are suing to:

Stop the Department of Energy from forcing aged gas and coal power plants to continue burning fossil fuels past the shutdown dates that were planned by engineers.

Protect fuel efficiency for gasoline vehicles.

Require the Trump administration comply with congressional budgeting for EV Charging stations (NRDC is partnering on this with the Sierra Club).

Sierra Club

In addition to advocating for our global climate and our environment, the Sierra Club organizes member hiking, biking, skiing, and birding outings. If you love getting into some of the wonderful parks in Washington State, you’ll appreciate meeting folks in the Sierra Club. Locally, the Sno-Isle Sierra Club is partnering with Kicking Gas to make heat pumps affordable for families who want to stop their global warming pollution. Nationally, the Sierra Club is suing the Trump Administration to get them to:

Live up to their legally required financing of new public electric vehicle charging stations

Rehire illegally fired employees for National Parks and National Forests.

Stop the ecological devastation of new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

EarthJustice

With their slogan, “Because the earth needs a good lawyer,” EarthJustice has been suing the government to protect the environment and protect our global climate for 60 years. This year, they are suing the Trump administration to:

Stop illegal defunding of clean energy projects.

Restore the IRA program to help Americans save money on vehicles and appliances that do not create global warming pollution.

Return climate information that farmers depend on to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website.

There are many other organizations that are suing the Trump administration. If I have missed one that you feel is doing particularly good work, let folks know about it in the comments.

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is seeking bids for 500 million units of renewable energy annually to power its operations, aiming to increase clean energy reliance.

In a move aimed at increasing its reliance on clean energy, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has invited bids for the supply of 500 million units of renewable energy annually to power its operations, officials said on Sunday.

According to a statement, the DMRC is seeking to select a 'solar power developer' to set up a grid-connected captive generating plant along with a battery energy storage system (BESS) anywhere in India.

The energy produced will be supplied to the DMRC under a 25-year power purchase agreement, with the project expected to be completed within 15 months of award, it said.

At present, Delhi Metro meets about 33 per cent of its power demand from renewable sources. It procures around 350 MU annually from the Rewa Solar Park in Madhya Pradesh and generates 40 MU from rooftop solar installations across its stations, depots, and residential complexes, the statement said.

During daytime operations, the share of renewable energy reaches nearly 65 per cent, it added.

Live Events

With the new initiative, the DMRC said it aims to increase the share of renewable energy in its total power mix to over 60 per cent, including energy requirements for its upcoming Phase-IV network.

""If achieved, it will become the first Metro system in the country to source more than half of its total energy from clean sources,"" the statement said.

The move is part of DMRC's broader efforts to support India's transition to sustainable and low-carbon urban transport systems and comply with the government's 'Panchamrit' climate action goals announced at COP26.

The Public Utilities Commission last week directed its staff to consider proposals for new energy resources sought by Connecticut.

Any developments will have to be vetted by the commission for their benefits to Maine electric customers.

Connecticut put out a request for proposals last month seeking “late stage” projects that could capture federal tax breaks that may make them more cost-competitive for electric ratepayers.

James Fowler, spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said New England states share an electricity grid and working together on procurements potentially benefits regional ratepayers, enhanced grid reliability and affordability. Each state will perform its own evaluation and make its own decisions on whether to select projects, Fowler added.

“But by sharing information and pooling our demand, we hope to find opportunities to improve project viability and efficiency, such as by enabling purchases at larger scales, and capture the greatest benefits and value for ratepayers,” Fowler added.

In a statement, acting commissioner of the Maine Department of Energy Resources Dan Burgess said the state has often sought opportunities to coordinate with neighboring states on energy initiatives including energy procurement.

“By participating in Connecticut’s latest procurement effort, the state can consider its options to deliver more cost-effective clean power within federal tax credit timelines,” Burgess said.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act curtailed 30% of federal tax credits available to solar and wind developments. Projects now have to start construction by July 2026 or enter service by the end of 2027 and meet other requirements to qualify.

Maine launched its own expedited energy procurement this summer and last month selected five developments for contracts that could provide more than 250 megawatts of electricity.

Over the last fifty years, energy companies have tapped into geothermal sources using machinery to access harder-to-reach reserves.
Geothermal energy contributes just 0.4 percent of the U.S. energy mix, largely due to technological and geographical constraints to accessing geothermal reservoirs.
The firm’s CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli, said, “Geothermal power is one of several renewable energy sources expanding globally and proving to be a vital contributor to advancing sustainable energy development.
Investments in innovative geothermal extraction technologies show great promise for the commercial rollout of new operations across the country.","One of the few renewable energy sources that the Trump administration has not yet criticised is geothermal power, as companies across the United States continue to develop innovative geothermal projects with financial support from Biden-era policies. The sweeping budget legislation that President Trump signed in July preserved most key tax credits for geothermal power. Bipartisan support has encouraged several energy companies and startups to invest heavily in research and development into advanced geothermal operations in recent years, with promising results, giving hope for future clean energy production.

People have been tapping into geothermal energy from natural heat sources worldwide for centuries. Over the last fifty years, energy companies have tapped into geothermal sources using machinery to access harder-to-reach reserves. To achieve this, companies drill a borehole up to several kilometres deep, where the rocks are around 200°C, and inject water and sand at high pressure. This creates fractures in the rocks, which increases their permeability and produces a reservoir of hot water that can be extracted via a second borehole for the water to be used to generate electricity.

Geothermal energy contributes just 0.4 percent of the U.S. energy mix, largely due to technological and geographical constraints to accessing geothermal reservoirs. Existing plants depend on naturally occurring reservoirs of hot water and steam, in regions such as Northern California and Nevada, to power turbines and generate power. However, companies are now exploring new ways to access geothermal resources using techniques developed for oil fracking and innovative new methods to reach harder-to-access reservoirs in unconventional regions.

Sage Geothermal is now using heat and pressure to generate more power than conventional extraction methods through its cycle-based heat recovery approach. The company’s CEO, Cindy Taff, told Forbes, “By using the natural elasticity of the rock, we can bring hot water to the surface without pumps. Unlike traditional approaches, we maintain pressure in the system rather than venting it at the surface, and we hold open fractures with pressure instead of adding bridging materials like sand or proppant. These innovations reduce friction and energy losses, boosting net power output by 25 to 50 percent compared to other next-generation geothermal technologies.”

In August, Sage announced it was partnering with the international geothermal energy developer Ormat Technologies to roll out its next-generation technology at an Ormat facility in either Nevada or Utah. This is expected to help Sage speed up the development of its first commercial power-generation facility by around two years. Taff said, “For us, the ability to scale faster with Ormat is huge… But it’s also a great opportunity for Ormat to reach a deeper [geothermal] resource than what they’re targeting now.”

In September, Sage signed an agreement with the geothermal startup Fervo Energy to advance their geothermal activities. The two companies have both invested heavily in research and development into alternative geothermal extraction methods and could work together to advance this work. Fervo recently signed a deal with tech giant Google to provide it with clean power, while Sage has completed an agreement with Meta.

Houston-headquartered Fervo Energy was approved to deploy 2 GW of geothermal power in Beaver County, Utah, by the Department of the Interior last year, with its facility set to begin generating power in 2026. The company uses an Enhanced Geothermal Systems (ESG) proprietary technology to drill horizontally into geothermal reservoirs, allowing it to access multiple wells from a single location and showing promise for greater unconventional geothermal energy generation.

In September, the energy technology company Baker Hughes was contracted by Fervo Energy to supply equipment for five of its power plants in the Cape Station project in Utah. The plants are expected to produce 300 MW of electricity once fully operational, enough to power about 180,000 homes. Baker Hughes will supply engineering and manufacturing equipment as well as turboexpanders and the BRUSH Power Generation generator.

The firm’s CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli, said, “Geothermal power is one of several renewable energy sources expanding globally and proving to be a vital contributor to advancing sustainable energy development. “By working with a leader like Fervo Energy and leveraging our comprehensive portfolio of technology solutions, we are supporting the scaling of lower-carbon power solutions that are integral to meet growing global energy demand.”

In September, Bill Gates visited Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project alongside Senator John Curtis. He described the company’s horizontal drilling method as a “truly innovative approach” and discussed the role companies like Fervo will play in maintaining America’s energy independence. The founder of tech giant Microsoft said, “Geothermal is one of the most promising ways to deliver clean energy that’s reliable and affordable.”

As the outlook for renewable energy in the United States becomes more uncertain, following the Trump administration's attacks on solar and wind power, the geothermal energy sector appears to have maintained the backing of the government as several companies continue to expand operations. Investments in innovative geothermal extraction technologies show great promise for the commercial rollout of new operations across the country.

This proposed facility was set to provide 6.2 gigawatts of clean energy from a vast area in the Nevada desert. However, it has disappeared from the Bureau of Land Management’s list of active projects, illustrating a shift away from renewable energy developments.

Esmeralda 7 Overview

Esmeralda 7 was intended to cover a land area comparable to Las Vegas. Once operational, it could have powered millions of homes while stabilizing energy costs for Nevada. The project was backed by industry giants such as NextEra, Invenergy, and Arevia, which were ready to invest billions of dollars.

Policy Changes and Their Implications

The cancellation resulted from changes made by the Interior Department under Secretary Doug Burgum. A new set of rules was introduced that complicates the approval process for renewable projects. As a result, large-scale developments like Esmeralda 7 face increased regulatory burdens, fragmented reviews, and heightened scrutiny.

Withdrawal of Programmatic Review: The review process that allowed for streamlined permits was rescinded.

Increased Barriers: New strategies limit acreage for solar developments and raise leasing costs.

Impact on Project Economics: Each subproject now requires separate environmental studies, undermining economic viability.

Consequences for Nevada

NV Energy forecasts a dramatic rise in electricity consumption due to data centers, expecting a 373% increase by 2030. Instead of relying on affordable clean energy from Esmeralda 7, the state will likely resort to gas-fired generation and higher electricity bills.

The Larger Context of Energy Production

While the U.S. turns away from large clean energy projects, countries like China and India are rapidly increasing their renewable capacities. This shift creates a competitive disadvantage for American industries that depend on affordable energy. The global emphasis is on reducing costs and promoting efficiency while the U.S. revisits outdated growth models.

International Success Models: Projects in Egypt, India, and Australia demonstrate the effectiveness of coordinated renewable development.

Cost Comparisons: Utility-scale solar averages $30 to $45 per MWh, making it highly competitive against fossil fuels.

The Future of Energy in America

The cancellation of Esmeralda 7 reflects a broader trend towards regulatory obstacles that threaten energy affordability. As the U.S. government complicates the deployment of renewable energy, the nation may find itself lagging in the global energy race. Investing in clean energy is not just an environmental imperative; it is also a crucial economic strategy.

In conclusion, the lack of initiative surrounding U.S. energy policies underscores the need for renewed commitment to clean, affordable energy projects.

The new Model 3 rides smoother than before, with revised suspension tuning that soaks up road imperfections without feeling detached.
Unlike many competitors, Tesla’s range estimates tend to hold up under real-world driving conditions—a result of optimized software, efficient motors, and aerodynamic design.
Tesla’s Supercharger network, now opening to non-Tesla vehicles in several states, still offers the fastest and most widespread fast-charging experience in North America.
The Model 3 Standard supports up to 170 kW DC fast charging, allowing an 80% top-up in just over 25 minutes under optimal conditions.","In the nearly two decades since Tesla rolled its first all-electric roadster onto California streets, the company has worn many hats: tech disruptor, Wall Street darling, cultural lightning rod. But the 2026 Model 3 Standard may signal something simpler—and perhaps more consequential. It’s Tesla getting back to basics.

The new Model 3 isn’t flashy. It doesn’t tout record-breaking speed or breakthrough battery chemistry. Instead, it refines what already worked: a sedan that looks sleek, drives clean, and now, quietly undercuts much of the electric competition on price. With modest design updates, an improved ride, and an estimated range north of 320 miles (514.99 km), this version appears built less to dazzle than to dominate.

Tesla has trimmed weight, streamlined components, and recalibrated its pricing in an electric vehicle market that’s cooling from the highs of 2021. According to data from Cox Automotive, EV inventory in the U.S. reached an all-time high this summer, while average EV prices dropped nearly 20% from a year prior. In that landscape, the Model 3 Standard’s quiet arrival feels almost subversive.

There’s no viral unveiling or theatrical reveal. Just a tighter build, a quieter cabin, and fewer dollars on the sticker. It may not be the most exciting Tesla release—but it could be the most important one in years.

Design Language Grows Up, Subtly

The visual changes are subtle enough to miss at a glance, but side by side with the outgoing model, the new Model 3 is unmistakably sharper. Headlights are narrower. The front fascia is cleaner. The hoodline, marginally lowered, adds a more assertive stance. Tesla claims improved aerodynamics, and while the drag coefficient is only slightly reduced, the cumulative effect is noticeable in real-world driving—less wind noise, better efficiency.

Inside, the theme is restraint. Physical buttons are gone entirely, replaced by capacitive controls and voice activation. A single touchscreen remains the command center for everything from navigation to climate. While some drivers may miss tactile inputs, Tesla’s user interface has matured significantly, and software updates have made features like lane keeping and adaptive cruise smoother and more intuitive than earlier iterations.

The result isn’t a revolution. It’s refinement. This is a car that feels familiar—but finished.

Performance That Prioritizes Polish Over Power

In a lineup known for zero-to-sixty bravado, the Standard’s single-motor, rear-wheel-drive configuration is refreshingly grounded. Acceleration is brisk but not blistering—Tesla hasn’t released final specs, but independent testing from AutoGuide pegs the sprint to 60 mph (96.56 km/h) around 5.8 seconds, squarely in the range of a BMW 3 Series or Audi A4.

What stands out more is the chassis. The new Model 3 rides smoother than before, with revised suspension tuning that soaks up road imperfections without feeling detached. Steering remains light but responsive, and regenerative braking has been refined for more predictable pedal feel.

Tesla has also expanded driver control over performance settings. Drivers can now tweak regenerative braking intensity, cooling modes, and even traction bias, giving more customization than previous Standard trims. These are small additions, but they signal Tesla’s intent to treat even its base models with engineering care.

Range Estimates That Meet Real-World Expectations

Tesla claims an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, placing the Standard version well above the median for similarly priced EVs. Unlike many competitors, Tesla’s range estimates tend to hold up under real-world driving conditions—a result of optimized software, efficient motors, and aerodynamic design.

Battery size remains slightly below that of the Long Range or Performance models, but advances in energy density and drivetrain management help close the gap. The company has also improved thermal management systems to maintain range stability across climates—a common pain point for EV drivers in colder regions from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Charging remains a strong suit. Tesla’s Supercharger network, now opening to non-Tesla vehicles in several states, still offers the fastest and most widespread fast-charging experience in North America. The Model 3 Standard supports up to 170 kW DC fast charging, allowing an 80% top-up in just over 25 minutes under optimal conditions.

The Affordability Pivot Is No Accident

The most attention-grabbing change is the one on the invoice. The 2026 Model 3 Standard now starts below $38,000 before federal incentives, making it eligible for up to $7,500 in EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act—assuming final battery sourcing meets eligibility rules source. That could bring the effective price below $31,000, rivaling many gas-powered sedans.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-Model-3-Standard-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:01:25.058642

Critical minerals represent essential non-fuel materials with high supply disruption risk that serve as the building blocks for modern defense technologies, renewable energy systems, and advanced manufacturing. The Pentagon has launched an unprecedented $1 billion procurement initiative to secure these resources amid growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and national security risks.

These minerals—including rare earth elements, battery metals, and specialized alloys—form the foundation of modern military equipment, from precision-guided weapons to communications systems. Without secure access to these resources, America's defense capabilities and technological edge could be seriously compromised.

The U.S. Geological Survey currently identifies 50 mineral commodities as critical minerals energy security based on their economic and national security importance coupled with supply chain vulnerability. This designation follows strict criteria established under the Energy Act of 2020, evaluating factors like importance to key sectors and potential for supply disruptions.

Key Characteristics of Strategic Defense Critical Minerals

High importance to national security: Essential components in weapons systems, communications equipment, and military vehicles

Significant supply chain vulnerabilities: Often concentrated in geopolitically sensitive regions

Limited domestic production: Many critical minerals have minimal or non-existent U.S. production capacity

Foreign processing domination: While raw materials may exist globally, processing capacity is often concentrated in specific countries

Irreplaceability: Many critical minerals have unique properties that cannot be easily substituted

Defense applications for these minerals are extensive and growing. For example, each Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bomb requires approximately 0.5-1 kg of rare earth materials, while a single F-35 fighter jet contains approximately 920 pounds of rare earth elements across various systems.

How Is the Pentagon Addressing Critical Mineral Supply Vulnerabilities?

The Strategic Procurement Initiative

The Department of Defense has allocated significant resources toward purchasing and stockpiling critical minerals—representing the largest such investment in decades. This strategic buying initiative marks a fundamental shift in defense resource management, moving from just-in-time acquisition toward building resilient strategic reserves.

The initiative encompasses multiple approaches:

Direct purchases of processed critical minerals from domestic and allied sources

Strategic investments in revitalizing domestic mining and processing capacity

Long-term off-take agreements with U.S. producers to guarantee markets

Development of alternative supply chains through international partnerships

The Defense Production Act Title III program, which provides the Pentagon authority to strengthen domestic industrial base capabilities, has allocated over $500 million for critical materials initiatives since 2020 alone, according to the Department of Defense Office of Industrial Policy.

Strategic Investments in Domestic Production

Rather than simply purchasing minerals on the open market, the Pentagon has made targeted investments to rebuild domestic supply chains. Notable examples include:

Investment Type Recipient Purpose Defense Production Act Funding MP Materials Support rare earth mining and processing capacity Defense Production Act Funding USA Rare Earth Develop separation technology for heavy rare earths Contract Award Lynas USA Build commercial heavy rare earth separation facility

In March 2022, the Department of Defense announced a $35 million Defense Production Act investment to support MP Materials in developing rare earth processing capabilities at its Mountain Pass facility in California. This represents part of a broader strategy to reestablish domestic processing capabilities that have significantly declined over past decades.

Which Critical Minerals Are Prioritized for the National Defense Stockpile?

High-Priority Rare Earth Elements

Rare earth elements top the Pentagon's priority list due to their irreplaceable role in defense technologies and the near-complete dominance of processing by foreign entities.

Key rare earth targets include:

Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr) Oxide: Essential for powerful permanent magnets used in precision weapons, electric vehicle motors, and wind turbines. These magnets can achieve magnetic field strengths of 1.3-1.5 Tesla, enabling significant miniaturization of motors and actuators in guided missile systems.

Dysprosium: Critical for enhancing coercivity of NdFeB magnets at high operating temperatures (exceeding 200°C), making it essential for military systems operating in extreme environments.

Samarium: Used in specialized samarium-cobalt magnets for missile guidance systems. These magnets are preferred for precision-guided munitions due to their superior temperature stability, with operating ranges from -40°C to 350°C.

Terbium: Essential for sonar systems, fuel cells, and various electronic warfare applications.

Battery Metals and Other Critical Materials

Beyond rare earths, the stockpiling initiative targets several other critical materials:

Cobalt: Essential for high-performance batteries and aerospace alloys. The Defense Logistics Agency's 2024 assessment identifies cobalt as a ""Tier 1"" critical material.

Manganese: Critical for steel production and battery cathodes, with limited domestic production capacity.

Lithium: Fundamental to advanced battery systems for portable military equipment and increasingly for electrified tactical vehicles.

Graphite: Required for battery anodes and various defense applications, with no domestic production currently at commercial scale.

Gallium: Used in radar systems, advanced electronics, and semiconductor applications critical for defense technologies.

What Challenges Does the U.S. Face in Securing Critical Mineral Supplies?

Foreign Dependency Concerns

The United States currently depends heavily on imports for many critical minerals, with China controlling processing for approximately 80-90% of rare earths globally. This dependency creates significant national security vulnerabilities, especially as geopolitical tensions rise.

According to U.S. Geological Survey data, the United States is 100% import-reliant for 12 critical minerals and more than 50% import-reliant for an additional 31 minerals. This heavy dependence on foreign sources—many concentrated in regions of geopolitical concern—creates strategic vulnerabilities for the defense industrial base.

Limited Domestic Processing Capacity

While the U.S. possesses significant mineral reserves, decades of underinvestment have left domestic processing capabilities severely limited. Rebuilding this infrastructure requires substantial capital investment and time.

Key challenges include:

New processing facilities typically require 7-10 years to develop fully from initial planning to commercial operation

Environmental permitting creates additional hurdles, with U.S. processes taking 2-3 times longer than in competing countries

Technical expertise has diminished with offshoring of processing capacity

Initial capital requirements of $150-300 million for commercially viable rare earth separation facilities

Market Concentration and Price Volatility

Critical mineral markets are often characterized by:

High concentration of production in a few countries, limiting competition

Susceptibility to market manipulation by dominant producers

Extreme price volatility that discourages private investment

Limited transparency in pricing and contracts

Price volatility poses a particular challenge to investment stability. For example, NdPr oxide prices have fluctuated dramatically—from $40/kg in 2019 to $165/kg in 2022, then back down to $62/kg in 2024—representing 400% variation within just five years. This volatility makes long-term planning exceedingly difficult without government support.

How Does the National Defense Stockpile Currently Operate?

Current Stockpile Status and Limitations

The National Defense Stockpile was established during the Cold War but has been significantly depleted over decades. Current reserves are insufficient for modern defense needs.

Key stockpile metrics:

Present stockpile value: Approximately $888.9 million as of September 30, 2023

Authorized holding capacity: $3.4 billion worth of critical materials

Coverage: Only weeks to months of critical materials for defense needs

Focus: Emergency defense requirements, not broader industrial resilience

Management: Defense Logistics Agency's Strategic Materials office

The current stockpile contains 42 different materials deemed critical for defense applications, with primary holdings including cobalt, beryllium, chromium, manganese, and various rare earth compounds. However, this represents a small fraction of the stockpile's historical peak.

At its Cold War peak in 1954, the National Defense Stockpile held the equivalent of $43.2 billion (inflation-adjusted to 2023 dollars) in strategic materials. Systematic disposal programs reduced holdings by over 90% between 1990-2020, leaving the current pentagon critical minerals stockpile at historically low levels relative to defense needs.

Modernization Efforts

The current stockpiling initiative represents a fundamental reimagining of the stockpile's purpose and scope:

Expanding beyond traditional war reserve materials to support technological innovation

Incorporating a broader range of technologies and applications, especially electronics and energy storage

Supporting domestic production capacity rather than just warehousing materials

Developing more sophisticated management approaches that account for technological change

The National Defense Stockpile operates under a multi-stage requirement determination process:

Needs analysis conducted by the Defense Logistics Agency every three years

Requirements calculation based on a three-year wartime scenario

Acquisition planning authorized by the annual National Defense Authorization Act

Market approach using competitive bidding when possible and negotiated contracts for specialized materials

What Legislative Support Exists for Critical Mineral Security?

Recent Legislative Actions

Several recent legislative initiatives have strengthened the legal framework for critical mineral security:

Defense Production Act: Provides authority for investments in critical mineral production capacity, with expanded use since 2020

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021): Allocated $140 million for critical minerals mapping, data collection, and research through USGS programs

CHIPS and Science Act (2022): Includes $500 million for critical minerals research and processing technology development through the Department of Energy

Inflation Reduction Act (2022): Establishes domestic content requirements for critical minerals in electric vehicle batteries to qualify for tax credits: 40% (2023), increasing to 80% by 2027

Annual Defense Authorization Acts: Regularly include provisions for critical mineral security

These legislative actions reflect growing bipartisan consensus on the importance of addressing critical mineral supply vulnerabilities.

Evolving Policy Framework

The U.S. government has developed increasingly sophisticated approaches to critical mineral security:

Creation of more targeted ""strategic defense critical minerals"" lists that prioritize the most vulnerable materials

Improved interagency coordination on mineral security issues through formal working groups

Development of whole-of-government approaches to supply chain resilience

International partnerships with allied nations to diversify supply sources

Integration of critical minerals into broader industrial policy frameworks

Congressional appropriations for Defense Production Act Title III critical minerals funding have increased from approximately $25 million in FY2019 to $250 million in FY2024, representing a ten-fold increase in just five years. This dramatic funding growth reflects the escalating priority placed on mineral security issues.

How Are Public-Private Partnerships Advancing Mineral Security?

Case Study: Domestic Processing Partnerships

The Pentagon's partnerships with domestic producers exemplify the new approach to critical mineral security. For example:

Initial Investment: The Department of Defense announced a $35 million Defense Production Act investment in MP Materials in March 2022

Private Sector Commitment: MP Materials committed to investing in expansion of domestic rare earth processing capacity at its Mountain Pass facility

Supply Chain Development: Creation of a vertically integrated supply chain from mining through magnet manufacturing

Technology Development: Joint research into processing improvements and efficiency gains

Workforce Development: Training programs for specialized skills in mineral processing

Similarly, in May 2021, the Department of Defense awarded Lynas USA $30.4 million to build a commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in Texas, focused on processing dysprosium and terbium for defense applications.

Broader Industry Engagement

Beyond individual partnerships, the Pentagon is engaging with industry through:

Industry consortia for technology development and standard-setting

Supply chain mapping exercises to identify vulnerabilities

Standards development for critical materials to ensure compatibility

Information sharing on emerging risks and opportunities

Research and development partnerships through defense laboratories

These collaborative approaches represent a significant evolution from traditional defense procurement models, recognizing that addressing mineral security requires sustained cooperation between government and private industry.

What Role Do International Alliances Play in Critical Mineral Security?

Partnerships with Allied Nations

The U.S. is developing coordinated approaches with allies to reduce collective vulnerability:

Minerals Security Partnership (MSP): Launched in June 2022 at the G7 Summit with 11 member countries (United States, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, Sweden, United Kingdom, Norway) plus the European Union as an institutional partner

U.S.-Australia Critical Minerals Compact: Signed in October 2023 with a $140 million combined investment commitment in Australia's strategic reserve and battery minerals projects

U.S.-Canada Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals: Identifies 31 critical minerals of mutual interest with commitments to regulatory cooperation on permitting, joint R&D on processing technologies, and information sharing on supply security

Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group: Established in 2021 between US, Australia, India, and Japan with critical minerals security as a core focus

These international frameworks aim to create alternative supply chains that reduce collective dependence on potentially unreliable sources.

Diversification Strategies

These international partnerships pursue several key objectives:

Developing alternative supply sources outside regions of concern

Coordinating stockpiling efforts to prevent market disruption from government purchases

Sharing technology for more efficient extraction and processing

Establishing common standards and practices for responsible sourcing

Pooling research and development resources

The Minerals Security Partnership represents the most comprehensive international framework, bringing together major democratic economies to accelerate the development of diverse critical mineral supply chains through coordinated action and investment.

What Future Developments Are Expected in Critical Mineral Security?

Emerging Technologies and Approaches

The critical minerals landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with several emerging trends:

Urban Mining: Recovering critical minerals from electronic waste and industrial byproducts. According to the UN Global E-waste Monitor 2024, an estimated 62 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated globally in 2022, containing approximately 50,000 metric tons of rare earth elements, 320,000 metric tons of copper, and 16,000 metric tons of cobalt—with less than 20% currently recovered.

Deep Sea Mining: Exploring ocean floor resources, though with significant environmental concerns that require careful assessment and mitigation strategies.

Advanced Recycling: Developing more efficient processes for recovering minerals from end-of-life products. The U.S. Department of Energy's Critical Materials Institute projects that advanced recycling technologies could supply 30-40% of U.S. rare earth demand by 2035.

Material Substitution: Researching alternatives to reduce dependency on the most vulnerable minerals, including development of reduced-dysprosium magnet formulations.

Long-Term Strategic Planning

The Pentagon is developing more sophisticated approaches to long-term mineral security:

20-year strategic plans for critical mineral security that account for technological change

Integration of mineral security into broader defense industrial base planning

Development of early warning systems for emerging supply risks

Regular reassessment of critical mineral priorities as technologies evolve

Coordinated public-private investment strategies that balance security with economic efficiency

These forward-looking approaches reflect growing recognition that mineral security requires sustained, multi-decade commitment rather than short-term fixes.

How Can the U.S. Achieve Greater Critical Mineral Independence?

Multi-Faceted Approach

Achieving greater independence requires a coordinated strategy across multiple domains:

Domestic Production: Revitalizing mining and processing within the U.S., focusing on highest-priority materials

Recycling and Recovery: Developing circular economy approaches to recover materials from waste streams

Substitution Research: Finding alternatives to the most vulnerable materials through materials science

Stockpiling: Maintaining strategic reserves for emergency needs and market stabilization

International Partnerships: Coordinating with allies on shared challenges and complementary capabilities

This comprehensive approach recognizes that no single strategy can address all vulnerabilities, requiring parallel efforts across multiple domains.

Balancing Competing Priorities

Successful critical mineral security requires balancing multiple considerations:

Economic efficiency versus supply security in sourcing decisions

Environmental protection versus resource development in permitting processes

Short-term costs versus long-term resilience in investment decisions

Domestic production versus international partnerships in supply chain design

Commercial applications versus defense requirements in technology development

Finding the right balance between these competing priorities requires thoughtful policy coordination and private-public cooperation. Furthermore, Trump's critical minerals order and the ongoing development of a European CRM facility demonstrate how this has become a global concern requiring international solutions.

FAQ: Pentagon Critical Minerals Stockpile

What exactly is the National Defense Stockpile?

The National Defense Stockpile is a reserve of strategic and critical materials maintained by the U.S. government to prevent dangerous and costly dependence on foreign sources during national emergencies. Currently valued at approximately $888.9 million, it includes various metals, minerals, and materials deemed essential for defense applications. The stockpile is managed by the Defense Logistics Agency Strategic Materials office and operates under authorities established in the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act.

Why is the Pentagon investing in rare earth elements specifically?

Rare earth elements are irreplaceable in many advanced defense technologies, including precision-guided weapons, night vision equipment, and communications systems. Currently, China dominates global processing capacity for these materials at 85-90%, creating significant vulnerability for U.S. defense capabilities. Additionally, many rare earth applications require very specific properties that cannot be achieved with substitute materials, making them particularly critical for national security.

How does the current stockpiling initiative differ from previous approaches?

The current initiative represents a fundamental shift from passive warehousing to active supply chain development. Rather than simply purchasing and storing materials, the Pentagon is investing in domestic production capacity, developing public-private partnerships, and creating guaranteed markets for U.S. producers. This approach addresses the underlying structural weaknesses in critical mineral supply chains rather than merely creating temporary buffers against disruption.

Will these investments affect consumer technology prices?

While the primary focus is national security, increased domestic production of critical minerals may eventually help stabilize prices for consumer technologies that use these same materials, including electric vehicles, smartphones, and renewable energy systems. However, the immediate impact on consumer prices is likely to be minimal. Over the longer term, more diverse and resilient supply chains should reduce price volatility, potentially benefiting both defense and civilian applications.

How long will it take to develop domestic alternatives to foreign supplies?

Developing robust domestic supply chains for critical minerals typically requires 7-10 years from initial investment to full-scale production. The Pentagon's current investments represent early steps in what will necessarily be a long-term process of rebuilding domestic capabilities. Environmental permitting, technology development, facility construction, and workforce training all require significant time. While initial results may be seen within 3-5 years for some materials, comprehensive supply chain resilience is a decade-long endeavor.

The company has begun telling tired drivers to switch on its Full Self-Driving system. Safety researchers say this move might backfire and have severe consequences, Wired reported.

What's happening?

Tesla's dashboard prompts drivers to consider activating FSD, the brand's most advanced driver-assist package, if they feel drowsy. However, the feature is still considered experimental and requires constant human oversight.

That's where the concern comes in. For so long, the feature held a disclaimer that the driver must be able to take control at any given time. With the new in-car messaging in place, researchers worry that it could confuse tired drivers when they need to be focused on the road.

""The prompt seems highly contrary to research,"" Bryan Reimer, a driver assistance technology research scientist at MIT's AgeLab, pointed out to Wired.

Why is this important?

""As humans, as we get tired or we get fatigued, taking away more things that we need to do could actually backfire,"" Charlie Klauer, a driver and driving performance researcher at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, explained to Wired. He noted that implementing such a system could be tricky.

According to the National Sleep Foundation, 20% of driving accidents in 2023 were caused by drowsy driving. Suggesting tired drivers hand over more control could increase risks instead of reducing them.

The environmental angle also matters. Electric vehicles are supposed to help reduce heat-trapping pollution and save money on transportation. If drivers and regulators lose trust in EVs because of safety controversies, adoption could slow down.

Critics also argue that the alert could mislead users into believing FSD is closer to full autonomy than it really is.

Tesla has previously faced scrutiny for allegedly overstating its software's abilities, and its other features — like the force-touch turn signals in Model 3 and Model S vehicles — have sparked controversy in driving schools. Safety advocates worry this move undermines the company's claims of prioritizing driver responsibility.

What's being done about it?

Advocates are calling for clearer rules on semi-autonomous features, as highlighted in the Indiana Law Journal, and for tighter regulations, according to research published in Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives.

China is courting leaders around the world who have been stung by the Trump tariffs.","“I love tariffs,” President Trump has said. “My favorite word is ‘tariff.’”

Thanks to the tariffs he has imposed on about 90 countries, he claims, “we’re becoming rich as hell. … And when we finish this out, there’ll never be any wealth like what we have.” The United States has “already solved inflation, we’ve solved prices,” Trump maintains as well.

A substantial majority of Americans do not agree.

In a poll taken in August by the Pew Research Center, 61 percent of respondents did not approve of Trump’s tariff policies. And 55 percent indicated the levies will have a negative impact on them, their families and the country.

Americans have good reason to be concerned. Far from becoming “rich as hell,” the federal government is in a deep financial hole. This year, spending increased by $391 billion; the $1.9 trillion deficit is the third largest in U.S. history. The total national debt tops $37 trillion, a number which, following passage of the administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” is virtually certain to increase by trillions. Tariff revenues have not and cannot make more than a small dent in these deficits.

At 17.4 percent, the Trump tariff rate is at its highest since 1935. Tariffs are the principal reason inflation is higher now than it was when Trump began his second term in January. This year, tariffs will, on average, cost each household about $2,300. Price increases include a 10 percent levy on wood and lumber and 25 percent on kitchen cabinets, upholstered furniture and bathroom vanities, set to go into effect on Oct. 14. The added costs are likely to slow the construction of affordable residential housing, which is already out of reach for many buyers and renters.

The tariffs have upended supply chains. Apple has moved iPhone assembly plants from China to India. Stellantis N.V. paused production in North America because of price hikes in automotive components. To evade tariffs, China has moved some manufacturing and assembly operations to other countries.

Applied to friends as well as foes, at times without a discernible justification or, as with Brazil, out of personal or partisan animus, the tariffs have antagonized Canadians, Mexicans, Japanese, Australians and members of the European Union. China is courting leaders around the world who have been stung by the Trump tariffs.

Ironically, the tariff war has also undermined the domestic manufacturing and agrarian sectors of the economy Trump promised to protect and promote.

China’s zeroing out of its multibillion-dollar purchases of American soybeans, the largest agricultural product exported by the United States, caused prices to plummet to $9 per bushel. John Deere & Company attributes much of its projected 26 percent drop in net income to reduced spending by farmers on machinery and price increases in aluminum and steel. Trucking companies have suffered as well from the decline in agricultural exports.

“Farmers … are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit,” Trump has declared. And so, the administration, which distributed $23 billion to them during the trade wars in his first term, is now preparing a bailout in the neighborhood of $35-50 billion.

Already reeling from higher prices for fertilizers and equipment and the potentially permanent loss of markets, farmers are apoplectic about reports that the administration is working out details of a $20 billion aid package to Argentina, which comes on the heels of that country’s replacement of the United States as the major supplier of soybeans to China. Scarcely part of an America First agenda, what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent calls a “credit swap line,” appears to be a lifeline to Argentina’s embattled libertarian president, Javier Milei, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.

The CEOs of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis NV recently projected that tariffs will cost their companies $4.5 billion, $2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in revenues, and that production levels would not rebound until 2027. In an apparent attempt to placate them and prevent potential buyers of cars and trucks from sticker shock, the Trump administration is reportedly close to a deal that would spare vehicles assembled in the U.S. from tariffs.

This move was an about-face by a president who imposed an import tax on Mexican vehicles in July 2025 that exceeded the rate on all other countries except China, undermining the USMCA treaty he had signed with Mexico and Canada in 2020 and praised as “the largest fairest, most balanced and modern trade agreement ever achieved.”

Whether Trump has the authority to, in essence, take over tariff policy is in dispute. The Constitution grants Congress the power to impose tariffs. Legislation in the 20th century allowed the president to levy tariffs to address threats to national security and unfair trade practices, but the Supreme Court has indicated that this delegation of powers must include “intelligible principles” that limit the president’s actions.

The Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on tariffs in the coming months. Whatever the high court decides, however, it should be clear that using tariffs as a blunt instrument of global domination actually does substantial damage to America’s international reputation, national interests and economy, as well as to its manufacturers, retailers and consumers.

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a477104a-9966-40c9-b597-1af6563b709f/wirestory_a5c28123e10a0090896e59abf69c152c_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-12 08:59:42.937158

Researchers have now developed a cocatalyst that introduces single-atom copper sites into tungsten nitride, creating highly active centers that favor hydrogen generation over unwanted byproducts. When combined with a cadmium sulfide photocatalyst, the new system achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 172.69 μmol·h⁻¹ with selectivity approaching 95%. Detailed experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that copper single atoms enhance charge transfer, open electron pathways, and provide novel active sites for hydrogen evolution. This discovery demonstrates a powerful strategy for designing efficient and selective photocatalytic systems for renewable hydrogen production.

Hydrogen is considered a clean fuel for the future, but conventional production methods remain energy-intensive and carbon-emitting. Photoreforming of formic acid, a common biomass derivative and hydrogen carrier, provides a mild and renewable pathway for hydrogen generation. However, traditional semiconductor catalysts such as CdS suffer from low activity and poor selectivity due to competing side reactions, including carbon monoxide formation, which reduce hydrogen purity. Transition-metal nitrides have recently emerged as cocatalysts with improved performance, yet selectivity limitations persist. Based on these challenges, there is a critical need to develop advanced catalysts with engineered active sites to enhance both efficiency and selectivity in hydrogen photoreforming systems.

A research team from Xi’an Jiaotong University, University of South China, and collaborating institutes reported a development (DOI: 10.1002/cey2.70024) in Carbon Energy on June 4, 2025. The study presents a Cu–W₂N₃ cocatalyst containing atomically dispersed copper sites, which, when integrated with CdS, markedly enhances hydrogen production from the photoreforming of formic acid. The new system achieved higher activity and nearly 95% hydrogen selectivity, outperforming conventional cocatalysts. This work sheds light on how tailoring single-atom sites on cocatalyst surfaces can effectively direct reaction pathways toward clean hydrogen generation.

The team synthesized two-dimensional Cu–W₂N₃ nanosheets using a modified molten salt method, ensuring the copper species were atomically dispersed rather than aggregated into nanoparticles. Advanced microscopy and spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Cu single-atom sites with a +1 oxidation state embedded in the W₂N₃ lattice. These sites altered the electronic structure, creating Cu–N–W electron channels that facilitated rapid charge transfer from CdS to the cocatalyst. Performance tests showed that the CdS/Cu–W₂N₃ hybrid achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 172.69 μmol·h⁻¹ with selectivity up to 93.7–95%, significantly higher than bare CdS (45%) or CdS/W₂N₃ (83%). The system also demonstrated excellent stability across ten continuous cycles. Mechanistic studies revealed that copper single atoms suppress carbon monoxide evolution by reducing nitrogen vacancy sites while simultaneously providing efficient new active centers for hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory calculations further supported that Cu single atoms on the {001} facet are energetically favorable for hydrogen formation. Together, these findings confirm that rational design of single-atom cocatalysts is a powerful strategy to simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity in solar-driven hydrogen production.

“Our study shows that introducing single-atom copper sites into tungsten nitride fundamentally changes the selectivity of photocatalytic reactions,” said Prof. Xiangjiu Guan, corresponding author. “These atomically dispersed sites not only accelerate electron transfer but also suppress competing pathways that produce carbon monoxide. This dual function allows us to obtain hydrogen with very high purity under sunlight. The work highlights how careful engineering of cocatalyst surfaces at the atomic level can unlock new opportunities for efficient, sustainable hydrogen production from renewable resources.”

The development of Cu–W₂N₃ single-atom cocatalysts opens a new pathway toward practical solar-driven hydrogen production. By ensuring high selectivity and stability, the system addresses two major barriers to scaling photocatalytic hydrogen technologies. Beyond formic acid, the design principles could be applied to other biomass-derived fuels and liquid hydrogen carriers, offering a sustainable route for coupling carbon-neutral energy conversion with biomass utilization. The study also advances the broader field of single-atom catalysis, showing how atomic precision can control reaction outcomes. Ultimately, this approach paves the way for producing high-purity hydrogen as a clean fuel for transportation, storage, and chemical industries.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he’s enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that’s set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-899.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 11:00:53.771159

NuScale Power is looking to build smaller, modular nuclear reactors.

Unlike traditional site-built reactors, these reactors can be made in a factory.

NuScale is at the leading edge of a big change in nuclear power.

10 stocks we like better than NuScale Power ›

If you hear the names Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, you will most likely associate them with nuclear power. But not in a good way, since the notoriety of these names is because of nuclear meltdowns, or near misses.

NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) is hoping it can change the nuclear power industry for the better by changing the way power plants are built. Not enough people are talking about this company or the nuclear technology change that it is helping develop.

The ""big"" problem with nuclear power

Historically, nuclear power plants have been huge capital investment projects. Nuclear reactors have, so far, been site built, meaning that all of the construction basically takes place where the reactor is going to be located. The projects have also been massive, with nuclear power plants often meant to replace large coal or natural gas power plants.

It isn't uncommon for nuclear reactor projects to be delayed and over budget. For example, the most recent nuclear power plant built in the United States, by regulated utility The Southern Company, was seven years late and cost around $17 billion more than expected. Those are not good construction results, even though Southern will now have access to reliable nuclear power for decades into the future.

Given that backdrop, it is understandable that another company building the same style of nuclear power plant at roughly the same time simply gave up when its project manager, Westinghouse, went bankrupt. Southern, by contrast, took on the role of project manager from Westinghouse, which was also overseeing its reactors, so it could keep its power plant construction going.

Needless to say, the nuclear power industry isn't an easy industry in which to operate. And when things go wrong at a large, site-built nuclear power plant, they can go wrong in a massive way, noting the two meltdowns and one near miss highlighted above. That usually earns the entire industry a black eye despite a generally safe operating history for most nuclear power plants.

NuScale is changing the script by going ""small""

This is where NuScale Power comes in, given that it is building small scale modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). These reactors are built in a factory, creating a more uniform product that also benefits from the cost efficiencies offered by an assembly line manufacturing approach.

They are small, so they can be easily transported to where they are needed, located more closely to population centers, and adverse events are expected to be easier to contain. In addition, by including the most modern technology, the safety of NuScale's SMRs is expected to be higher than for older reactors.

To be fair, NuScale isn't the only company working on SMR technology. However, it was ""the first SMR to receive U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) design approval."" It is currently the only SMR approved by the NRC, which the company believes gives it a bit of a leg up on the competition. But there's another important piece to the puzzle.

NuScale Power is working with RoPower, a Romanian electricity company, as it makes its final go/no go decision on a new nuclear power plant. That plant could end up being powered by six SMRs provided by NuScale Power that will be linked together. NuScale has already ordered parts that have long construction times for the six SMRs this project would require. But it has those same parts on order for another six reactors as well. In other words, the company is ready to hit the ground running.

The company's stock has risen around 200% or so over the past year. Wall Street clearly isn't ignoring the stock. However, with a final decision from RoPower expected sometime in the next year, NuScale Power could quickly change from a good idea to a real business. Notably, the second SMR sale should be much easier to get than the first, since the ice will have been broken. So NuScale Power could turn into a growth story very quickly.

Watch NuScale, even if you don't buy it

Nuclear power and SMRs aren't things that people talk about every day. But SMRs are a potential game-changing technology in the energy sector, with NuScale Power one of the companies leading the way into the future.

If that is interesting to you, and you are a more aggressive investor, you might want to consider buying before the first sale is inked. But even if you aren't interested in buying NuScale, it's worth learning about the huge energy opportunity that SMRs offer the world.

The collaboration aims to support growth for American solar manufacturing and create domestic job opportunities.

T1 Energy’s latest move clearly struck a chord with investors, as the stock’s 7-day share price return surged over 43%. This built on massive momentum with a 94.7% climb in the last month. Momentum really took off this year, with the 1-year total shareholder return topping 250%, even as longer-term returns are still catching up from past declines.

If you find these shifts in the renewables space compelling, it’s a great moment to broaden your search and discover

But with shares riding a powerful wave of optimism, the key question for investors now is whether T1 Energy is still trading at a bargain or if the market has already factored in all its future potential.

Most Popular Narrative: 21% Overvalued

Despite ambitious expectations for rapid business expansion and strong tailwinds, the current market price of $3.64 sits noticeably above the $3.00 fair value suggested by the most widely tracked narrative. Here is the core fundamental argument behind that valuation outlook.

The expansion of U.S. electricity demand, driven by the AI infrastructure build-out, electrification of transportation, and onshoring of advanced manufacturing, positions T1 as a key provider of solar modules and storage solutions for a rapidly growing market, supporting sustained topline revenue growth. Robust government policy tailwinds, including stackable, transferable Section 45X tax credits and protectionist trade measures, are providing T1 with access to funding, margin-boosting incentives, and risk mitigation for its U.S. production pipeline. This should improve both earnings quality and net margins.

Earnings power, revenue takeoff, and government incentives all build a case for T1’s future valuation leap. Analysts are betting on exceptional growth prospects and big margin improvements, but only the full narrative breaks down the bold assumptions fueling this premium price tag.

Result: Fair Value of $3.00 (OVERVALUED)

However, if government incentives weaken or T1 Energy fails to secure project financing, the company’s impressive growth outlook could encounter significant short-term hurdles.

Another View: Market Ratios Send a Mixed Signal

Looking at the price-to-sales ratio, T1 Energy appears reasonably valued against its peers. It trades at 3x sales, well below the average peer multiple of 15.4x and the fair ratio of 36.7x. However, compared to the US Electrical industry’s average of 2.3x, it appears slightly more expensive. Does this gap mean hidden risks, or could the market re-rate the stock closer to those higher multiples?

With Alliance Resource Partners now trading at a noticeable discount to analyst price targets and showing solid long-term returns, the key question is whether shares are undervalued or if the market is already factoring in the company’s future growth potential.

Most Popular Narrative: 17.9% Undervalued

With the narrative’s fair value set at $30.5, Alliance Resource Partners’ last close at $25.05 represents a significant gap that could catch opportunistic investors’ attention. This pricing difference is rooted in expectations for sector tailwinds and future profit expansion, setting the stage for a closer look at the underlying trends.

Recent legislative and administrative shifts in U.S. energy policy, such as regulatory reprieves for coal plants, the phasing out of renewable tax credits in favor of baseload power, and direct financial incentives to keep fossil fuel plants operational, have created the most favorable regulatory environment for coal in decades. These tailwinds should support stable or potentially higher future coal sales volumes and improve longer-term revenue visibility for Alliance Resource Partners.

Today, that means reducing our reliance on foreign-controlled clean energy components.
Clean energy dominance isn’t just about climate.","For decades, American energy dominance was measured in oil barrels and gas pipelines. But in a world powered by artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, true energy leadership is about more than fuel — it’s about building and owning the systems that power tomorrow’s economy.

Energy remains the backbone of economic and national strength. But how we use and produce it is changing rapidly. AI and cloud computing are driving massive new electricity demand. Data centers alone could more than double their energy use worldwide by 2030. In the U.S., they are projected to account for nearly half of all new electricity demand — alongside growth in electric vehicles, robotics and electrified industry.

Meeting this surge is a strategic challenge. The nation that builds the infrastructure for the AI-powered economy will lead the global one.

To meet rising demand, America needs a diverse, secure energy mix — from fossil fuels to solar, wind, advanced nuclear, hydrogen and storage. This isn’t ideology. It’s national interest.

Clean energy is:

Homegrown: Sun, wind and geothermal heat can’t be imported from adversaries.

Resilient: When paired with smart grids and batteries, clean energy boosts grid security.

Economically smart: Renewables are cost-competitive and create millions of American jobs.

Exportable: The U.S. can lead by exporting next-generation energy tech and infrastructure.

We shouldn’t just adapt to the energy transition — we should lead it.

Energy independence has long been a bipartisan goal. Today, that means reducing our reliance on foreign-controlled clean energy components. Right now, China controls more than 70% of global production capacity for solar panels, batteries and the minerals needed to build them.

That’s a strategic vulnerability. To secure our future, we must:

Re-shore manufacturing of clean tech.

Strengthen domestic mining and refining.

Build alliances to diversify global supply chains.

None of this works without a modern grid. That means:

Building cyber-resilient, high-capacity transmission.

Speeding up permitting while protecting safety and property.

Supporting U.S. innovation across energy technologies.

Clean energy dominance isn’t just about climate. It’s also about jobs, security and sovereignty. By investing in innovation, infrastructure and independence, America can lead the intelligent age — just as it led the industrial one.

340B a profit machine

Living with multiple chronic conditions means I know health care costs intimately. Every month, I weigh medication expenses against other living expenses — and sometimes the math forces me to delay or skip doses I need. Across Illinois and nationwide, countless patients face this same brutal calculus.

Despite understanding our health care system well, I was stunned to discover how a program designed to help vulnerable patients has become a profit machine for big hospitals and pharmacies.

Perhaps most people haven’t heard of the 340B prescription drug benefit, created in 1992 to help safety-net clinics serve low-income patients. Today, hundreds of big hospital systems have taken full advantage of this program. Instead of passing drug discounts to struggling patients, many hospitals pocket the difference as pure profit. Patients like me remain oblivious that our lifesaving medications generate millions for these institutions.

The betrayal deepens: Our state legislature wants to systemize the worst abuses through a law that would further enrich for-profit pharmacies at patients’ expense. While 340B desperately needs reform, those changes must come from Congress — and they must put patients first, not hospital profit margins.

The program meant to be our safety net has become their cash cow. It’s time to reclaim it.

— Karen Brown, Chicago

Transparency in 340B

Manufacturers make the world a better place to live, and there’s no clearer example of the impact they have on our daily lives than the wide array of safe and effective pharmaceuticals available to prevent, treat and manage medical conditions.

The production of reliable, quality medication is vital to public health, and manufacturers don’t take this responsibility lightly. That’s why biopharmaceutical manufacturers are committed to improving access to medicines in underserved communities, ensuring low-income and vulnerable populations can receive discounted drugs.

Initially, that was the promise of the 340B drug pricing program, which was designed to provide discounted medications to eligible health care providers serving low-income and vulnerable patients. Unfortunately, the program is increasingly being used by large, affluent health systems with little assurance savings are reaching the intended patients.

Consider the numbers: Only 21% of 340B pharmacy locations in Illinois are in low-income neighborhoods, and nearly 60% of participating hospitals provide less charity care than the national average. Unfortunately, legislation under consideration in Springfield would do little to address this. Instead, it would provide substantial protection for covered entities while obscuring the disclosure of their financial arrangements, making it impossible to see how much benefit is diverted from patients to these intermediaries.

If lawmakers want to lower health care costs, we need real transparency and accountability in 340B. Let’s work together to ensure low-income patients benefit from reduced drug prices, not the bottom lines of large hospital systems.

— Mark Denzler, president and CEO, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, Springfield

A fair map in Illinois

Kudos to the Tribune Editorial Board (“We strongly support this bipartisan plan to fix Illinois’ broken state elections,” Oct. 5) for its editorial support for fixing the broken state election system in Illinois with a fairer redistricting plan that would let voters pick their representatives going forward rather than the other way around!

The U.S. Constitution purports to guarantee each state a republican (with a small “r”) form of government, but that is not what a state has when districts are cynically drawn up to ensure one-party control, as is currently the case in Illinois.

It is therefore good to see a bipartisan effort led by prominent Democrat Bill Daley and Republican Ray LaHood to get a referendum on the ballot in November 2026 for an Illinois constitutional amendment to permit this and that Fair Maps Illinois has a specific plan to recommend, should the amendment pass.

That other states may also currently engage in partisan redistricting is no excuse for Illinoisans not to clean up our act, and — frankly — it rings hollow to hear Illinois politicians complain about other states when our own state has such unclean hands.

I thank the editorial board for its support of the Daley-LaHood proposal, and I urge all Illinois voters to sign the petition to help restore government of the people, by the people and for the people to the Land of Lincoln.

— David L. Applegate, Huntley

We can’t yield ground

Although the editorial proposal to make Illinois “fairer” in its elections is interesting, I believe the Tribune Editorial Board misses the point.

Republicans under President Donald Trump are busy gerrymandering Democrats out of existence in states such as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina. Illinois under Democratic leadership remains one of the few states in the country to stand up for humane, progressive values; immigrants; and minority rights.

Until both sides play fair, I believe Illinois cannot yield to Republican pressure to add seats, and this will never happen as long as Trump rules. I am proud to live in Illinois where the common citizen still has some rights over the rich and powerful. We can’t afford to yield any ground now.

— Ken Kramer, Glen Ellyn

Disagreement in church

The Rev. Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic priest, writes in an op-ed on Oct. 6 about the inconsistency between Catholic Church teaching and the practice of the same by some (“Public fight among Illinois bishops hurting church, nation”). He mentions the American Catholic Church several times being in disagreement with itself and briefly compares it with “African traditions” being “sacred spaces of decision.”

He correctly implies that Catholic Church doctrine is universal, i.e., global, but he minimizes the reality that the church exists in a world where nations play a major role in how Catholic teaching is practiced. The church views itself as being “in the world but not part of it.”

The role of the church is aimed at what is best for humans as taught by Christ, i.e., “full spectrum of human dignity and the common good.” In the secular world of nations, the same ideals for the most part are also sought. But a nation, in order to continue to be a nation, must first do what is necessary to preserve its nationhood, and that sometimes impinges on Catholic teaching, even causing disagreement within a nation’s Catholics.

Disagreement is part of the human experience, however, and hopefully brings about a positive result.

That's why it's a pleasant surprise to see two state legislators warn the Sabine River Authority that any attempt to sell water from the Toledo Bend Reservoir is a nonstarter. It's even better that the two legislators, Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, and Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, chair committees that would need to bless any such sale.

For those who have not spent time on the bucolic, 186,000-acre, 65-mile-long reservoir located on Louisiana's western border, let me explain. Toledo Bend was created when the Sabine River was dammed in the 1960s. It's become extremely popular as a recreation and fishing spot for thousands from both Louisiana and Texas.

It's governed jointly by Louisiana and Texas, through two different authorities, one on each side of the border. Water that flows through the dam on the reservoir's southern end is used to generate hydroelectric power; each side has the authority to sell some of the water, though the proceeds must be split.

But for several years, there have been discussions about selling a portion of Louisiana's share of the water to a company called Aqueduct Partners, which would pipe it to water-starved cities in Texas. Proponents argue that this sale could be done with little to no impact on lake levels and generate far more revenue than hydroelectric generation.

But the idea has drawn opposition from many locals, who argue that such a sale could cause water levels to drop and make the reservoir less amenable to recreation.

Earlier this week, Geymann and Hensgens sent a letter to Louisiana's Sabine River Authority, urging them to reject any proposed sale.

""We urge you to abandon these plans and safeguard the long-term interests of our people, economy and environment,"" Geymann and Hensgens wrote. ""Toledo Bend is vital to Louisiana residents, businesses and wildlife.""

They are right about that. But more important is something Hensgens told this newspaper's David Mitchell.

""I just believe that in the next century, water is going to be the most important natural resource we've got, and it is Louisiana's water. It belongs to the state taxpayers, and I just don't believe we should be selling it,"" Hensgens said.

Hensgens is absolutely right about this. Water is an increasingly valuable natural resource. Fortunately for Louisiana, the state is blessed with plenty of it both on the surface and under it. But there is little statewide impetus to take an accounting of just how much, despite increasing demands from industry, agriculture and, potentially, more data centers, which use a lot of water.

In other words, Louisiana is obviously water rich, but we have no idea exactly how rich we are. And until we know how much we have, we shouldn't be selling what we do have, no matter how tempting the dollar signs dangled by rich Texans.

Thankfully, Geymann and Hensgens' letter seems to indicate, at least for now, that no such deal will go forward.

It may be, at some point in the future, that selling Toledo Bend water is an idea that makes sense from a financial and resource-management perspective.

But that time has not yet come.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c4/6c4c578a-0ecc-54f8-8811-d036888c7de2/68d76ab30c7b2.image.jpg?crop=1602%2C841%2C29%2C2&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-12 13:07:13.446273

Across the country, more and more farmers have embraced solar power to make their farms run cleaner and protect the land they depend on while saving on utility costs.

Living and working in rural areas demands you to be self-sufficient. One of the best ways to ensure that people in rural areas have power – no matter how far they live from the nearest utility connection – is through solar power. By producing their own clean electricity, farmers can protect their livelihoods from an increasingly strained grid.

Many farmers across America are choosing solar for its reliability and cleanliness, in turn taking care of the soil, air and water that sustain us all. Solar allows farmers to ensure that the hard work they put into feeding the country is also benefiting the planet as a whole.

Here are three big ways farmers across America are putting solar to work:

Rooftop solar

As sure as the sun rises every morning, rooftop solar is a great way to harness all of that untapped power right on the same buildings that will use it. Barns have ample roof space and can collect a significant amount of energy to power a variety of farm equipment.

Just like so many households and businesses across the country, America’s farmers are reaping the benefits of rooftop solar. PennEnvironment, one of our 30 state groups, toured Shelmar Acres Farm (pictured above) in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After seeing their electricity price skyrocket, they took the plunge, installing solar on their hog barn and have not looked back. Soon after installation, Mitchell and Heather saw their electric bills drop from several thousand dollars a month to a few hundred.

Solar panels across farms: Agrivoltaics

Placing solar panels in strategic locations alongside crops (a practice called agrivoltaics) can have great benefits. Some forward-thinking farmers are installing solar panels on pastures, allowing sheep to graze under solar panel installations. This both prevents plant overgrowth, cutting down on mowing needs, and allows space for sheep to thrive. A study from Western University also highlighted the financial benefits of setups like these.

Agrivoltaics can also be great for pollinators. By planting pollinator friendly plants under solar panel installations, Farmers create some peace and security for bees, butterflies and other wildlife, all while helping to pollinate the surrounding areas. If well designed, pollinator friendly installations can improve crop pollination allowing for potentially higher yields.

Sun-powered equipment

With technology advancing every day, farmers are coming up with more ingenious ways to harness the power of the sun. Solar-powered water pumps are extremely versatile; they can be set up to work anywhere and make lugging gas to generators a thing of the past. Farmers are able to use solar-powered water pumps to irrigate their plants, provide water for their livestock or pump water to reservoirs for storage.

Tractors, UTVs and other utility vehicles all have electric options now, allowing them to be powered by solar, decreasing pollution and noise, long trips to the gas station, and maintenance time. Solar power also has the potential to power electric fences, eliminating the need to replace disposable batteries.",https://environmentamerica.org/center/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC05556-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 06:57:56.015386
