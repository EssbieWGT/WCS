Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal industry that the Republican administration has taken several steps to bolster.

Her home in West Davidson, a historically Black neighborhood, is just across the railroad tracks from Davidson College.

Springs is 84. She’s lived in this yellow, one story house since she was born. She raised her four children here.

“That's what I heat with,"" she says, pointing to an old propane furnace in the corner of her bedroom. There’s another one behind a chair in the living room. She has window units for air conditioning. There’s hardly any insulation in the walls.

It's too expensive for her to keep the A/C running in the summer. In the winter, those two furnaces can’t heat the whole house, which means maintaining a comfortable — and safe — temperature in her 100-year-old home is close to impossible.

That, however, is about to change.

“It's an older house, so it has all the little quirks of that,” said Edward McLean, the director of construction at Rebuilding Together. “One of the biggest things is the heat right now, because it doesn't have the ability to heat every room. We're going to try to take care of that.""

Rebuilding Together of Greater Charlotte provides free home repairs for low-income homeowners. The organization also leavea the home more energy efficient than they found it — adding insulation, caulking around the windows and electrical upgrades.

Insulation is a critical, but often overlooked, part of an energy-efficient home. Insulation traps A/C or heat inside, keeping indoor temperatures comfortable without placing excessive demand on the thermostat.

“It's more about windows and doors and insulation than it is the building itself,” said Beth Morrison-North, the director of Rebuilding Together.

Properly sealed windows and insulation aren’t cheap. Professional caulking services can cost up to $15 per foot — $1,500 for an entire house, and that’s a conservative estimate. Installing insulation in an attic can be over $1,000.

“The challenge for so many homeowners is they don't have the funds or the ability to do this kind of weatherization and sealing themselves,” said Morrison-North. “They definitely don't have enough money to pay for a new unit.”

That’s where Rebuilding Together comes in — weatherizing, adding insulation, and installing proper heating and cooling systems, among other repairs. The organization gets funding from Charlotte, North Carolina’s Housing Finance Agency, and a variety of private donors like Wells Fargo and Lowe's.

“Without programs like ours and others in the city to help to provide those critical repairs that let homeowners continue to stay in their home in a safe and healthy environment, they're a lot of times either forced to live in a really, really unsafe condition, or sell their home,” Morrison-North said.

McLean is doing a property assessment at Springs’ house, examining the repairs she applied for, central air and proper heating, and other potential fixes.

“There's no insulation in the crawl space,” McLean said. “So it wouldn't be a great use of the money to install a new HVAC system and then not put any insulation down there. And we're going to double-check the attic as well to make sure it's got adequate insulation.""

Springs got a screen door in the kitchen last week, and said she can feel the difference.

“It's cooler back there when you go in the kitchen to cook,” Springs said. “It'd be boiling hot ... standing there.”

Springs is not thinking about selling. Her whole life is in this home. She plans to keep working with Rebuilding Together to get air-conditioning and better heating. Until then, she’s working on a 1,000-piece puzzle to keep her mind off the weather.

“I do what I need to do — stay cool, try to drink water, plenty of water, and just do work,” Springs said. “Take it in one day at a time.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34eac32/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+146/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F71%2F45bdd2f540039da019db86fd9f46%2Fjunesprings.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 08:04:41.804182

The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers’ pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation’s most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that 2 million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, here is a roundup of when credits will go away.

Buy an EV before October

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren’t offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

Make home improvements by the end of the year

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don’t come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for certain low-income households.

Pay for solar this year

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the U.S. just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then so that could mean paying for — but not necessarily installing — a system by then.

Like with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”

So the Colorado EV credit of $1,500 will actually be only $750 for calendar year 2026.","Colorado’s revolutionary switch-over to clean electric vehicles may have to hit the brakes just as it was meant to be hitting the straightaway for maximum acceleration.

The Trump administration does not like recent policies pushing clean energy over traditional fossil fuels, and will be eliminating the most lucrative EV-buying subsidy of a $7,500 federal tax credit. State officials say that will now disappear Oct. 1.

The smaller but still helpful state tax credit is also scheduled to drop lower Jan. 1 as part of the preplanned transition to sustainable sales of EVs. And then over the summer, word came that because the state wasn’t meeting statutory budget targets for next year, all clean energy subsidies will be cut in half.

The Colorado Energy Office, a key agency in the state trying to reach the goal of 930,000 EVs on the road by 2030, is shouting out “buy now” advice to anyone who will listen. Here are some key facts and tips about the current EV market:

The federal bottom drops out come October

For the next two and a half months, the combined federal/state tax credits cut a moderately priced EV transaction by a stimulating $11,000, taken off right at the cash register. (The dealer does the paperwork and receives the credit later.) But Sept. 30 is now the last day to get the federal $7,500 portion of that big discount.

“Right now is the time to buy an EV for anybody in Colorado who has been thinking about it but was holding off or waiting,” Colorado Energy Office chief Will Toor said. “It’s your best financial opportunity for a while.”

Colorado adds a $3,500 discount through a tax credit (down from $5,000 last year), and then $2,500 more if the EV you are buying has an MSRP under $35,000.

“That’s $13,500 off if you’re buying a certain kind of vehicle,” Toor said. “We’re obviously very disappointed in that decision by Congress and President Trump to remove the tax credits, but given that they are, now’s the time to buy.”

From Oct. 1 through New Year’s Eve, what’s the story?

The current Colorado tax credit of $3,500 sticks around from Oct. 1 through Dec. 31, as well as the extra $2,500 in state credit for cheaper EVs.

New Year’s Day will mark a big turning point. The Colorado tax credit was scheduled to drop to $1,500. Toor explained that Colorado’s credit started high, at a time when it was unclear if federal tax credits would apply to enough available EVs because of federal regulations on how much of the vehicle needed to be built inside the U.S. to qualify.

“The idea was that we would have a larger state credit, while it was harder to get the federal credit, and then it would gradually see that phase down as the federal credit became more universal,” Toor said. “Unfortunately, as we’re seeing, the Trump administration is taking away the federal credit, but our credit still does phase down over time.”

Then price tags got even scarier. The Colorado budget has triggers built in, if projected revenue growth falls below a certain level, all clean energy credits like EV subsidies, electric bikes, electric heat pumps and more must be cut in half. So the Colorado EV credit of $1,500 will actually be only $750 for calendar year 2026.

The $2,500 extra for a new EV below $35,000 will stay in place, Toor said. There will also be millions of dollars of state money available again for the “cash for clunkers” program, where new EV buyers can get an extra $6,000 credit if they trade in a car that has failed emissions tests or is a certain number of years old.

That program, called Vehicle Exchange Colorado, is meant to stimulate replacement of older, higher-emissions gasoline cars in favor of cleaner EVs.

Will EV sales in Colorado plummet after the fall?

There’s bound to be a reaction, Toor said. When the retail price of many EVs remains thousands of dollars higher than the equivalent size gasoline car, ending an $11,000 discount will be noticed.

“We’re certainly concerned about the impacts, particularly when you add in the unknown impact of tariffs on the cost of vehicles — the potential for significant inflation and vehicle costs due to the Trump tariffs.” he said. “I think it just creates a lot of uncertainty going forward, from a state perspective.”

Nationally, a Reuters story said “Electric vehicle registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit, according to a joint study in November from professors at the University of California, Berkeley; Duke University and Stanford University.” Colorado numbers could hold up slightly better given the remaining state tax credits, and a strong dealer commitment to the EV changeover.

So is Colorado surrendering in the EV revolution?

Absolutely not, according to Toor and nonprofit clean energy leaders. Colorado will be redoubling efforts to control what it can by ensuring buildout of a reliable, ubiquitous fast-charging network for state EV drivers, Toor said.

States including Colorado won a lawsuit against the federal government to release billions of dollars in previously committed funds for the national fast-charging network, Toor said. So Colorado’s share of $44 million can now be spent, and much of it was already committed to projects that can now quickly seek contracts for construction, he said.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP24331826974585.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 07:07:19.705737

In short:

The GOP-led budget passed by Congress eliminates funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) and a Department of Energy (DOE) program supporting cleaner municipal fleets, including school buses and delivery trucks.

Clean Cities and Communities coalitions, which have supported electric, biodiesel, and propane vehicle deployment for over 30 years, say contract delays and funding shortfalls are already forcing staffing and program cuts.

Advocates warn that losing these programs will undermine efforts to cut air pollution, particularly in communities that suffer from diesel-related health problems like asthma.

Key quote:

“A lot of this stuff has been caught up in the political discourse. At the end of the day, people care about reducing pollution. Everyone wants to breathe clean air.”

— Antoine Thompson, CEO and executive director, Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition

Why this matters:

Diesel exhaust is a well-documented public health hazard, linked to asthma, heart disease, and early death, particularly in low-income and minority communities near highways, ports, and industrial centers. Federal programs like DERA and Clean Cities have helped cities replace aging diesel fleets with cleaner alternatives — often electric, propane, or biodiesel — while supporting a growing clean vehicle industry in states like Alabama and Texas. Slashing these programs could stall progress in reducing transportation emissions, which make up the largest share of U.S. greenhouse gases.

Clean energy opportunities power economic opportunity, energy independence, reliability and national security for Kansas — and for the nation.","Kansas has long been a cornerstone of America’s energy landscape. With abundant natural resources, a robust agricultural sector and a dedicated workforce, the state is well-positioned to help lead the next chapter of energy innovation. Among the emerging technologies poised to fuel economic growth and strengthen our power-generation security, clean energy is a practical, market-driven solution that aligns with core conservative values.

Kansas is a leader on clean energy — including biofuels, wind and solar — but it also has great opportunities with hydrogen, hydropower and energy storage.

Kansas agriculture benefits most from the vital role hydrogen plays in producing ammonia, the key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers that are essential to crop yields across the state’s vast wheat, corn and sorghum fields. Boosting the agricultural supply chain is vital for the manufacturing plants, farms and small businesses that form the backbone of the Kansas economy.

At the same time, solar has been providing important clean energy solutions for Kansas, whether through rooftop panels, ground mounts or battery storage. Kansas is well-positioned for solar expansion thanks to its flat terrain and abundant sunlight. The combination of steady solar energy output, strong economic incentives for farmers and community benefits from investment makes solar development a powerful catalyst for rural prosperity.

Promoting solar power directly supports community economic opportunities and job creation, especially in rural and economically challenged areas. It can diversify farm income, providing long-term, stable revenue even if crop decisions fluctuate; boost local skilled labor employment with jobs in construction, site prep and equipment installation, paving the way for local hiring; strengthen local tax base, funding schools, roads and essential public services in rural counties; and encourage infrastructure investment by improving rural grid reliability and access.

Tools such as the clean energy tax credits are essential to ensuring clean energy jobs and opportunities. They support entrepreneurship and innovation, enabling companies to decide where and how to invest based on economic viability rather than bureaucratic directives. Such policies stimulate growth while maintaining fiscal responsibility and limiting the role of government in the energy sector.

Kansas is also uniquely positioned to benefit from regional clean energy infrastructure development, drawing investments and expanding markets for Kansas businesses and workers. Participation in clean energy innovation attracts capital, supports manufacturing and boosts employment opportunities in the state.

Energy policy should prioritize practical solutions that foster economic growth and energy reliability, not ideological battles or burdensome regulations. Clean energy offers a path forward that strengthens Kansas’ energy infrastructure while adhering to the principles of free enterprise and national security.

Maintaining vital market-driving tax credits and investing in clean energy infrastructure position Kansas to take full advantage of the growing clean energy economy. By embracing clean energy, the state can build a resilient energy future, attract investment and support its communities with well-paying jobs. This approach ensures that Kansas remains a leader in energy innovation and economic development in the decades to come.

David McCormick of Pennsylvania will jointly announce roughly $70 billion of energy investments in the state Tuesday as the president travels to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda.

The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit will be held at Carnegie Mellon University, and it comes as the state’s political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy.

Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal industry that the Republican administration has taken several steps to bolster.

Neither the White House nor McCormick’s office gave breakdowns of the $70 billion or what the investments entail.

McCormick, a Republican first-term senator who is organizing the inaugural event, says the summit is meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. He says the investments will spur tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania.

“Pennsylvania is uniquely positioned because of abundant energy, of incredible skilled workers, technology,” McCormick said in a Fox News interview Monday promoting the summit. “We need to win the battle for AI innovation in America, and Pennsylvania is at the center of it.”

The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will also attend.

Administration officials speaking at the summit include White House crypto czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

In the Fox News interview, McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank.

Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “ AI Avenue ” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir.

Pennsylvania has scored several big investment wins in recent months, some of it driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business.

Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants.

Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, with more to come, while a one-time coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers.

Shapiro, elected in 2022, has been pushing for the state to land a big multibillion-dollar industrial project, like a semiconductor factory or an electric vehicle plant.

In his first budget speech, Shapiro — who is viewed as a potential White House contender in 2028 — told lawmakers that Pennsylvania needs to “get in the game” and warned that it would take money.

He didn’t land a mega project, but he instead has worked to play up big investments by Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Nippon Steel, as he prepares to seek a second term.

“It’s very clear to me that this will only amplify Illinois’ leadership role in driving clean energy forward,” he said.

The Illinois legislature made progress on a wide-ranging clean energy bill in the spring, and Walling would like to see that work continue when lawmakers return in the fall.","Already the calls are coming in at Chicago’s All Bright Solar.

Customers want solar roofs installed on their homes — and they want them before a federal tax credit worth about $8,000 expires at the end of the year.

The repeal of that tax credit under President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is “pretty catastrophic” for residential solar, according to All Bright owner Lisa Albrecht, who expects demand to fall sharply.

“I’ve been on the ‘solar-coaster’ for a long time, and this is the roughest ride,” said Albrecht, using a term for the dramatic highs and lows of the industry. “I’m definitely white-knuckling it. (Illinois) will lose jobs. We will lose installers.”

Residential solar is particularly hard hit, but the president’s far-reaching budget bill, signed July 4, has dealt a mighty blow to Illinois’ clean energy overall, ending a tax credit of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle buyers, reducing access to tax credits for battery and solar panel manufacturers, slowing the construction of wind and solar farms and leaving $14 billion of announced clean energy investment statewide at higher risk for cancelation or downsizing.

Under the bill, Illinois will see about 30% to 60% less clean power added to the grid by 2035, according to an analysis of a similar scenario by the Rhodium Group, a financial research firm.

The firm also found that there would be about 16% to 38% fewer electric vehicles on the road nationwide in 2035.

“This bill goes after the very foundation of a clean energy economy, and tips the scales toward fossil fuels instead. So it is an incredibly damaging blow to the clean energy transition … it will severely curtail deployment,” said Julie McNamara, the associate policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Still, she said, clean energy deployment will continue: “It will just come slower than it could and should have, and at higher cost.”

The bill comes at a time of growing concern about climate change, which is caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels and increases the likelihood of extreme weather events such as severe floods, multiyear droughts, record-breaking heat waves and raging wildfires.

Illinois clean energy supporters bemoaned what’s essentially the rollback of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has labeled the “green new scam” and targeted from the first days of his administration.

But even as they were licking their wounds, the state’s clean energy advocates were looking to the future.

Clean energy companies, environmentalists and trade associations are all now very focused on what can be done on a state level, said Jon Carson, founder and managing partner at Trajectory Energy Partners, a solar development company in Highland Park.

“It’s very clear to me that this will only amplify Illinois’ leadership role in driving clean energy forward,” he said.

Environmentalists and the clean energy industry had already been pushing for a new Illinois clean energy law, with provisions such as an ambitious new goal for large-scale energy storage, in which giant batteries absorb wind and solar energy when it’s not needed, and release it when it is.

Trump, a strong supporter of fossil fuels, has pressed for the repeal of Biden’s climate bill on the grounds that it unfairly favored some forms of energy over others.

“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” Trump said in a July 7 executive order on the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill. “… Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation.”

Large solar farms and onshore wind are the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation, even without tax subsidies, according to a 2025 report from the financial firm Lazard.

Wind and solar farms don’t run as constantly as gas or coal plants, but solutions such as battery storage can help produce a steadier and more predictable flow of electricity.

In the aftermath of the Trump bill, Illinois clean energy has an advantage; it still benefits from the state’s own ambitious climate law, the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, a signature achievement for Gov. JB Pritzker. The law sets a goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045.

Illinois has annual targets for wind and solar energy, and requires the utilities ComEd, Ameren Illinois and MidAmerican Energy to purchase increasing amounts of clean electricity. The state has an incentive for residential solar customers that’s worth nearly as much as the federal tax credit. And there’s a state rebate for electric vehicles of up to $4,000.

Illinois is expected to see a smaller reduction in new clean energy under the Trump bill than the nation as a whole, according to the Rhodium Group. The 30% to 60% less clean power that will be added here by 2035 compares with 57% to 72% less nationwide, according to Ben King, a director in the firm’s climate and energy practice.

“Part of that is just that Illinois is a great place to build wind, particularly downstate, and the economics of that are favorable in some cases, even without the tax credits,” King said.

But he added that Illinois’ clean energy policies also provide “guardrails” that protect the state from some of the impact of the Trump bill.

The Trump bill is expected to increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to an analysis by Princeton’s REPEAT project, which found the U.S. would emit roughly 470 million additional metric tons per year in 2035.

For comparison, 470 million metric tons is more than twice Illinois’ current annual greenhouse gas emissions.

The bill is also expected to cost Illinois jobs, with 21,000 fewer people employed in 2030, according to Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.

With the bill in place, the annual energy cost per household nationwide will be $170 higher in 2035, according to the think tank.

“We (will) lose a lot of low-cost renewables that are pushing prices down for household consumers as well as commercial businesses and industries,” O’Brien said. “So as a result of the bill, we’re likely to see pretty steep increases in the costs for people like you and me.”

King noted that $14 billion in clean energy investments — for manufacturing and utility-scale wind and solar — have been announced in Illinois but have not yet come online.

“A lot of that investment has been put at risk because of the changes in this bill,” he said.

Among those who want to respond to the Trump bill with strong state action is Jen Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council, which advocates for more than 100 organizations.

Illinois environmentalists have been pushing for the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, which would expand energy efficiency in Illinois and encourage renewable energy projects.

Walling said she wants the state to prioritize the addition of new transmission — the system, including high-voltage wires, that carries electricity across long distances. With more transmission, it’s faster and easier to add solar and wind projects to the electric grid.

Large battery arrays, which store energy from wind and solar farms and help make them more efficient, are also a priority, she said.

The Illinois legislature made progress on a wide-ranging clean energy bill in the spring, and Walling would like to see that work continue when lawmakers return in the fall.

“We have a big, beautiful bill that we need to get done,” she said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CTC-L-solar-consumer-solutions-007_201372592.jpg?w=1024&h=687,N,,2025-07-15 07:07:43.871819

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-15 09:58:06+00:00,rsmus.com,Tax bill significantly changes clean energy credits and incentives | RSM US,Not Available,,,,,https://rsmus.com/insights/services/business-tax/obbba-tax-clean-energy.html,"The law also modifies the rules for selling integrated components by limiting the creditability of an eligible component (primary component) that is incorporated into another eligible component (secondary component) by the same taxpayer.
Transferability Under pre-OBBBA law, 11 clean energy credits may be transferred under section 6418.
These are the section 30D clean vehicle credit and section 25E previously-owned clean vehicles credit, respectively.
For taxpayers considering clean energy investments particularly in wind and solar, adjustments to phaseouts and eligibility rules bring new challenges.
It is anticipated that additional IRS scrutiny of claimed clean energy credits may lead to increased examinations under the current administration.","The section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit

The OBBBA makes several changes related to what components are eligible for the section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit. Like the changes to the ITC and PTC, the section 45X credit would phase out differently based on type of component.

Wind components sold after 2027 would no longer be eligible for the credit. Changes to the eligibility rules for integrated components will apply to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026.

The law also modifies the rules for selling integrated components by limiting the creditability of an eligible component (primary component) that is incorporated into another eligible component (secondary component) by the same taxpayer. A taxpayer may only claim the 45X credit for the primary component if 65% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer to manufacture the secondary component are attributable to the primary component, and the secondary component is sold to an unrelated person.

The OBBBA also modifies what critical minerals are eligible for the section 45X credit. Metallurgical coal—a type of coal used in the steelmaking process—was added to the list of critical minerals with a phaseout for metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029.

Interestingly, the credit for metallurgical coal is available for production costs regardless of whether the production occurs outside of the United States. Such a credit is only useful to a credit claimant with a taxable presence in the United States.

Under pre-OBBBA law, there was no phaseout for the production and sale of critical minerals. The OBBBA phases out the credit for critical minerals produced in 2031 through 2033. A significant change to section 45X includes a prohibition on the credit for taxpayers that are prohibited foreign entities, or taxpayers that receive material assistance from prohibited foreign entities.

The section 48C qualifying advanced energy project credit

The OBBBA also modifies funding of the section 48C advanced energy project credit.

This credit requires taxpayers to apply for and receive an allocation from a pool of $10 billion of IRA funding. To date, the IRS, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Energy conducted two rounds of applications and allocated the entirety of the $10 billion.

Under pre-OBBBA law, the pool of $10 billion of IRA funding would be increased by the amount of funds revoked from projects that initially received an allocation and certification but ultimately fail to meet certification requirements by not placing the project in service within two years of receiving certification. Under the OBBBA, however, any certification revocations would not increase the pool of available funding, eliminating the possibility of a third round of applications.

For some taxpayers: Although credits for manufacturers remain, phaseout dates and eligibility rules will impact credit forecasting.

Increased and bonus credit amounts

The dual rate structure tied to prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for many energy credits would generally be left in place under the OBBBA. The energy community and domestic content bonus credits largely remain the same except for the addition of new nuclear energy communities to the energy community bonus credit rules and the correction to section 48E domestic content rules mentioned above.

Transferability

Under pre-OBBBA law, 11 clean energy credits may be transferred under section 6418. The ability to transfer an eligible credit is tied to the eligible credit’s phaseout date, meaning a taxpayer that could claim a credit could also transfer the credit. The OBBBA maintains the pairing of eligibility dates but prohibits several eligible credits from being transferred to specified foreign entities.

Changes to the transferable credits will impact the market of transferable credits as fewer projects qualify for credits.

Potential credit buyers should: Consider changes to the underlying credits during diligence and verify whether they are a specified foreign entity that may be ineligible for credit purchases.

Prohibited foreign entities

The OBBBA generally prohibits taxpayers from claiming several energy credits, in particular sections 45X, 45Y and 48E, if they receive material assistance from or have certain ties to certain foreign entities, including entities from China, Russia, North Korea or Iran. These complex restrictions generally apply to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Taxpayers should: Carefully review their organizational chart to determine whether influence or control by certain entities renders them ineligible for various energy credits.

Residential energy credits

The OBBBA phases out by the end of the year the following residential energy credits:

The section 25C energy efficient home improvement credit will no longer be available for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025

The section 25D residential clean energy credit will no longer be available for expenditures made after Dec. 31, 2025

Electric vehicles and alternative fuel refueling property

Credits for clean vehicles are to be phased out earliest under OBBBA modifications. Individuals may be eligible for credits for certain new and used plug-in hybrid or fully electric vehicles. These are the section 30D clean vehicle credit and section 25E previously-owned clean vehicles credit, respectively. In order to qualify, the buyer and the vehicle must meet various requirements. Under the OBBBA, buyers will also need to acquire those vehicles by Sept. 30, 2025, to remain eligible.

Businesses that use plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles in a trade or business may be eligible for the section 45W credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles. Like the credits for individuals, businesses must acquire vehicles by Sept. 30, 2025, to remain eligible for the credit.

Individuals or businesses installing EV chargers or other alternative fuel vehicle refueling property must place such property in service not later than June 30, 2026, to remain eligible for the section 30C credit.

RSM Washington National Tax takeaways: Implications for taxpayers with clean energy projects

While the OBBBA expedites phaseouts and credit termination dates for primarily wind, solar, electric vehicles and residential energy property, there are still significant incentives for the clean fuels industry and other clean energy sources, such as geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, fuel cell, and energy storage technology. Also important is that both transferability of credits and direct pay for certain entities, such as nonprofits and state and local governments, remain for energy projects.

With respect to manufacturing credits, it is important to note that the section 48C credit program was not eliminated. Taxpayers who received credit allocations are still able to claim this credit assuming program conditions are met. Further, credits for U.S. manufacturing of clean energy property and critical minerals also remain but with more restrictions relating to prohibited foreign entities.

For taxpayers considering clean energy investments particularly in wind and solar, adjustments to phaseouts and eligibility rules bring new challenges. Although the credits were not repealed entirely or retroactively, taxpayers will need to consider their ability to satisfy the new phaseout and eligibility requirements or risk losing anticipated credits. Further, condensed timelines for construction commencement and project completion are expected.

It is anticipated that additional IRS scrutiny of claimed clean energy credits may lead to increased examinations under the current administration. Thus, it will be important for project developers and credit claimants to ensure careful compliance with the new rules imposed by the OBBBA.

For example, new, complex rules restricting credit eligibility from foreign entities of concern may become a common foot fault for global project developers and new, inbound U.S. clean energy investments. Careful review of organizational charts and other records will be critical post-OBBBA.

Regarding commencement of construction safe harbors for wind and solar, a July 7, 2025, executive order instructs the Treasury secretary to take actions to ensure strict enforcement of the termination of the technology-neutral ITC and PTC under sections 48E and 45Y. Treasury guidance to be issued may change longstanding industry precedents. Taxpayers should monitor these developments to ensure compliance.

Further, it is important to note that the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are still applicable for most credits; thus, it remains imperative to document compliance with these labor requirements.

Taxpayers should work with their tax advisor to better understand how OBBBA provisions apply specifically to them and monitor for additional guidance.",https://rsmus.com/content/dam/rsm/1_real-world/energy/social/wind_energy_5_rw_social.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 07:07:48.439817

But some priority climate bills were voted down or left unresolved until next year.

Still, advocates said there are several policies to celebrate.

At the beginning of the legislative session, a statewide alliance of 39 conservation, climate action, and public health organizations known as the Environmental Priorities Coalition highlighted its nine priority areas with corresponding legislation for this year.

In a post-session look back, Maine Conservation Voters, which is part of the coalition, and the Maine Labor Climate Council also highlighted other key pieces of legislation related to labor, climate action and a responsible transition to clean energy.

“The last six months of advocating in Augusta were not without some nail-biting moments and disappointments, but the overall results for people and nature were positive and a testament to the hard work of legislative champions, strong coalitions, and the advocacy and activism of Maine people who care deeply about protecting the Maine we all love,” said Nick Janzen, director of policy and partnerships for Maine Conservation Voters.

Here’s a closer look at the wins, losses and what’s yet to be determined.

Environmental wins

Lawmakers approved LD 1270, which will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into a cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources. The new department will oversee the planning and coordination of state energy policy, as well as gain the authority to conduct competitive energy procurements.

“Maine families and businesses deserve access to energy they can count on and afford — and establishing the Maine Department of Energy Resources is an important step toward an energy future that works for Maine people,” said Gov. Janet Mills after signing the bill into law.

The department is expected to formally launch later this year and will be led by a commissioner appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature.

Mills also signed LD 1868, which enshrined a goal she set in 2023 of 100% clean electricity by 2040 into law.

“These bills passed at a moment when the federal government is actively undermining entire clean energy industries and putting skilled tradespeople out of work,” said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council. “Together, these ambitious bills put Maine on a pathway to energy independence and affordability, and will create thousands of good-paying Maine jobs.”

President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” signed into law earlier this month phases out clean energy tax credits while making it cheaper to drill and mine for fossil fuels on federal land.

As the state works toward its clean energy goal, there may also be a new database of clean energy construction projects to identify trends, improve interagency coordination and increase public transparency. Lawmakers passed LD 1850 directing the Governor’s Energy Office to compile such information, but Mills won’t decide on that legislation until January.

Though opponents saw another bill as an affront to supporters of a 2021 transmission line referendum, some environmental advocates were pleased Mills signed LD 810 into law. They argue it will streamline the approval process for transmission lines that may be necessary for the buildout of clean energy.

Advocates also celebrated passage of LD 1619, which will establish a commission to look into bringing a thermal energy networks program into Maine. Thermal energy networks use shared underground water-filled pipes to more efficiently distribute heating and cooling across buildings or a community.

Priorities voted down

There were two key climate priorities that lawmakers voted down.

Though it passed in the Senate, LD 1138 didn’t garner enough votes in the House of Representatives. That bill laid out a series of provisions that sought to reduce air pollution from the state’s transportation sector.

Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Maine, with most of it coming from personal vehicles.

Lawmakers in the lower chamber also rejected LD 1940, despite support from the Senate. That bill was seen as a way to ease the administrative burden on municipalities in growth management and comprehensive land use planning.

Bills carried over

Since lawmakers were juggling a difficult budget season, there were a number of climate-related bills that went unfunded and will be carried over to the next session, which starts in January.

This includes LD 646, which seeks to study the effects of stormwater pollution on waterways in the state. Additionally, there were multiple bills that passed but were ultimately not funded by the budget committee to bolster the Land for Maine’s Future program, which keeps forests, farmlands and working waterfronts open for natural and recreational use.

Advocates will also have to wait until next session to learn the outcome of LD 1870, which would establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other climate-related disasters.

Since other states have found themselves in a federal legal battle for passing similar legislation, lawmakers opted for more time to see how those pan out.

LD 1949, which was a late session bill that seeks to address the “twin challenges” of high energy costs and harmful fossil fuel emissions, was also left undecided. It passed the Senate 22-13, but did not receive a vote on the House floor so it was carried over to next year.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5077-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-07-15 07:07:51.509262

The oil and gas industry operates in an extremely complex and ever-evolving tax environment, one that presents a multitude of challenges for those involved in tax planning and compliance efforts.

The global nature of the industry means that oil and gas companies must comply with federal, state, local, and international tax rules, many of which are industry-specific and can change at any given time. These and other tax considerations specific to the oil and gas industry mean that companies involved in those industries must maintain an extraordinarily high level of diligence to avoid potential penalties for non-compliance.

New tax credits and benefits from the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’

The Trump administration’s new tax bill, enacted on July 4, 2025, repealed most of the regulations and clean-energy incentives contained in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Among the canceled provisions were a fee on methane emissions, credits for electric vehicles, and tax credits for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.

Other tax benefits the oil and gas industry received from passage of the bill:

Carbon capture tax credits: Introduces a series of tax credits to encourage the development of carbon-capture technologies that stores carbon underground.

Capital expenditure deductions: Changes the deduction rules for large capital expenditures (such as drilling and pipeline equipment) from phased depreciation over the life of the asset to “100% bonus depreciation,” which allows for immediate deduction of the full cost of qualified property in the year it was purchased.

Reduced royalty rates: Returns the royalty rates for offshore and onshore oil and gas drilling to 12.5%, down from 16.67% under the Biden administration.

Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs): Expands an already existing tax vehicle that allows pipeline operators and other entities organized under an MLP to pay taxes directly to investors, by-passing federal taxes.

Clean fuel credit extension: Extends credits for clean fuel production until 2030.

Lease sales: Expands the ability of oil and gas companies to obtain leases for drilling on public land in states such as Alaska, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, and North Dakota, as well as U.S.-controlled waters in the Gulf of Mexico.

Some expected changes did not end up in the final bill, however. For example, the Superfund cleanup tax implemented in 2022 remains in effect, and corporations with more than $1 billion in revenue are still subject to a 15% Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

Which taxes apply to oil and gas companies?

Aside from the taxes that most international companies pay (e.g., Federal corporate income and withholding taxes, sales and use taxes, indirect taxes (VAT/GST), excise taxes, etc.), oil and gas companies are subject to numerous taxes specifically related to the oil and gas industry.

Among these industry-specific taxes are:

Severance taxes: State-mandated taxes on the extraction of non-renewable resources such as oil and gas based on either the volume or value (“ad valorem”) of the extracted resources. Varies by state.

Environmental taxes: A bundle of taxes (e.g. Superfund tax, hazardous substance fees, waste disposal fees, etc.) aimed at pricing in the environmental impact of extracting and refining petroleum products.

Property taxes: For oil and gas companies, property taxes don’t just apply to the land a company owns or leases, but also to mineral rights, buildings, drilling rigs, storage facilities, and some types of equipment.

Royalty payments: Levies paid to the owners of mineral rights for the right to extract oil and gas. Royalties are not technically a tax, but they are a cost nonetheless.

Resource rent tax: Taxes “super” profits that exceed a pre-determined level of return on capital investments. Not applicable in the U.S., but popular internationally.

Oil and gas taxation in the U.S.

In the U.S., oil and gas companies encounter rules that do not pertain to operations outside the country. For example:

Severance taxes in the U.S.

More than 30 states in the U.S. have some form of severance tax on the extraction of oil and natural gas. Rates vary by state but are typically based on either a percentage of the market value of the oil or gas produced, or a fixed rate per unit of volume extracted. In most cases, severance taxes can be deducted from a company’s federal corporate income tax.

Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act’s 15% AMT on companies with a net income (as opposed to taxable income) exceeding $1 billion over three years is aimed at the world’s largest corporations, including gas and oil companies. In practice, the 15% minimum tax blunts the tax advantages oil and gas companies enjoy from being able to expense intangible drilling costs (IDCs), tax deferrals, and net operating loss deductions—all of which can significantly lower a company’s taxable income.

Property taxes

Property taxes apply to oil and gas companies in a few different ways. First, land owned or leased for oil and gas extraction is considered taxable property. Leased mineral rights are taxable as well and are usually based on the estimated value of the land’s reserves. “Ad valorem” taxes based on the assessed value of property such as buildings, drilling rigs, storage facilities, and other equipment and infrastructure are also taxed as property.

Intangible drilling costs (IDCs)

IDCs are expenses incurred during the exploration and development of oil and gas wells, such as permit fees, lease costs, surveys, fuel, testing, supplies, etc. Oil and gas companies subject to the AMT can now deduct 100% of their IDC for the year they are incurred. But because the AMT is based on financial statement income, not taxable income, IDC deductions don’t lower taxable income as much as they can for smaller oil and gas companies not subject to the AMT.

State corporate income taxes

Oil and gas companies must pay state corporate income taxes in the states in which they operate. Rates vary by state—from a low of 2.5% in North Carolina to a high of 9.8% in Minnesota—but certain states may have different rules for treating net operating losses and specific deductions. Some states, such as Alaska, use the worldwide combined reporting system, which considers a corporation’s global income, not just the income generated within the state, for its basis of taxation.

Water’s edge election

Some states that use the worldwide combined reporting system also offer a “water’s edge” election, which allows multinational companies to limit reporting to income from U.S. operations in exchange for a slightly higher tax rate. These states include California, Idaho, Montana, and North Carolina.

International oil and gas taxation

Depending on where their operations are located, oil and gas companies that do business internationally are subject to a wide range of different tax rules and potential compliance challenges. Among the most common compliance considerations are:

Global Minimum Tax

The 15% global minimum tax established by the OECD’s Pillar Two applies to multinational corporations with annual revenues exceeding 750 million euros. Under the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), countries and jurisdictions that tax profits at less than 15% can also impose a “top-up” tax to ensure that oil and gas companies pay at least 15% on their global profits.

Double taxation

Oil and gas companies can encounter double taxation if income earned in a foreign country is taxed by both that country and the company’s home country. However, several mechanisms—such as foreign tax credits, tax treaties, and various international tax rules—exist to mitigate the impacts of double taxation.

Transfer pricing

Because multinational oil and gas companies operate in so many countries and jurisdictions, and their operations are so multifaceted and complex, transfer pricing issues represent a significant compliance issue. Furthermore, international tax authorities tend to scrutinize transfer-pricing arrangements specifically to ensure that they adhere to the “arm’s length principle” of fair pricing of goods and services and do not involve profit-shifting to lower-tax jurisdictions.

Tax challenges and solutions for oil and gas companies

The overall scope and complexity of multinational oil and gas operations is such that even the most scrupulous tax departments can inadvertently miscalculate taxes or run afoul of international regulations. Complicating matters further is the fact that international tax laws, rates, and regulations are always changing, so keeping current with applicable rules is a challenge all its own.

Unfortunately, if oil and gas companies do not calculate their taxes correctly—for whatever reason—the consequences can be expensive and severe. Penalties, fines, audit-related costs, additional interest, operational disruptions, cash-flow strains, reputational damage, increased regulatory scrutiny, more frequent audits and compliance checks—these and other consequences of non-compliance not only have direct financial implications, they can also squander resources and impact the company’s operational effectiveness.

Automating tax determination

Oil and gas companies process millions of transactions and interactions every day. The only practical way to keep pace is to automate tax determination using a solution that can track and execute the company’s tax policies, scale to whatever size the company needs, and integrate with existing business systems, regardless of the company’s geographical footprint.

Large oil and gas companies are especially vulnerable to tax oversights and favorite targets for regulators. These companies need a solution that can manage transaction data of all kinds automatically, so that compliance teams can focus on minimizing tax liabilities and executing the organization’s larger tax strategy.

The federal effort could open a new battle in a long-running South Carolina war between traditional vehicle dealers, who sell their inventories under contracts with major manufacturers, and electric car makers, who claim they can offer lower prices by selling directly to consumers.

Direct vehicle sales to consumers are illegal in South Carolina, one of 17 states with laws still on the books that ban vehicle manufacturers from operating their own sales or factory repair centers. Fierce lobbying by the S.C. Auto Dealers Association, which represents 270 local dealers, blocked a proposal this year that would have changed the law, and an influential state senator who has been a key supporter of dealerships said it has little chance of resurrection.

The DOJ's anti-trust division intends to step in as its new Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force began studying state laws that it says serve special interests at consumer expense. President Donald Trump in April ordered agencies to reduce anti-competitive laws that create monopolies and make it harder for new companies to break into markets.

Roger Alford, principal deputy assistant attorney general, said in a recent Senate hearing that the task force received more than 400 public comments identifying what could be considered monopolistic laws, including recurring complaints about state vehicle sales laws that “stifle the free market.” He said DOJ will work with the Federal Trade Commission to revise these and other laws.

Alford said the department will work within state legislatures and with attorneys general to bring changes, but, if necessary, it will seek congressional action to preempt state laws.

It is uncertain how the new federal focus will fare in South Carolina, where the Legislature in February soundly defeated a proposal to change the franchise law. Solicitor General Robert Cook concluded in an advisory opinion on Feb. 7 that it would be illegal for manufacturers ""to sell new cars to South Carolina consumers or to repair cars.""

Sen. Larry Grooms, the longtime chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee who supports the dealers, said he was unaware of the DOJ effort but does not believe federal preemption would be successful.

""I don't see how, knowing the makeup of Congress right now, almost evenly divided with a slight edge for Republicans on both sides of the houses, you'd be able to preempt laws in 17 states,"" he said.

Grooms said his ""door is always open"" to ideas for new legislation. ""I'm always willing to listen, but I can't imagine the Justice Department being able to give compelling reasons why the General Assembly of South Carolina should advance legislation to undo our franchise laws.""

Electric vehicle makers such as Scout Motors Inc., which is investing $2 billion in a new manufacturing facility in Blythewood, contend that direct sales shave thousands of dollars off of consumer prices that would go to dealerships under the state law.

Blair Anderson, Scout’s vice president for government and regulatory affairs, said in a statement, ""We’ve seen in open states that direct sales work for consumers, workers, and even dealers. But when states block choice and protect entrenched interests at the expense of the American consumer and the American worker, it’s time for someone to step in.""

Proposed changes to the state’s franchise law have brought intense industry lobbying on both sides, pitting established electric car makers like Tesla, Rivian and Scout against the influential S.C. Auto Dealers Association.

Thousands of South Carolina residents are now buying new electric vehicles over the Internet, but they have to accept delivery in a state that allows direct sales. South Carolina law also forbids manufacturers from opening factory authorized service centers, which has forced owners to travel to repair centers in North Carolina, Georgia and other inconvenient locations.

In recent months, Elon Musk’s popular Tesla began directing South Carolina customers to an under-the-radar service location outside Columbia, which has no outside signage and can only do “light repairs,” according to an employee. After great fanfare early last year about its intention to open a regional parts distribution center in Fountain Inn, Tesla quietly opened the warehouse late last year with a few employees and has no signs identifying the company. Tesla did not respond to questions.

Rivian, a Michigan-based manufacturer whose electric trucks are popular among outdoor enthusiasts, late last year began scheduling South Carolina customers using its app to a new service location near Spartanburg that does have company signage. It also has revealed on its web site that it will soon open a service location in Ladson, news that has been enthusiastically received on social media by Rivian owners. Rivian did not respond to questions.

The state motor vehicle agency would not comment on specific locations that have opened in possible violation of the law.

If you miss out on the clean energy and efficiency credits, it’s not the end of the story.","If you were thinking about putting solar panels on your roof, buying an electric car or making your home more energy-efficient, time is quickly running out to take advantage of federal tax breaks that could be worth thousands of dollars.

Most of those credits are getting phased out this year under the policy bill signed into law by President Trump.

Here’s what to know about the federal tax breaks and how to get them while you can. We’ve also got tips on related programs that should be sticking around for longer.

Electric vehicles

If you’re interested in an electric vehicle, you would need to buy or lease the car by Sept. 30 to claim a federal tax credit that’s worth up to $7,500 for new vehicles or $4,000 for used ones.

A critical first step is to find a car dealer that has registered with the Internal Revenue Service to claim the credit. Here’s a map of registered dealers, which can use the tax break to directly reduce the car’s purchase price at the point of sale, so that you don’t have to wait for a refund on next year’s return.

Buying New

If you’re buying a new electric vehicle, the car needs to have been made in the United States and cost less than $55,000 (or less than $80,000 for S.U.V.s and pickup trucks) to qualify for the $7,500 credit. Here’s a list of the two dozen or so eligible vehicles. The new vehicle credit is available only to individual buyers earning $150,000 or less and to couples earning $300,000 or less.

Buying Used

If you’re buying a used electric vehicle, the car must cost $25,000 or less and be at least two years old to qualify for the $4,000 credit. Here’s a list of eligible vehicles. The used vehicle credit is available to individuals earning $75,000 or less and to couples earning $150,000 or less.

Leasing

Another popular option is to lease an electric vehicle for a few years. Until Sept. 30, car companies can apply the $7,500 credit directly to electric vehicles they lease, with no restrictions on income or models. Anyone interested in leasing should check the payment calculation to make sure the dealer has applied the tax credit.

“Leasing can be a great option if you’re not sure about the technology,” said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, a nonprofit group that promotes electric vehicles. “You’re not locked in.”

Other things to think about

If you want to install an electric vehicle charger at home, the federal tax break that can cover up to 30 percent of costs doesn’t expire until June 30, 2026. But if you need to upgrade your electrical panels to accommodate the charger, the tax break for doing so expires on Dec. 31, 2025.

Not ready to buy an electric vehicle now? Many states like California, Colorado, Illinois and New York will continue to offer their own rebates, potentially worth thousands of dollars, in the years ahead. Some electric utilities also run programs to defray charging costs.

Roughly one million used electric vehicles are also expected to come off lease over the next three years, creating a boom in the secondhand market. “We expect there will be some great deals to be had,” Ms. Malmgren said.

Rooftop solar

If you want to buy rooftop solar panels or a home battery for backup power, you’ll need to have them installed this year to claim a tax break worth 30 percent of costs. If you want to lease a system, you have more time.

Home solar systems can cost around $30,000, so start by calculating whether it’s a good investment. That means figuring out how much the panels will offset your electricity bills and whether you owe enough on your tax returns to claim the credit. Online estimates can help, but an expert assessment is crucial.

If you decide to go solar, note that the new law is ambiguous on whether you need to pay for the system by Dec. 31 or have it fully operating by then to meet the tax deadline. It’s safer not to wait until the last minute, since it can take a month or two for installers to receive the necessary approvals and for electric utilities to make any inspections or grid upgrades.

“You might only have until October or November, because of the time frames to install,” said Brett Bouchy, chief executive of Freedom Forever, one of the country’s largest residential solar installers. “So people really need to act now to make sure.”

There’s a longer window to lease a rooftop solar system, in which a third party owns the panels and the homeowner pays a monthly fee, ideally saving money on power bills. Solar leasing companies can use a different investment tax credit that won’t expire until at least the end of 2027 (and possibly longer, depending on how tax guidance from the Treasury Department shakes out).

Home energy upgrades

A separate tax credit to help make homes more energy efficient is also expiring after Dec. 31, 2025. If you want to upgrade your insulation, replace your doors or windows, swap out your furnace with an electric heat pump, or switch to a more efficient water heater, now is the time.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit covers up to 30 percent of the costs of efficiency improvements each year. The maximum you can claim is $2,000 for qualified heat pumps or water heaters, plus an additional $1,200 for certain upgrades to windows, doors or insulation that meet Energy Star or other standards. (Note that you can’t use this deduction if you don’t owe enough on your tax returns.)

These measures can lead to significant savings: In 2023, more than 2.3 million families used the credit and saved an average of $130 per year on their energy bills, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization.

“If you were already looking to replace your windows anyway, these credits are a no-brainer,” said Lowell Ungar, the group’s federal policy director. “But it can also be worth bringing in an expert and looking at your home holistically, because often a combination of insulation, air sealing and other upgrades can result in the best savings.”

Heat Pumps

Electric heat pumps, in particular, have received a lot of attention as an efficient, climate-friendly way to heat and cool homes. But whether a heat pump will lower your energy bills can be complicated, experts say.

If you’re currently heating your home with fuel oil or electric resistance heat, swapping in a heat pump will usually help save money. If you need to replace your central air-conditioner anyway, it may be worthwhile to pay slightly more for a heat pump that can both cool in the summer and provide heat in the winter.

But if you heat your home with natural gas, as many Americans do, a heat pump could either increase or decrease your bills. It’s worth consulting a specialist, and if you do want a heat pump, you may need to upgrade the vents or insulation in your home to reap savings.

Note that the tax credit can also be used to defray up to $600 of the cost of buying more efficient gas-burning appliances.

This calculator and electrification planner from Rewiring America can help you figure out what upgrades might save money and what incentives might be available.

What if I miss the deadlines?

If you miss out on the clean energy and efficiency credits, it’s not the end of the story. There are other programs out there.

Republicans didn’t repeal either of those programs, which will remain in place until the money runs out.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/14/climate/00cli-ask-evs/00cli-ask-evs-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 06:04:52.515297

Incremental progress So, in light of the state’s progress and aggressive goals, can Maryland meet its climate and energy goals on time?
The future is still cloudy for state climate action, though, thanks to the Trump administration’s slew of changes to federal climate and energy policy.","As the planet logs some of its warmest years on record, Maryland is trying to make good on some of the most ambitious climate goals in the country. But the state is struggling to keep up with deadlines it set for itself.

Maryland is halfway to its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions — the primary driver of climate change — by 60% by 2031, though progress has been at a standstill since 2020. It has another, more ambitious goal on the horizon: net zero emissions by 2045.

RELATED: Climate change is a local issue – here’s what’s happening in every part of MD

The state is also trying to transition to renewable energy, aiming for half of its electricity to come from renewables by 2030. That includes a significant chunk from solar energy, though experts say reaching these goals is proving difficult.

Federal opposition to state climate action poses a problem, too. In an April executive order, President Donald Trump directed his administration to halt the enforcement of state climate laws, calling them a threat to national security, the economy and “American energy dominance.”

Adding it all up, environmentalists see Maryland’s climate ambitions as laudable — but threatened.

“Maryland is not on track right now for either its renewable energy goals or for its climate goals,” said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Sierra Club. “That doesn’t mean that it can’t be on track, though, because there’s a lot of positive programs that will help improve people’s lives and reduce pollution and help with the climate.”

Reducing emissions

Maryland’s plans for emissions reductions are among the nation’s most ambitious — but the state is struggling to keep up with its ambitions.

A 2022 state law says by 2031, Maryland must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% compared to 2006. By 2045, it must produce net zero emissions of the gases that cause global warming.

Getting to a 60% reduction by 2031 would require programs to cut emissions of carbon dioxide — the main driver of climate change across Maryland’s economy — and cost $1 billion a year, according to the state’s Climate Pollution Reduction Plan.

Maryland reduced its emissions 30% by 2020, halfway to the 2031 goal, according to the state Department of the Environment‘s greenhouse gas inventory.

But the state hasn’t made progress since then. Though emissions vary across economic sectors, state officials are expecting to see a slight increase in statewide emissions from 2020 to 2023. This is because transportation emissions — the largest category — have increased 6% since the end of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown as emissions from electricity have dropped 10%, according to preliminary state data.

Meanwhile, the state hasn’t found a source for the $1 billion annual investment needed to reach its emissions goals.

“We don’t have cash coming in the door,” said Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters. “So that will slow down the implementation and meeting those reduction goals, no doubt about it.”

RELATED: Questions – and answers – about Maryland’s climate efforts

On top of that, the state just passed legislation to speed up permitting for new natural gas power plants amid concerns about high energy prices. That could worsen greenhouse gas emissions, though natural gas-fired power plants are cleaner than coal or oil plants.

Coble said she believes the state remains committed to its goals, but she’s pessimistic about meeting them on time because of money issues — including the Trump administration‘s impact on climate funding.

The federal administration has made cuts to state climate grants and dismissed climate researchers. It’s also started rolling back environmental regulations as it tries to reinvigorate the country’s fossil fuel industries.

“Under the [Joe] Biden administration they had billions of dollars going toward it, and I would have been far more optimistic,” Coble said. “But that money is in jeopardy, and those of us working in this field … don’t even know if it’s going to get deployed and how, what that looks like.”

Renewable energy

Maryland has been moving toward renewable energy for decades, but as of right now, it’s not on track to hit the goals set by the General Assembly six years ago.

Half of Maryland’s electricity consumption is supposed to come from renewable sources by 2030, according to a 2019 law. Within that half, 14.5% of consumption must come from solar power.

But the state is falling behind.

“At this rate, we won’t meet the 14.5% [solar] carveout by 2030,” Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said at a briefing earlier this year.

He was introducing a report published by the Maryland Energy Administration, which concluded renewables in Maryland and the surrounding region aren’t growing fast enough to keep up with state goals.

Experts also point to issues with the state’s system of incentivizing renewable energy. Electricity suppliers can either provide renewable energy by buying “credits,” or pay a fine that goes to a state fund for clean energy grants.

But in 2023, the latest year for which the state has data, renewable energy credits met less than half of the state’s goal and fines made up the rest. That’s a big drop from previous years, and the state said it happened because it was less expensive in 2023 for electric utilities to pay the fine than to pay for renewables.

A 2024 executive order from Gov. Wes Moore set another goal: 100% clean, in-state energy by 2035. The order told the Maryland Energy Administration to create a plan to get there.

Reaching that goal by 2035 is “extremely, extremely unlikely,” Pinsky said at the briefing.

Maryland is struggling to build renewable energy within state borders for a number of reasons.

It can be expensive and difficult to build large-scale facilities like solar farms in Maryland, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition’s advocacy arm, MAREC Action. Land constraints, high land prices and a crowded transmission grid complicate such efforts, he said.

A backup in project approvals on the regional electricity grid has also caused difficulties.

“While the state certainly does have a strong and growing renewable energy supply today, it does have some unique challenges,” Vaughan said. “You find … common trends across a lot of the smaller, land-constrained states on the East Coast in particular.”

Another law sets a goal of 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2031, equal to over half of Maryland’s total energy sales in 2023.

However, that buildout is in peril. The Trump administration paused leasing and permitting for new offshore projects earlier this year. On top of that, Rep. Andy Harris, State Sen. Mary Beth Carozza and Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan have asked the secretary of the interior to halt a federally approved project off Maryland’s Atlantic coast.

And on July 7, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to the Maryland Department of the Environment, citing a project permitting error. According to the letter, Maryland has to reissue the permit in question or risk having it invalidated.

Without new leases for offshore wind, the state won’t be able to achieve its goal, according to the Maryland Public Service Commission. The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” passed in July, will end tax breaks for renewable energy projects such as wind and solar.

Adding it all up, advocates and experts agree Maryland is not where it needs to be.

“You keep on hearing people say, ‘Maryland is a leader in clean energy,’” said Adam Dubitsky, consulting state director of the Maryland Land & Liberty Coalition, a conservative clean energy advocacy group. “And it is simply not true.”

In the General Assembly

While some advocates wanted more of a focus on climate or clean energy during this year’s state legislative session, they celebrated the wins that came their way.

Though advocates are still wary about the push to expedite natural gas, they supported other provisions of the final package such as battery storage procurement — which would store energy generated by wind, solar and fossil fuels — and rate reform. The package would also stop trash incineration from receiving renewable energy subsidies and includes new solar siting standards.

Moving forward, “we just have to figure out how we can responsibly deploy as many renewables and as much [energy] storage as possible,” said State Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, a Democrat from Montgomery County.

Supporters praised the new solar standards as a way to streamline projects and overcome restrictive county rules, but the standards drew backlash from Eastern Shore Republicans. They asked Moore to veto the bill, saying it could upend agriculture in their districts, but the governor signed it into law.

The package also moved Maryland toward new nuclear energy, which doesn’t produce carbon emissions. Environmental advocates are split on whether nuclear is a boon or a danger, but many lawmakers hailed new nuclear tech as a viable long-term option for clean, reliable energy. Nuclear power already makes up 40% of the electricity generated in Maryland.

“There appears to be an acknowledgement by the majority party and the leadership that we need to incorporate nuclear and natural gas in order to achieve the energy demands that we have in our state, which is a big deal,” said State Del. Jesse Pippy, a Republican from Frederick County who serves as minority whip.

Moore vetoed one of the three bills in the package, which would have set up a new energy planning office. Moore cited costs and overlap with other state agencies as reasons for the veto. The office would have focused on reliability and affordability alongside clean energy goals, and the bill drew praise from both sides of the aisle.

“It’s something that I believe we should have done from the very beginning, before we moved forward with all of our climate change legislation a few years back,” said Carozza, a Republican who represents Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties.

The governor also vetoed one study of the costs of greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland and one on data center impacts, frustrating environmental advocates.

Carozza said she believes the state should have known more about the cost of different energy sources, including wind, before enacting its climate goals.

“There now is a recognition at the state level that you cannot just depend on renewable energy to meet Maryland’s energy needs or Maryland’s climate change goals,” Carozza said.

Incremental progress

So, in light of the state’s progress and aggressive goals, can Maryland meet its climate and energy goals on time?

“I am not sure,” said State Sen. Malcolm Augustine, a Democrat from Prince George’s County who serves as president pro tem of the Senate and chair of an energy subcommittee. “But what I do know is that we’re going to work hard to try to achieve that.”

The energy package the General Assembly passed this year moves the state in the right direction, he said. It doesn’t mean the state is backing off its goals but finding a “more achievable route.”

The goals remain state law and Maryland still takes climate change seriously, said State Sen. Brian Feldman, a Democrat from Montgomery County and chair of the Education, Energy and the Environment Committee. He was a lead sponsor of this year’s solar siting bill and sponsored the 2019 law that boosted Maryland’s renewable energy goal to 50% by 2030.

But some advocates felt there wasn’t enough of an emphasis on climate action during the spring legislative session.

“Climate didn’t stay in the conversation the way it should have,” said Tulkin, the Maryland Sierra Club director.

The future is still cloudy for state climate action, though, thanks to the Trump administration’s slew of changes to federal climate and energy policy. Among a host of other actions from the administration, a Trump executive order directs the U.S. attorney general to identify and stop state laws addressing climate change, emissions or environmental justice issues.

Pinsky wrote in response that the move was “worse than irresponsible” and disruptive, accusing the administration of interfering with state matters during a global crisis.

Even so, other climate advocates note Maryland is moving in the right direction despite the challenges it faces.

“What we need to do is just keep taking steps forward,” Coble said. “We just keep chipping away at it, and if we continue to take two to three steps forward every year, it is a whole lot better than doing nothing, that’s for sure.”

A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that Trump has taken steps to boost U.S. energy production.
At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump called wind and solar energy ""a blight"" on the country.
The cost of wind and solar projects has fallen dramatically.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration already expected prices for the fuel to increase, mainly due to demand from facilities that export liquified natural gas around the world.","The law that President Trump signed on July 4 ending tax incentives for wind and solar projects is expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Without tax credits, the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies are likely to respond by building fewer of those projects, and those facilities that do come online will have bigger price tags, according to multiple estimates. As that happens, the country is expected to generate more electricity from natural gas plants, which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar projects.

That shift will hit hardest in states that don't have their own policies to drive renewable energy development, says Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation. In Oklahoma, for example, homeowners, renters and businesses are likely to see electricity rates shoot up by between 60% and 350% over the next decade, according to Energy Innovation. The firm expects rates to rise by at least 48% in Kentucky, 39% in Missouri and 30% in Kansas. The congressional delegations of those states are overwhelmingly Republican.

""In a world before the bill, you would have a lot of cheap renewables"" built regardless of state policies, O'Brien says. ""But after the bill, there's nothing making sure those keep coming on, so you're seeing a lot more expensive gas generation.""

A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that Trump has taken steps to boost U.S. energy production.

""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will turbocharge energy production by streamlining operations for maximum efficiency and expanding domestic production capacity, which will deliver further relief to American families and businesses,"" Rogers said.

At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump called wind and solar energy ""a blight"" on the country. ""They hurt our country very badly,"" he said. ""And smart countries don't use it.""

Wind and solar industries are in turmoil

Renewable energy was the top source of new electricity generation globally last year, with much of it installed in China, according to the International Energy Agency.

""Chinese leadership does understand how big a problem climate change is. They're getting hurt by climate impacts,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. But, he says, ""once you get into it, you're like, 'Oh, wait a minute — this just makes economic sense.'""

The cost of wind and solar projects has fallen dramatically. In the U.S., those industries — like the fossil fuel sector — have also been helped for decades by federal tax incentives.

""Wind is a critical part of our nation's all-of-the-above energy strategy,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who calls himself the ""father"" of the wind-energy tax credit, said several years ago when wind farms became his state's biggest source of electricity. ""It creates thousands of jobs, supports economic development, boosts tax receipts, attracts investment in our state and puts extra money in farmers' pockets.""

But for years, renewable energy executives and advocates have debated when and how to get off subsidies. Those discussions ramped up when the incentives were threatened by Congress, says Paula Mints, founder and chief analyst at SPV Market Research.

""I think we've become complacent, dependent on these tax credits, and I think we need to finally phase them out,"" Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures, said this month as the Senate debated cutting the incentives as part of the tax-and-spending bill.

However, the industry urged lawmakers to unwind the tax credits gradually to give companies time to adjust. What companies have gotten instead is chaos.

""I would characterize this as a high degree of volatility expected over the next year,"" says Ryan Sweezey, director of North America power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research firm. ""I mean, the policy situation is still not clear.""

Under a deal struck by Republican senators, wind and solar projects are eligible for tax incentives as long as companies start construction within the next year and finish within four. That timeline was in the bill that Trump signed on July 4, setting up a scramble for companies to begin working on as many projects as possible.

But that was upended last week when Trump issued an executive order that directs the Treasury secretary to consider issuing new guidance for what companies have to do to meet the government's ""beginning of construction"" standard. The goal is to keep companies from circumventing tax laws, according to the order.

Now, companies that build wind and solar projects are trying to figure out whether investors are going to put their deals on hold until they know what the administration will do, says Keith Martin, a lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright.

""This Trump era is like trying to do business while bouncing up and down on a trampoline,"" Martin says, adding, ""It's very hard to do business in that atmosphere.""

The U.S. is expected to burn more natural gas

The moves have thrown America's wind and solar industries into turmoil at a time when electricity demand is expected to increase significantly for the first time in decades. Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

Those wind and solar plants will get more expensive when tax incentives disappear, potentially changing companies' investment decisions. New power generation in the U.S. is expected to fall by about a third over the next decade, mainly due to wind and solar projects that won't come online, says O'Brien of Energy Innovation.

While renewables are technically the cheapest source of new power generation, even without government subsidies, that doesn't account for the cost of tying intermittent resources into the power grid. As more wind and solar comes online, investing in things like batteries becomes more important so that electricity can be delivered when it's needed.

At the same time that activity in the renewables market is expected to slow, a shortage of gas turbines will prevent companies from building more natural gas plants than they had already planned to bring online in the next five years, according to Energy Innovation.

""We're already running our cheaper gas generation facilities a lot in the U.S.,"" O'Brien says. ""And we have more capacity. We can dip into that in more hours. But those are the generators that cost more per hour to run.""

Operating those plants could get even more expensive as gas demand rises. The U.S. Energy Information Administration already expected prices for the fuel to increase, mainly due to demand from facilities that export liquified natural gas around the world.

""The timing here is not great,"" says Sweezey of Wood Mackenzie.

Less renewables, more emissions

While electricity rates are expected to skyrocket in some states, Energy Innovation says costs are likely to rise across the country. Nationally, rates will increase by 9% to 18% on average by 2035, the firm says, and the U.S. will lose out on billions of dollars in planned investment and hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Renewable energy manufacturing could get hit especially hard. Companies that have opened U.S. factories to make solar panels and other components have said abruptly unwinding clean energy tax incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector. The tax credits that are being eliminated encourage companies that build power plants to buy American-made products, like solar panels and other components.

The U.S. will also cut less of the climate pollution that's contributing to more intense storms, floods and wildfires.

Under Republicans' new tax-and-spending law, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall by 25% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to an analysis by the ZERO Lab at Princeton University and Evolved Energy Research. That's little progress from where the country is now. Last year, emissions were about 20% below 2005 levels, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Under Biden-era policies, emissions would have fallen by at least 40% from 2005 levels by 2035, researchers at the ZERO Lab and Evolved Energy Research said.

""I don't think subsidizing electricity just as a general matter necessarily makes sense,"" says Noah Kaufman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Joe Biden. However, tax incentives for clean energy were extended during the Biden administration ""as part of a broader strategy,"" Kaufman says, ""to address climate change and to better prepare the U.S. energy system and economy for the global energy transition.""

""Now,"" Kaufman adds, ""I think it's fair to say the Trump administration doesn't share either of those goals.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5472x3078+0+285/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2Fdb%2F2458e28d40e9950248dd7a0652a2%2Fgettyimages-1303397419.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 06:04:55.840393

“You’re taking our capability away.” Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety.
Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division.
That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.” But that federal support is no longer a sure thing.","With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.

President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.

Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.

“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”

Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.

Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.

Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.

State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.

As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.

“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”

Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.

Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.

The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.

Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”

Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.

“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.

He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.

“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”

But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.

Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.

While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.

“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”

Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.

“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.

“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”

Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.

Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.

Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.

“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”

FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.

Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.

The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.

“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”

Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.

“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”

She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

This represents a 61% increase from the previous year’s figure.

Renewables such as solar and wind constituted 43% of California’s power mix in 2023, an uptick from the preceding year, with large hydroelectricity and nuclear power each contributing another 12%.

These efforts align with Newsom’s plan to add 148GW of new clean power by 2045.

Investments since 2010 have catalysed rapid development across clean energy production.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have dropped by 20% since 2000, while economic output rose by nearly 78% during this period.

Newsom stated: “California is making our clean energy future a reality. The world’s fourth-largest economy is running on two-thirds clean power – the largest economy on the planet to achieve this milestone.

“And for the first time ever, clean energy provided 100% of the state’s power nearly every day this year for some part of the day. Not since the Industrial Revolution have we seen this kind of rapid transformation.”

The state added 7,000MW of clean capacity to its grid in 2024 alone, which represents the largest single-year increase recorded for California, indicating a continuous three years of growth within the sector.

Solar technology dominates installed renewable energy capacity in the state, with the recent solar peak, seen in late May 2025, exceeding 21,500MW.

The state is also expanding its battery storage capabilities, which now exceed 15GW. The growing fleet stores excess daytime solar production for evening use.

Congress allocated IRA funds for REAP applications through 2031, though the funding will likely run out long before then.
His company, EIM LLC, had seven people working full time on REAP applications over the past three months in anticipation of the July 1 application window.","For over two decades, Bruce Everly has been helping Indiana farmers apply for funding from the federal Rural Energy for America Program, which provides grants for solar, wind, energy-efficiency upgrades, grain dryers, biodigesters, and other projects in rural America.

He’s seen it serve as an economic lifeline for small farmers, especially the state’s poultry producers who operate on thin profit margins.

But the program, known as REAP, has faced a series of setbacks under the Trump administration. Nearly $1 billion in funding was frozen for months, farmers have heard nothing about applications filed last fall — and now a window for new applications that was supposed to open July 1 was closed at the last minute.

Meanwhile, the most common use case for REAP grants, helping farmers install solar, is under direct threat from the administration. A recent U.S. Department of Agriculture document outlining its Make Agriculture Great Again agenda says that, going forward, REAP ​“will disincentivize funding for solar panels on productive farmland.”

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act infused REAP with over $2 billion, but those funds will soon run out, meaning the program will likely revert to the lower funding level of $50 million per year ensured by the current iteration of the federal Farm Bill.

“We’re not looking at an IRA-like opportunity for REAP again any time soon,” said Lloyd Ritter, founder of the clean-energy policy consultancy Green Capitol. He helped draft the original REAP program as senior counsel for former Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).

A slowdown in REAP funding would be a blow to the thousands of American farmers who use the program nationwide, forcing them to spend more money to meet their energy needs. And the efforts to block REAP funds from solar projects in particular would both stymie the growth of clean energy in rural areas and hamper what’s become a key source of income for farmers.

“This program has been key to helping people who don’t have a lot of assets make a change and provide some cash flow for their family,” said Everly, who has assisted with REAP grants to turn manure into biofuel, grow vegetables year-round in indoor enclosures, and add ​“desperately needed” energy efficiency to poultry barns.

A boon and bust

The 2002 Farm Bill created the program now known as REAP; it was given its current name under the 2008 Farm Bill.

For more than two decades, the program has offered loan guarantees and grants to farmers and rural small businesses, as well as doled out grants to organizations that provide applicants with technical assistance.

Under the Farm Bill, REAP grants reimbursed recipients for up to a quarter of a project’s cost. The IRA increased reimbursement to up to 50% of a project’s cost.

USDA data shows that more than $1 billion in IRA REAP funding was awarded in over 6,800 grants to farmers and rural small businesses between fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to an analysis by the Environmental Law & Policy Center, with 80% of the grants going to Republican House districts.

Congress allocated IRA funds for REAP applications through 2031, though the funding will likely run out long before then. Federal data shows that about half of IRA REAP funds have already been obligated.

President Donald Trump froze over $911 million in REAP funds with his Day 1 executive order targeting IRA programs. His administration lifted the freeze in late March and has yet to make another attempt at clawing back already-promised IRA REAP funds, as some advocates had feared would happen — especially for solar projects.

Nonetheless, farmers and experts who monitor the program wonder whether expected grant payments will be disbursed or new applications accepted in coming months, and whether farmers will still trust the program after this period of chaos.

REAP grants are administered through reimbursement, meaning uncertainty is particularly harmful. Farmers and other recipients make significant up-front investments with their own money under the assumption that the government will honor its commitment to pay them back.

“This year, since Jan. 20, has been incredible levels of stress for people who did not understand if they would ever get paid for work where they have already put down millions of dollars on projects,” said Everly.

“No matter what the government does, the harvest happens at the same time every year. Farmers had made investments with hope of help from the government, and there’s great uncertainty right now.”

A window closed

On June 30, the USDA released a statement saying that the fiscal year 2026 REAP application period that was supposed to run from July 1 to Sept. 30 would not happen.

“This decision was made due to the overwhelming response and continued popularity of the program resulting in a backlog of applicants,” the brief statement says. The USDA said it ​“anticipates” accepting applications again starting Oct. 1.

Meanwhile, the agency has yet to announce decisions on applications submitted last fall, farmers and the advocates who help them with REAP applications told Canary Media. Usually, farmers and technical assistance organizations feel fairly confident that a strong proposal will receive an award, and many made plans expecting to receive funding, Everly said. Now, they are unsure.

REAP only reimburses projects that were started after the application was submitted, so many farmers planning to apply this round had postponed breaking ground on projects until after July 1, Everly said. But with the sudden delay, they must now choose to either move forward without REAP funding or kick needed upgrades down the road once more.

The number of REAP award decisions is indeed down significantly this year, according to an analysis by the Environmental Law & Policy Center. Federal data obtained by the group through a public records request shows the USDA obligated money for just over 1,900 grant and loan guarantees between the start of this fiscal year and July 9; almost 2,400 obligations were made during the same period last year. While the money awarded for grants so far this year is only slightly less than last year, the dollars for loan guarantees are drastically lower.

Everly was hired by the Indiana state government to help farmers file REAP applications in the program’s early days, then founded a firm now staffed by his wife and more than a dozen employees.

His company, EIM LLC, had seven people working full time on REAP applications over the past three months in anticipation of the July 1 application window. They only get paid once projects come to fruition. REAP data from the USDA shows that the company was awarded five grants for $100,000 each in fiscal year 2023, but has received only about $25,000 thus far.

Everly said his firm has a 92% success rate in applications, so the wait for payment is not usually a problem. But now he’s uncertain if the 3,000 hours of staff time spent on this latest round of applications will ever be compensated.

“We don’t know if we’ll ever get paid for any of the work we did,” said Everly, whose family also owns two farms in the state, one going back seven generations. He said his firm can survive the possible financial setback, but many farmers are working on tighter margins. ​“We’ve helped a lot of people who really need the help” from REAP funds.

A rollercoaster

The canceled July application window was just the latest disruption in what’s been a chaotic year for REAP.

On March 26, USDA sent a cryptic letter to REAP and other rural agriculture grant recipients noting that the funding freeze was over, and they had 30 days to ​“voluntarily” alter their applications to remove ​“any harmful [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility] project features” or to use ​“more affordable and effective energy sources.” The letter indicated grants would be paid even without changes.

Amanda Pankau, director of energy and community resiliency at the environmental nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network, said REAP recipients her organization works with in Illinois were alarmed by the freeze and then confused by the letter, especially since switching to an energy source other than solar wasn’t an option, and most projects did not have DEIA components. Indeed, federal data shows that over the past decade, 82% of REAP grants went to recipients identified as white, and 75% went to men or businesses owned by men.

“The federal freeze and policy chaos, including the confusion surrounding the March 26 letter, created real distress for Illinois’ farmers and rural small businesses,” Pankau said. ​“We know that rural farmers and small business owners are already managing intense stress and thin profit margins. Many don’t have the privilege of a financial cushion to absorb months of federal uncertainty for clean energy projects that were already awarded or underway.”

In mid-April, a federal judge ruled that the USDA must pay out billions of dollars promised under the IRA, including from REAP and other clean energy programs such as Empowering Rural America, Powering Affordable Clean Energy, and Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities.

The following week, on April 25, three congressional Democrats from Minnesota — Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, along with Rep. Angie Craig — sent a letter to the USDA demanding answers about REAP funds that appeared to still be frozen.

The tumult has had lasting impacts on farmers, technical assistance organizations, and solar developers, multiple sources told Canary Media.

“People are being whipsawed out there, who are just trying to use the program to install clean energy and cut energy waste,” said Andy Olsen, senior policy advocate for the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

Tim Biello is the owner and manager of Featherbed Lane Farm, a regenerative farm supplying community-supported agriculture in upstate New York. He learned in January that he had received REAP funding for a 30-kilowatt, $115,000 solar project. After the freeze, he wondered whether he should really start the project, since he can’t afford it without REAP reimbursement.

“I got awarded, which was awesome news,” said Biello in May. ​“Then we got the notice it was frozen. The solar company was just about to put a $50,000 to $75,000 order for panels. We canceled that; the advice was not to proceed unless you can take it on with no reimbursement.”

Biello said at the time that he assumed he would get the promised payment, ​“but I don’t feel like anything now is guaranteed, even if you have a signed contract with the government.”

Ultimately, Biello decided to install the solar project this summer, after learning the funds were unfrozen and consulting with advisers. In early July, he could finally take a breath of relief: The USDA officially reimbursed him.

Farmers in Iowa have similar trepidation, according to Mike Brummer, sales manager at Eagle Point Solar, an installer that counts REAP grantees among its customers.

“We’re at this point trying to treat it as business as usual. Let’s keep talking about the project, moving forward with the necessary items,” Brummer said. ​“I joke I’ll check my Twitter account at 2 a.m. for an update.”

He said many farmers can only do solar projects with the help of REAP.

“The REAP grant can make or break a project, especially for a small farmer or small business,” he said. ​“For farmers, every penny has a name on it before it hits the bank. The more pennies you can save, the more chance you have of enduring as a farm and being able to go to the next generation.”

The future

Everly has three wishes for REAP going forward: clarity on the status of application windows and the program’s future; full funding through the Farm Bill, so that 50% reimbursement can continue; and staff support from the USDA.

Given the turmoil of the past six months, Everly and others are worried that farmers won’t trust REAP as a resource even if the USDA takes applications again. Everly noted that the average farmer only has about 40 harvest seasons in their life, and with so many resources sunk into each season, they can’t afford to take many risks.

“Any time you create uncertainty,” farmers will be dissuaded, he said. ​“They only get to run this experiment 40 times in their life. If you messed up two of them, it’s hard to get their faith back. One mistake and you’ve lost multiple generations of wealth.”

Ritter at Green Capitol shares Everly’s concern about federal layoffs impacting REAP. In May, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told lawmakers that the USDA was trying to fill critical positions after more than 15,000 agency employees took buyouts aimed at reducing the federal workforce.

“My biggest fear is the staffing cuts at USDA will hurt program implementation and efficiency and speed,” Ritter said.

He emphasized the bipartisan support that REAP has long enjoyed, and said he hopes and expects that popularity will help the program weather tough times.

“REAP just makes sense,” said Ritter. ​“The vast bulk of applicants are farmers, ranchers, [and] rural small businesses using it to help lower energy costs and build energy dominance in rural America. Despite unfair and unreasonable attacks from the far right, I think REAP will be OK.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1701284727.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d64fb87646c3b8b8384a1eb1458ad798,N,,2025-07-15 06:03:50.109621

Dear members of the media,

Today, we launch the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2025. Under-Secretary-General Li will go through the details. But allow me to kick things off.

We are now 10 years into our collective journey toward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Report is a snapshot of where we stand today. Since 2015, millions more people have gained access to electricity, clean cooking and the Internet. Social protection now reaches over half the world’s population — a significant increase from just a decade ago. Access to education has continued to increase and more girls are staying in school. Child marriage is declining. Renewable energy capacity is growing, with developing countries leading the way. And women’s representation is rising — across governments, businesses and societies.

These gains show that investments in development and inclusion yield results. But let’s be clear: we are not where we need to be. Only 35 per cent of SDG targets are on track or making moderate progress. Nearly half are moving too slowly. And 18 per cent are going in reverse. We are in a global development emergency. An emergency measured in the over 800 million people still living in extreme poverty. In intensifying climate impacts. And in relentless debt service, draining the resources that countries need to invest in their people.

We must also recognize the deep linkages between underdevelopment and conflicts. That’s why we must keep working for peace in the Middle East. We need an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate release of all hostages and unimpeded humanitarian access as a first step to achieve the two-State solution. We need the ceasefire between Iran and Israel to hold. We need a just and lasting peace in Ukraine based on the UN Charter, international law and UN resolutions. We need an end to the horror and bloodshed in Sudan. From the DRC to Somalia, from the Sahel to Myanmar, we know that sustainable peace requires sustainable development.

In the face of these challenges, the Report we are launching today points the way to progress. Transformational pathways — in food, energy, digital access, education, jobs and climate — are our road map. Progress in one area can multiply progress across all of them. But we must move faster, and we must move together.

That means advancing affordable, quality healthcare for all. Investing in women and girls as a central driver of progress. Focusing on quality education and creating decent jobs and economic opportunities that leave no one behind. Closing the digital divide and ensuring that technologies like artificial intelligence are used responsibly and inclusively. And it means recognizing a fundamental fact. Progress is impossible without unlocking financing at scale.

The recent Sevilla Commitment reflected a commitment to get the engine of development revving again. Through reform of the international financial architecture, real action on debt relief and tripling the lending capacity of multilateral development banks so countries can better access capital at scale and at a reasonable cost. We have more opportunities to drive these priorities forward — from the High-Level Political Forum to the Second Food Systems Stocktake Summit to the World Social Summit and more. We must maximize these moments for real commitments — and real delivery.

Today’s Report shows that the Sustainable Development Goals are still within reach. But only if we act — with urgency, unity and unwavering resolve.

It’s a pleasure to be with you again and I will give the floor to my dear colleague Li.

Li Junhua, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs:

As the Secretary-General noted, we stand at a very defining moment. This Report of 2025 serves as both our compass and call to action, providing the critical evidence needed to guide discussions at the HLPF and beyond.

The data reveals in the Report a story of remarkable progress alongside turbulent challenges. Over the past decade, we have seen the following tangible victories:

New HIV infections have decreased by nearly 40 per cent since 2010.

Malaria prevention efforts have saved more than 12 million lives since 2000.

[54] countries have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease.

An additional 110 million children have enrolled in school since 2015.

Access to electricity has reached 92 per cent of the global population, with 45 countries achieving universal electricity access in the past decade.

Internet use has increased by 70 per cent — reaching 68 per cent today globally.

These are not mere statistics; they are the stories of lives transformed — more children in school, more families protected and more communities empowered.

However, the Report also lays bare a harsh reality: a challenging global context is stalling progress. Conflicts are escalating, temperatures are breaking records and debt burdens are rising, while developing countries face an annual $4 trillion SDG financing gap.

The world is not moving fast enough to achieve the SDGs amid overlapping crises. Just to share some sobering facts from the Report:

Over 800 million people remain trapped in extreme poverty.

Billions of people lack access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene.

Women continue to devote 2.5 times as many hours to unpaid domestic and care work as men.

Climate change is accelerating, with 2024 marking the hottest year on record at 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels.

Low- and middle-income countries faced record-high debt servicing costs of $1.4 trillion in 2023.

Despite these monumental challenges, the path forward is clear. In the Report, it shows that progress is possible if we scale up solutions and build on hard-won gains. We must focus our efforts on six key transitions that represent our most promising levers for systemic change. Recent global events such as UNOC3 and FFD4 have demonstrated a renewed spirit and commitment to collective action. Let us seize this moment to recommit, to act decisively and deliver on our promise.

Thank you.

**Questions and Answers

Spokesman: Edie, please.

Question: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General, on behalf of the United Nations Correspondence Association for doing this briefing. As you well know, my name is Edith Lederer from the Associated Press. You said that there had been progress on 35 per cent of the SDG targets, but which, if any, of the 17 SDG Goals are on target to be achieved by 2030? And if I may, what is your reaction to President Trump saying just an hour or two ago that if there is no peace deal in Ukraine in the next 50 days, he will impose biting sanctions on Russia. And I think we also would all like to know what, if any, role the UN is being asked to play if there is a new ceasefire in Gaza?

Thank you.

Secretary-General: There are many different questions. [laughing] First, there are only 35 per cent of the Goals that are on target. But that means that 35 per cent of the Goals are on target, and some are extremely important. Extreme poverty has reduced. Child mortality and women’s mortality have dramatically reduced, and the access of girls to education and, in general, the access to education has substantially increased. So, if there were no Sustainable Development Goals, many of these achievements would never have been reached, because the Sustainable Development Goals have created a framework in which Governments and other entities could be united to deliver on some of the key priorities of development in today’s world. So, the Sustainable Development Goals are a success already because at least one third of them are achieving the results that were determined.

Now, but why is it not the same everywhere? Where are the obstacles? Let’s be clear. There is something fundamentally wrong in the structure of the economic and financial architecture and in the way it operates to the detriment of developing countries. And this has nothing to do with the Sustainable Development Goals. The Sustainable Development Goals are objectives to improve the living conditions of everybody. The problem is that the Sustainable Development Goals do not include the instruments that would be necessary to make them happen. And that is why we have been strongly insisting for the need to deep reforms in the international financial architecture, and I would say, in the rules of the global economy, in order to make sure that it is possible for countries that are drowning in debt, for countries that have no access to concessional funding, for countries that are marginalized in international trade. We need those reforms to create the conditions for those countries to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.

So, I think that the discussion is not whether or not we have reached enough. The discussion is what are the roots in the injustices and inequalities of our global economic and financial system that make it so difficult to implement things that everybody will recognize are the things that are needed for us to live with dignity.

The second question that you have asked is about the sanctions. I would say that what we absolutely need is to have an immediate ceasefire and to have an immediate ceasefire paving the way for a political solution and the political solution based on the Charter, on international law and on the different resolutions of the bodies of the UN. Whatever can contribute to these objectives will, of course, be important if it is done in line with international law.

Question: And on Gaza…

Secretary-General: Gaza is horrific. We all condemned the horrible, terrible, attacks of Hamas, but what we are witnessing in Gaza is a level of death and destruction that has no parallel in recent times. And it is something that undermines, I would say, undermines the most basic conditions of human dignity for the population of Gaza, independently of the enormous suffering that they are having.

We absolutely need a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. And I hope that the parties are able to overcome, both parties are able to overcome the difficulties that they still find for that ceasefire to take place. But the ceasefire is not enough. It is essential that that ceasefire leads to a solution, and that solution can only be possible if both Palestinians and Israelis can have a State where they can exercise their rights. The idea, and that is why we are going to have in July, one conference on the two-State solution, the idea that it would be possible to have 5 million people inside a country, in their own lands, without any rights is something that is totally against humanity and totally against international law.

Spokesman: Sherwin Bryce-Pease.

Question: Secretary-General, Sherwin Bryce-Pease, South African Broadcasting. What is your estimation, sir, of the impact of the decisions by the United States in recent months to withdraw from various development-related initiatives, including climate finance and the recent financing for development conference that you referred to in Sevilla. Its rejection, also, of increased lending by development banks in particular, essentially pushing back at the reforms you are seeking to achieve in terms of the restructuring of the global financial institutions? How are you going to fill the gaps that are going to be left by the United States’ withdrawal from these initiatives?

Thank you.

Secretary-General: The problem is not the presence or not presence in international meetings. The question is that, obviously, we need in an international economic and financial system that is fundamentally wrong and unfair, we need reforms. And to put obstacles to those reforms is indeed something that is extremely negative. And I hope that the countries that lead the global economy, the G7 countries, understand that it is better to lead the reforms of a system today than to wait and one day suffer the reforms of the system that will become inevitable.

Spokesman: Dezhi?

Question: Secretary-General, Xu Dezhi, China Central Television. A similar question with Sherwin. We know that Trump Administration now reversed multiple policies, it’s not only just the international financial institution. It’s also about the clean energy policy. It’s about its tariffs to bring instability of the world economy. How much impact would that be to the SDGs? And given the fact this is only the first year of this Administration, you will have four years, how would, how should other countries to do to achieve the SDGs?

Thank you.

Secretary-General: Well first of all, about clean energy, I think that independently of the will of the Government of any country and in particular, the United States, we are witnessing irreversible movements towards the hegemonic role of renewables. This is moving at a speed that nobody could forecast just a few months ago. And the truth is that even in the United States, you have a number of states that are moving forward very strongly, and you have the private sector that makes their accounts and sees where profits are. And today, the cheapest energy is renewable. And so, you are not intelligent if you invest in more expensive forms of energy or if you invest in things that will be stranded in the near future. So, I am pretty confident that the realities of the global economy will make any attempt to slow down the process ineffective. And I’m optimistic about the capacity of renewable energy to very quickly assume a leading role in the global economy.

About trade, it is clear that any trade war is something in which nobody wins. Everybody loses. And so, I strongly believe that it is absolutely essential to avoid trade wars. And we don’t know yet what is going to happen. Many things are changing every day, but I hope we come to the end of this with a rational global trade system.

Spokesman: Thank you, Pam, and then we’ll have to go.

Question: Thank you very much for a somewhat grim Report, but an optimistic view of it. Pamela Falk from US News and World Report. So, a big picture question. The Pew Charitable Trust, other organizations, look at the UN and favourability around the world. And although it’s still positive, it’s trending downward. What can you do, particularly since global goals like nutrition that overlaps two SDGs, people at the N4D [Nutrition for Development] is looking for private sector funds, clusters of countries. Is that the new multilateralism? And what can you do to bring up the favourability of the UN?

Thank you.

Secretary-General: What we are witnessing in the world today is a progressive trend for a multipolar world. You see the emerging economies growing at a faster rate than developed countries. We can talk about China, but we can talk about India, we can talk about Indonesia, we can talk about so many other countries. So, the global economic relations are changing, and we see a trend more and more for these different entities to network. And in that networking, multipolarity will tend to strengthen multilateralism. So, I’m very optimistic about the future of multilateralism because I’m seeing that every single day, there is a bit more equilibrium in international relations. Every single day, we move a little bit more to multipolarity. And at every single day, we are heading into a direction that, because multipolarity by itself requires multilateralism, we are heading into a direction in which the present trends and the present attacks and the present, I would say, forms of undermining multilateralism, will inevitably fail.",https://press.un.org/themes/custom/un3_press/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-15 06:03:53.033075

Nano One selected for launch of ALTA, America’s first lithium and battery supply chain accelerator.

Only OBBB-ready solution for LFP-linking upstream critical minerals to downstream cell manufacturing.

Eliminates chokepoints and reliance on foreign-controlled processes, inputs and wasteful ecosystems.

Nano One® Materials Corp. (“Nano One” or the “Company”), a process technology company specializing in lithium-ion battery cathode active materials (CAM), has been selected to join the Arkansas Lithium Technology Accelerator (ALTA), America’s first lithium and battery supply chain accelerator, to help catalyze a durable, domestic battery materials ecosystem and reduce foreign dependency on critical technology and inputs.

“Participating in ALTA positions Nano One as a strategic contributor to lithium-ion battery supply chain independence,” said Dan Blondal, CEO of Nano One. “We are the only OBBB-ready solution for LFP-linking upstream mineral extraction to downstream cell manufacturing. Without localized cathode production in the supply chain, critical minerals risk being sent offshore for processing or worse yet, idled while U.S. battery plants source elsewhere. Our One-Pot™ process eliminates chokepoints and reliance on foreign-controlled inputs, processing technologies, wastewater and byproducts that will not scale here. Purpose-built for North America, it vertically integrates PCAM with CAM-cutting costs, reducing permitting barriers, and unlocking a scalable, modular platform at the core of the lithium-ion battery ecosystem.”

Image: Simplified Lithium-ion battery supply chain.

This milestone reinforces Nano One’s position as a national strategic asset in lithium-ion battery production- fortifying a secure, localized supply chain for defense and commercial markets. It also highlights Nano One’s continued relevance to energy growth and national security, bolstered by recent funding of US$12.9 million from the U.S. Department of Defense. Nano One’s Candiac facility, in Québec, is scaling operations towards initial sales for defense and energy storage, while supporting licensing and joint venture efforts to address high-volume markets for AI data centers and electric vehicles. Arkansas’ bold yet achievable supply chain goals align with Nano One’s multi-jurisdictional strategy, leveraging Candiac as a hub, accelerator and launchpad for validation, commercialization, and large-scale growth in the US, Canada and beyond. These efforts are anchored by Nano One’s Innovation Centre in Burnaby, which supports process development, scale-up, regional deployment, and long-term competitiveness.

“We’re thrilled to have Nano One join the ALTA program. Their One-Pot LFP technology represents the kind of breakthrough innovation that supports the national goal of reshoring supply chains. It’s a strong fit for Arkansas’ rapidly growing lithium ecosystem,” said Arthur Orduña, executive director of The Venture Center. Nano One is one of only three companies selected for ALTA’s inaugural cohort, alongside innovators in lithium processing and geothermal deployment. The accelerator is backed by Standard Lithium, the Walton Family Foundation, and a network of Arkansas-based producers, academic institutions, and government partners. Participation in ALTA creates opportunities for partnerships and strategic visibility in the U.S., while enabling shared learnings with other innovative North American supply chain leaders of tomorrow and established players looking to support localization of the lithium-ion battery supply chain.

To capitalize on this momentum, Nano One began trading on the U.S. OTCQB under the ticker NNOMF on July 14, enhancing visibility and accessibility to U.S. investors as it expands commercial efforts and builds partnerships across North America. Momentum is further supported by policy shifts like the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), which proposes tighter domestic content requirements and phases out incentives tied to foreign inputs. With CAM representing the highest cost component in a cell, Nano One’s One-Pot™ process provides a path to resilient, cost competitive, and fully domestic manufacturing.

David McCormick of Pennsylvania will jointly announce roughly $70 billion of energy investments in the state Tuesday as the president travels to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda.

The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit will be held at Carnegie Mellon University, and it comes as the state’s political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy.

Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal industry that the Republican administration has taken several steps to bolster.

Neither the White House nor McCormick’s office gave breakdowns of the $70 billion or what the investments entail.

McCormick, a Republican first-term senator who is organizing the inaugural event, says the summit is meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. He says the investments will spur tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania.

“Pennsylvania is uniquely positioned because of abundant energy, of incredible skilled workers, technology,” McCormick said in a Fox News interview Monday promoting the summit. “We need to win the battle for AI innovation in America, and Pennsylvania is at the center of it.”

The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will also attend.

Administration officials speaking at the summit include White House crypto czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

In the Fox News interview, McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank.

Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “ AI Avenue ” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir.

Pennsylvania has scored several big investment wins in recent months, some of it driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business.

Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants.

Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, with more to come, while a one-time coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers.

Shapiro, elected in 2022, has been pushing for the state to land a big multibillion-dollar industrial project, like a semiconductor factory or an electric vehicle plant.

In his first budget speech, Shapiro — who is viewed as a potential White House contender in 2028 — told lawmakers that Pennsylvania needs to “get in the game” and warned that it would take money.

He didn’t land a mega project, but he instead has worked to play up big investments by Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Nippon Steel, as he prepares to seek a second term.

The head of Lucid Group warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will drive up costs to build automobiles — even in the U.S.

The industry’s global supply chain means domestic manufacturers still have to import raw materials and some parts from other countries, interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on July 14.

“For the American consumers, vehicles are going to be more expensive under the tariff regime. There’s no other way around it,” Winterhoff said. “There’s a reason the supply chain is so global.”

The Newark, Calif.-based manufacturer of electric vehicles is looking for ways to reduce costs by localizing more of its supply chain, in particular the raw materials for lithium-ion batteries. Lucid signed a deal in June with Graphite One to boost its supply of U.S.-processed graphite, a key battery component.

Lucid has partnered with Japanese electronic maker Panasonic Holdings Corp. since 2022 to supply its batteries, including 2170 cells, which are commonly used in EVs. The economics of that partnership made sense pre-tariffs, Winterhoff said, because of advanced manufacturing production credits that helped defray costs.

Now, the automaker is working with Panasonic to find ways to source more of the cell supply’s raw materials in the U.S., Winterhoff said from Panasonic’s newest U.S. battery plant in De Soto, Kan. However, Lucid will not use cells made in the new facility in vehicles until next year.

“I still have to say, and I hope Panasonic hears that, there is some room for improvement,” Winterhoff said, “but also right now with the tariffs, this is a very good move for us.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-07/Lucid-1200_0.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 07:08:46.054491

California became the world’s largest economy to power itself with two-thirds clean energy in 2023, Governor Gavin Newsom announced Monday, marking a historic shift as the state leans heavily on renewable sources.

Data released by the state shows 67% of retail electricity sales last year came from solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, and biomass, up from 61% in 2022 and 41% a decade ago.

The milestone, highlighted three years into Newsom’s tenure, comes as the state added a record 7,000 megawatts of clean capacity to the grid in 2024, surpassing previous highs set in 2022 and 2023, according to the Governor’s office. This year, clean energy has powered the state for an average of seven hours daily, with over 90% of days seeing 100% clean electricity for part of the time, equating to 51.9 days so far—nearly 30% of 2025.

Since 2019, 25,000 megawatts of new energy, mostly solar and battery storage, have been integrated, aligning with a 2023 roadmap targeting 148,000 megawatts by 2045. California’s battery storage capacity has surged 1,944% since 2019, reaching 15,000 megawatts, storing excess solar power for evening use. Solar alone accounts for over 21,000 megawatts, with a recent peak of 21,500 megawatts in May.

The shift has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% since 2000, despite a 78% GDP rise, with power sector emissions halving since 2009.

ZM Trucks unveils new battery-electric terminal tractor for North American market

ZM Trucks North America has officially unveiled its T75 Battery-Electric Terminal Tractor, a zero-emission, heavy-duty vehicle purpose-built for America's ports, warehouses, and distribution yards.

The truck made its debut on the show floor at the 2025 Port Electrification Conference, drawing strong interest from fleet operators and sustainability leaders, the company said.

Designed from the ground up as an all-electric platform, not a diesel retrofit, the T75 combines industrial-strength performance with clean energy technology to meet the real-world demands of high-volume yard operations.

With a 75-mile operational range, a GCWR of 165,350 pounds, and an 80,000-pound fifth wheel lifting capacity, the T75 is built for all-day work. Its dual-gun DC fast charging system enables recharging from 20% to 80% in as little as 42 minutes, delivering uptime comparable to diesel trucks while operating much more quietly, the company noted. That quiet operation not only reduces noise pollution but also contributes to higher driver satisfaction and retention, especially during long shifts.

""This isn't just a diesel truck with a battery pack,"" said Joost de Vries, CEO of ZM Trucks. ""The T75 was engineered from scratch to be electric, rugged enough for long shifts, smart enough for modern fleet management, and clean enough to meet today's zero-emission goals.""

The T75 delivers 415 peak horsepower and up to 2,802 lb-ft of torque, providing the strength needed for demanding yard operations. It's built with a complete ABS air brake system, LED exterior lighting, and halogen headlights to support safety in all conditions.

Inside the cab, operators benefit from a comprehensive HVAC system, a 10-inch LCD dash, 360-degree cameras, and ergonomic controls designed for comfort during extended shifts.

The tractor's heavy-duty engineering includes a proven chassis platform with optional central lubrication. For off-road duties like dump truck work, an optional hydraulic package to power trailers can be added. Additionally, the T75 is fleet-ready, featuring a comprehensive telematics package and a robust electrical system that supports high-duty cycles with ease.

The T75 is now in full production and available for order in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Lighting issue prompts recall of 56K Kenworth, Peterbilt trucks

More than 56,000 Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks have been recalled because of a lights-related issue.

According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration documents, the tail brake light, upper and lower beam headlights, reverse light, and turn signal lamps may not illuminate as intended. Additionally, the lift axles, if lowered, may revert to a raised position, or oscillate up and down when the signal warning lights are activated.

As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, ""Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment.""

The 56,575 affected trucks include:

2023-’26 Kenworth T380

2023-’26 Kenworth T680

2023-’26 Kenworth T880

2023-’26 Peterbilt 520

2023-’26 Peterbilt 548

2023-’26 Peterbilt 579

2025 Kenworth T180

2025 Peterbilt 535

2025-’26 Kenworth T280

2025-’26 Kenworth L770

According to the recall, delayed and unsteady headlights can result in insufficient illumination of the road, decreasing the driver's visibility and increasing the risk of a crash. In addition, an unexpected position change of the lift axles may increase the risk of injury.

Dealers will update the Vehicle Control Unit software, free of charge. Paccar has not yet provided a schedule for recall notification. Owners can contact Kenworth's customer service at 1-425-828-5888 and Peterbilt's customer service at 1-940-591-4220 with recall number 25PACF. NHTSA’s recall number is 25V-436.

Hours of service waiver issued in New Mexico for flood responders

Deadly flooding in the village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, has prompted an emergency declaration from New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The governor’s declaration calls for regulatory relief for truck drivers providing direct assistance to the emergency in Ruidoso, New Mexico, and Lincoln County.

Under terms of the declaration, truck drivers responding to the emergency are exempt from 49 Code of Federal Regulations 395.3 -- Maximum driving time for property-carrying vehicles. The declaration also waives 395.5 for passenger-carrying vehicles.

“Ruidoso endured devastating wildfires and flooding last summer, and now catastrophic flooding is hitting this resilient community again,” Gov. Lujan Grisham said. “This crisis demands immediate action.”

The order is effective for the duration of the emergency or through 2 p.m. on July 31, whichever is sooner.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/07/screenshot-2025-07-14-at-114839-am.WPVJTqKCN3.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-07-15 04:01:11.383239

As countries increasingly seek to diversify supply chains in response to these shifting dynamics, MENA countries have a growing opportunity to localise clean energy value chains.
Building domestic capacity to manufacture, assemble, and innovate clean energy technologies would allow the region to insulate itself from external shocks.","Since taking office in January 2025, US President Donald Trump has implemented several tariff policies marked by unpredictability, including abrupt announcements and frequent shifts that have unsettled global markets. This has repeatedly disrupted trade flows and deepened concerns over the resilience of global supply chains.

As trade and geopolitical tensions continue to heighten, policymakers and businesses are shifting from cost-driven to resilience-focused supply chain strategies, which emphasise de-risking, near-shoring, and re-engineering. This is especially true in the clean energy sector, where global supply chains are heavily concentrated in China and increasingly seen as a vulnerability.

For the MENA region, particularly capital-rich Gulf states, this presents a strategic opening to accelerate efforts to localise clean energy manufacturing. Doing so would reduce exposure to external shocks and price volatility, as well as create high-quality jobs and support broader sustainable growth goals.

Vulnerability to Resilience

The recent and continued tariff uncertainty follows the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and maritime disruptions in the Red Sea, further highlighting the fragility of the clean energy trade system. Disruptions to energy markets, manufacturing, and logistics have negatively impacted supply chains, raising prices and causing significant delays to the flow of critical components such as solar photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines, and batteries.

From 2020-22, solar panel prices spiked by 14–20% due to shortages of raw materials and shipping delays. As countries increasingly seek to diversify supply chains in response to these shifting dynamics, MENA countries have a growing opportunity to localise clean energy value chains.

The region remains heavily reliant on imports from China, which holds around 70% of the regional market for solar PV panels and cells, and electric vehicles. Building domestic capacity to manufacture, assemble, and innovate clean energy technologies would allow the region to insulate itself from external shocks.

The GCC countries have both the capital (financial and human) and the connectivity through advanced logistics and favourable geographic positioning, meaning they are well-positioned to lead the region in transitioning from consumer to producer of clean energy components.

Capital and Connectivity

Investments in rail, logistics, and ports—including Yanbu in Saudi Arabia and Jebel Ali in the UAE—have firmly established the Gulf as a global trade hub. In 2024, ten ports across Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar ranked among the world’s top 70. The GCC’s freight and logistics market is currently valued at around $81bn but projected to grow to around $110bn by 2030.

On the capital front, GCC sovereign wealth funds collectively manage around $4.3tn and governments are channelling this into diversification and localisation strategies, with Saudi Arabia committing $30bn to its localising its energy. This includes industrial zones, innovation hubs, and manufacturing facilities for solar PV modules, wind turbine components, battery storage, and grid technologies.",https://static.majalla.com/styles/780_scale/public/2025-07/192157.jpeg?VersionId=oI0NZKpZtssdFa4qefqdPRVXrnJy_CkW,N,,2025-07-15 08:03:53.947632

The Ultium Cells facility in Spring Hill, TN — a joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solution — will begin production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells by late 2027, complementing its current output of nickel cobalt manganese aluminum (NCMA) pouch cells. This move builds on a $2.3 billion investment first announced in 2021.

“LFP was an American breakthrough that’s grown in popularity as a low-cost battery solution worldwide. I’m proud that we’re bringing its benefits — and associated jobs — back to America,” said Mark Reuss, president of GM.

With the Spring Hill plant designated as GM’s hub for LFP batteries, the company is also working to finalize a production site for lithium manganese rich (LMR) battery cells. GM aims to be the first automaker to produce LMR prismatic cells at commercial scale, which the company says is key to delivering the best mix of range, performance and affordability for EV customers.

These developments are part of GM’s strategy to support a broad range of EV models, from full-size pickups to affordable electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt, by leveraging a mix of NCMA, LFP and LMR battery technologies.

Meanwhile, GM is also expanding its battery development infrastructure. The company recently completed the steel frame of its new 500,000-square-foot Ancker-Johnson Battery Cell Development Center in Warren, MI, part of a $900 million investment at its Global Technical Center. Together with the adjacent Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, the new facility is expected to reduce development times for new batteries by up to a year.

The Ancker-Johnson Center’s first priority will be advancing LMR cells toward production, using cutting-edge tools to validate concepts and streamline the path to manufacturing. The center will support GM’s goals of reducing battery cost, improving range and speeding up charging — key factors in expanding EV adoption.

“From securing the supply chain to advancing new chemistries and cell form factors to investing in state-of-the-art facilities,” Reuss said, “every step we’ve taken is designed to build a robust, diverse America-driven EV portfolio.”

GM also emphasized its broader commitment to a U.S.-based supply chain, highlighting recent moves to secure domestic sources of lithium and magnets to support long-term growth. With multiple battery chemistries, vertically integrated facilities and rapid development pipelines, GM says it is well-positioned to lead the industry in the transition to electric mobility.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2025/Ultium_Cells_web_full.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 03:04:05.409073

Coal remains the backbone of supply, accounting for nearly 73% (157.6GW) of the total daily generation, the report states.

As of FY2024, the industrial, commercial, residential, and agricultural sectors accounted for approximately 32%, 10%, 31%, and 22% of India’s total electricity sales, respectively.

“While still modest in scale, electric vehicles (EVs) are beginning to contribute to electricity demand. Electricity consumption by EVs has grown nearly tenfold – from 59 million units (MUs) in FY2021 to 569MUs in FY2024,” says Charith Konda, contributing author and Energy Specialist at IEEFA, South Asia.

IEEFA’s analysis shows that the alignment of peak demand with solar availability presents an opportunity to maximise solar utilisation, making it possible to tap into the cheapest available renewable energy source, reduce daytime reliance on coal, and cut emissions.

“The persistent evening peaks, which now nearly match daytime highs, reinforce the urgency of deploying storage solutions, demand measures and hybrid renewable projects to meet post-sunset demand,” says Saloni Sachdeva Michael, co-author and Energy Specialist at IEEFA, South Asia. The sharp rise in demand after sunset strains the grid and drives up market prices.

“Incentivising load shifting from evening to day, especially among industrial and commercial consumers, can help align demand with abundant solar generation. To support this, Time of Day tariffs should be made more effective by significantly widening the price differential between peak and off-peak periods,” suggests Vibhuti Garg, contributing author and Director, IEEFA, South Asia.

The authors advocate the use of energy-efficient appliances such as ACs, lights, and industrial motors. Zero-interest financing can ease the upfront costs of these appliances, making them affordable for households and small businesses. Additionally, the government can consider reducing the goods and services tax (GST) on 5-star rated appliances.

“Accelerating the use of battery energy storage systems can ensure grid stability and reduce the need for fast-ramping coal. Battery storage also enables energy arbitrage by charging during near-zero-cost solar hours and discharging during high-demand hours, making it a critical tool for meeting peak demand efficiently. To reduce the cost of energy storage, the government must fast-track PLI disbursals and rationalise import duties until domestic manufacturing scales up,” says co-author Kaira Rakheja, Energy Analyst, IEEFA, South Asia.

Hybrid projects that combine complementary generation patterns of solar (daytime), wind (evening and night), and hydro (dispatchable as needed) also make for a diversified and flexible energy mix. When paired with battery storage, these hybrids can store surplus energy and release it during peak demand hours, particularly in the evening.

However, the note highlights that the deployment of such projects is limited at present due to land aggregation issues, lack of coordinated transmission planning, and high cost of storage components. To address these bottlenecks, the government can consider streamlining land and grid access for hybrid clusters, revise power purchase agreements to value firm and dispatchable output and provide clarity on compensation for storage-based services.

“Prioritising the adoption of advanced digital tools to improve demand forecasting, grid planning, and operational efficiency is also essential,” notes Garg.

“Ultimately, addressing India’s rising electricity demand will require a strategic overhaul of how we generate, store, and consume electricity. By prioritising storage deployment along with hybrid projects, and leveraging demand flexibility and digital tools, India can not only meet its rising electricity demand peaks but also build a power system that is cleaner, more cost-effective, and climate resilient,” Sachdeva emphasises.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/battery%20energy%20storage_0.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 06:04:13.500769

The new materials use the concept of radiative cooling, which keeps objects cool by dumping the excess heat into outer space rather than the atmosphere.

Yuebing Zheng, a mechanical engineering professor who worked on the July 2 study, said the new materials can reflect sunlight and convert its emitted heat into a type of light that can be released into outer space rather than how air conditioning dumps heat into the atmosphere. According to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration, air conditioning accounted for 28% of Texas’s total electricity consumption in 2020.

The researchers used a machine learning framework to decide what the new materials are made of and their structure on a nanoscale. Zheng said machine learning opens doors that previous trial-and-error approaches could not.

“Using machine learning, we are able to actually explore so many different (geometries) at the micro-nanoscale: the shape of this micro-nanoscale architecture, the size, the arrangement, as well as the materials,” Zheng said.

The study was a collaboration between the University of Texas, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, National University of Singapore and Umea University in Sweden. Kan Yao, a co-author of the study and research fellow at UT, said the study was originally proposed by researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. They approached UT partly because of its experience with using machine learning in the design of photonic materials.

“It’s not a debate, but (a) discussion in our community,” Yao said. “Whether machine learning is (an) effective or efficient method (because), this time, we (proved it is) useful in finding new materials for radiative cooling. On the other hand, some other people would say when you make this algorithm work, you need a lot of data. Does that deserve it?”

Yao said there are other barriers to bringing this technology to mass production, like reducing the price of the material and improving its aesthetics without hurting its thermal properties. However, Zheng is hopeful for the future of UT’s involvement in this area.

“We have (a) very strong foundation for larger-scale nanomanufacturing at UT Austin,” Zheng said. “We are looking for collaboration as well as investment (and) government funding to push this.”",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07-14-25_AIEnergyMaterials_JulianaBrandao.png,N,,2025-07-15 03:03:53.612951

This surge emphasises the need to accelerate the delivery of clean electricity, bioenergy, hydrogen, and energy storage solutions. A clean future in Great Britain also requires empowering homes and businesses to embrace low-carbon heating and adopt energy efficiency measures as part of everyday life.

'Pathways to Net Zero

FES 2025 presents three potential pathways to achieve net zero, each varying in its reliance on electrification, hydrogen, bioenergy, and consumer engagement. A common thread among these pathways is the significant reduction in annual emissions, potentially halving to around 200 megatonnes of CO2 a year within the next decade and further shrinking to 100 megatonnes of CO2 by 2040 with the right infrastructure in place.

The changing role of renewables

Britain's energy infrastructure undergoing a huge transformation, with wind and solar expected to increase grid capacity by up to 98% by 2050. Hydrogen will play a pivotal role, powering the network with between 98 and 325 TWh by the middle of the century. We also believe electric vehicles (EVs) will become the largest source of flexibility, providing 51 GW at peak, which is more than gas fired generation provides today.

How do we get to net zero?

Great Britain's net zero journey has four key waves. Having laid the initial foundation, the focus now shifts to the second wave: scaling up markets by 2030 to integrate new low-carbon technologies to deliver clean power. Success in this phase will pave the way for the third and fourth waves, leading to growth and completion by 2050.

Fintan Slye, Chief Executive of NESO:

""Over the past year, we have run the electricity system at 95% zero-carbon for the first time and phased out coal entirely from our energy system. But this isn't enough. We need to go further and faster, accelerating the roll-out of clean energy technologies is imperative to help deliver a clean and affordable energy system in the long-term.

""The choices made today will shape the success of each wave of Britain's transition. That means speeding up the adoption of energy efficiency measures, empowering households and businesses to make informed choices on things like demand flexibility, purchasing an electric car and switching to low-carbon heating.""

Strategic measures for success

FES 2025 highlights several crucial measures to ensure a secure and affordable transition to net zero:

Rapid development of infrastructure for electricity, gas, hydrogen, and carbon capture.

Promotion of energy efficiency measures, innovative tariffs, and demand flexibility to save money for consumers.

Incentives for the industrial sector to switch to low-carbon fuels and embrace carbon capture and storage (CCS).

In a written response submitted to the National Assembly ahead of his confirmation hearing this week, Kim emphasized the need for aggressive government support that matches policies implemented by competing nations.

“It is time for strategic and proactive government-led industrial policies, including incentives that do not fall behind those of competing nations, in order to minimize trade risks,” Kim stated.

He noted that while semiconductors remained a core pillar of Korea’s industrial and economic security, the country’s leadership in memory chips is being challenged by Chinese and US firms, and its capabilities in logic chips remain relatively weak.

“We need bold semiconductor policies to strengthen our global leadership and stabilize our domestic manufacturing base,” Kim said, adding that tax and fiscal support for the sector will be expanded.

Addressing the battery sector, Kim acknowledged current difficulties stemming from a temporary slowdown in electric vehicle demand and the rapid rise of Chinese competitors. He said the government would consider introducing production tax credits for key minerals and materials to expand incentives for domestic manufacturing and strengthen the battery supply chain.

Kim’s vision for production tax credits involves a system that offers tax deductions based on production volume, effectively functioning as subsidies linked to output. The US has implemented similar “Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits” under the IRA to support strategic industries such as batteries, solar panels and clean fuels.

In Korea, companies operating in sectors designated as national strategic technologies, such as semiconductors and batteries, are currently eligible for one-time tax credits of up to 25 percent for facility and research and development investments. Unlike these investment-based incentives, Kim’s proposed scheme would serve as a more direct benefit by offering tax credits on a portion of production costs.

If implemented, leading chipmakers Samsung Electronics and SK hynix are projected to receive annual tax reductions of between 4 trillion won and 5 trillion won ($2.9 billion and $3.6 billion).

President Lee had also pledged during his campaign to push for production tax credits of up to 10 percent for semiconductors. After taking office, he reportedly expanded the plan to include the battery sector, initiating internal reviews.

In his statement, Kim also vowed to expand the government budget for renewable energy.

“Expanding renewable energy is an urgent task for achieving carbon neutrality, enhancing energy security and creating new growth drivers,” he said, pledging to improve the overall environment for renewable energy deployment including identifying new project sites, securing grid connectivity and increasing public acceptance.

At the same time, Kim expressed support for nuclear energy, stressing the importance of a balanced energy mix of carbon-free sources to ensure a stable power supply and meet South Korea’s greenhouse gas reduction targets under the Nationally Determined Contribution framework.

He also pledged to boost Korea’s long-term technological competitiveness by developing Korean-style small modular reactors and next-generation nuclear fuels, while expanding exports of nuclear equipment and supporting small and mid-sized exporters in the sector.

On the issue of extended tariff negotiations with the US, set to conclude by Aug. 1, Kim said he would work toward a mutually beneficial outcome and use the talks as an opportunity to develop a bilateral manufacturing cooperation road map.

“In the face of US tariff measures and global supply chain shifts, I will do my utmost as Korea’s ‘export frontrunner’ to strengthen our export competitiveness in key industries and open up new markets,” he said.

Kim, a former official at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, most recently served as head of marketing at Doosan Enerbility, a major power equipment builder. Since his nomination, he has divested all holdings in companies that could present potential conflicts of interest, including shares in Doosan.

Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal industry that the Republican administration has taken several steps to bolster.

He says the investments will spur tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania.

“Pennsylvania is uniquely positioned because of abundant energy, of incredible skilled workers, technology,” McCormick said in a Fox News interview Monday promoting the summit. “We need to win the battle for AI innovation in America, and Pennsylvania is at the center of it.”

The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will also attend.

Administration officials speaking at the summit include White House crypto czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

In the Fox News interview, McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank.

Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “ AI Avenue ” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir.

Pennsylvania has scored several big investment wins in recent months, some of it driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business.

Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants.

Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, with more to come, while a one-time coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers.

Shapiro, elected in 2022, has been pushing for the state to land a big multibillion-dollar industrial project, like a semiconductor factory or an electric vehicle plant.

In his first budget speech, Shapiro — who is viewed as a potential White House contender in 2028 — told lawmakers that Pennsylvania needs to “get in the game” and warned that it would take money.

He didn’t land a mega project, but he instead has worked to play up big investments by Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Nippon Steel, as he prepares to seek a second term.

Conclusion: The U.S. Is the New Supply Chain Battlefield Asia's automakers are rewriting the rules of the EV game.","The electric vehicle (EV) race is no longer just about technology—it's a geopolitical chess match where Asian automakers are making bold bets on U.S. manufacturing to navigate trade wars and secure Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies. Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai are pouring billions into U.S. EV production, signaling that near-shoring and compliance with American policies now outweigh the risks of tariffs. For investors, this strategic pivot creates a clear roadmap for profit: prioritize automakers and their supply chains that are deeply embedded in U.S. manufacturing, as their resilience to trade friction positions them to dominate post-IRA markets.

The Geopolitical Calculus: Tariffs vs. Subsidies

The U.S. automotive market is ground zero for a clash between protectionism and green incentives. While tariffs on imported vehicles and components threaten profit margins, the IRA's $7,500 tax credits for EVs made in North America—and with locally sourced batteries—act as a powerful carrot. Asian automakers are taking the bait.

Take Toyota, which has invested $13 billion since 2020 to expand U.S. EV production. Its North Carolina battery plant (see image below), supplying both Toyota and Honda, is a masterstroke:

By 2027, this facility will produce 30 GWh of batteries annually—enough to power 300,000 fully electric vehicles. This localization not only avoids tariffs but ensures eligibility for IRA subsidies, turning trade barriers into competitive advantages.

While Tesla's stock has dipped amid global overcapacity fears, Toyota's shares have held steady, reflecting investor confidence in its diversified supply chain and U.S. pivot.

Honda's Cross-Border Gambit: Canada as a Tariff-Free Bridge

Honda's $15 billion investment in Ontario, Canada, highlights its strategy to straddle U.S. demand and NAFTA compliance. Its Canadian plants will produce EVs and batteries, with final assembly in the U.S. avoiding tariffs—a textbook example of supply chain resilience.

But the real win is its partnership with LG Energy Solution: their $4.4B Ohio battery plant (part of the “Honda EV Hub”) will begin production by late 2024. This joint venture not only secures battery IP but also guarantees access to IRA subsidies, offsetting the cost of U.S. tariffs.

Honda's 2025 target of 240,000 EVs annually—up from near-zero today—underscores its urgency to scale before competitors.

Hyundai's Bold Bet on Steel and Supply Chain Control

Hyundai's $21 billion U.S. investment, including a Louisiana steel plant, reveals its ambition to control critical EV inputs. By producing “next-gen” steel for EV bodies locally, Hyundai avoids tariffs on imported materials and insulates itself from global supply chain shocks.

CEO José Muñoz's mantra—“increasing localization is the best strategy”—is paying off. The Alabama and Georgia plants, now retooled for EVs, are set to ramp up production ahead of IRA tax credit deadlines.

By 2026, 70% of Hyundai's North American EVs will be made in the U.S., compared to just 20% in 2023. This shift positions it to claim a disproportionate share of IRA subsidies.

Why U.S.-Exposed Asian Automakers Outperform Peers

The IRA's regional content rules and U.S. tariff policies have created a clear divide: automakers with deep U.S. footprints will thrive, while those relying on Asia-centric supply chains will lag.

Battery Makers with U.S. Presence: Companies like LG Energy Solution (Honda's partner) or Samsung SDI (supplying Ford) are critical. Their U.S. factories qualify for IRA credits, making them indispensable to automakers.

EV Charging Infrastructure: Honda's stake in the IONNA charging network, with 30,000 planned stations, reduces range anxiety and locks in customer loyalty.

Meanwhile, peers like China's BYD or Japan's Nissan—still over-reliant on Asian production—face higher tariff risks and slower access to U.S. subsidies.

Investment Playbook: Buy U.S. Tethered Supply Chains

Stocks to Watch:

1. Toyota Motor (TM): Its battery plant dominance and hybrid-to-EV transition make it a safe bet.

2. Hyundai (HYMTF): Its steel plant and U.S. expansion are underappreciated growth drivers.

3. Honda (HMC): EV Hub investments and battery partnerships signal aggressive scaling.

Supply Chain Plays:

- Battery Suppliers: LG Energy Solution (LGES) and CATL's U.S. partners.

- Charging Infrastructure: IONNA partners like ChargePoint (CHPT).

Risk-Adjusted Buy Signal: With Q3 earnings approaching, look for these companies to report:

- Rising U.S. production volumes (e.g., Toyota's 2026 EV targets).

- Lower tariff exposure due to localized supply chains.

- IRA subsidy wins, boosting margins.

Conclusion: The U.S. Is the New Supply Chain Battlefield

Asia's automakers are rewriting the rules of the EV game. By doubling down on U.S. manufacturing, they're not just dodging tariffs—they're building moats against geopolitical volatility and securing a first-mover advantage in the IRA's subsidy era. For investors, this is a buy-and-hold opportunity: U.S.-exposed Asian automakers and their partners are the architects of the post-tariff, post-China EV order.

“The reality is that we are going to continue to face emergencies, especially since as we just got done with the big, ugly bill, they are clawing back those things that would have hopefully started to cool this planet down, because they don’t believe in science,” Crockett said on MSNBC’s “The Weeknight.” “The least that they could do is believe in helping American people. Unfortunately, we continue to see Republicans decide that they want to bury their constituents instead of actually doing everything that they can to make sure that they live amazing and full lives.”

More than 120 people were killed in the flash flooding with dozens reported missing.

While the legislation aims to boost fossil fuel production and reduce regulatory burdens, its abrupt elimination of renewable energy incentives and shifts in infrastructure priorities create both risks and opportunities for investors. Below is a structured analysis of how these changes could impact energy costs, vulnerable sectors, and strategic investment themes.

Underperforming Sectors: Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicles

The bill's most consequential move—terminating renewable energy tax credits and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—strikes at the core of clean energy growth. These credits had been critical for making projects like solar farms, wind installations, and electric vehicle (EV) adoption economically viable.

Without federal support, renewable energy projects will face higher upfront costs, slowing deployment and reducing investor appetite. EV manufacturers, now stripped of tax incentives for new and used vehicles, may see reduced demand, particularly in high-cost regions. States like California, which relied heavily on federal incentives to meet climate goals, could witness stalled EV adoption rates, further pressuring automakers and battery manufacturers.

States Most Vulnerable to Rising Energy Costs

The bill's impact will be uneven geographically. Coastal states (e.g., California, New York, and the Northeast) that prioritized renewables and EVs to meet environmental mandates are now at a disadvantage. Their energy grids, less diversified toward fossil fuels, may struggle to offset rising costs from diminished renewable capacity.

Midwestern and Southern states, which have robust fossil fuel infrastructure, are better positioned. However, states like Nevada (reliant on solar) or Hawaii (dependent on imported oil) could face sharp price hikes if alternative energy sources cannot fill gaps.

Opportunities in Fossil Fuels and Grid Infrastructure

The bill's push for fossil fuel development and Arctic/coastal infrastructure creates clear investment avenues.

Fossil Fuel Plays:

The legislation's streamlined permitting and reduced regulatory hurdles position coal, natural gas, and oil producers to expand output. Investors should focus on companies with low-cost reserves and access to export markets.

Companies like Peabody Energy (BTU) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) could benefit from higher demand and lower production costs.

Grid Infrastructure and Semiconductors:

While the bill's direct investments in Arctic security and the Coast Guard may seem tangential, they reflect a broader emphasis on energy-related infrastructure. Modernizing aging grids to handle increased fossil fuel reliance—and integrating new technologies like gas-fired power plants—will require significant capital.

Grid operators and utilities with exposure to transmission upgrades, such as NextEra Energy (NEE) and Dominion Energy (D), could see rising demand. Meanwhile, semiconductor firms (e.g., Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN)) benefiting from tax credits for U.S. manufacturing may indirectly support energy sector tech needs.

Investment Strategy: Position for Transition Risks

The bill's provisions highlight a stark policy reversal, favoring fossil fuels while sidelining renewables. Investors should:

- Avoid: Renewable energy equipment manufacturers (e.g., Vestas Wind Systems (VWS.CO)) and EV stocks lacking pricing power.

- Adopt: A tactical tilt toward fossil fuel equities, particularly those with export exposure or cost advantages.

- Hedge: Invest in grid infrastructure firms and semiconductors to capitalize on complementary infrastructure spending.

Conclusion

The ""Big Beautiful"" bill marks a decisive shift in energy policy, with rising costs likely for states and sectors reliant on renewables. While this creates headwinds for clean energy and EV markets, it opens doors for fossil fuel producers and infrastructure plays. Investors must navigate this landscape with a focus on transitioning portfolios toward the bill's beneficiaries while hedging against regional cost pressures. As markets digest these changes, the energy sector is poised for turbulence—and opportunity.

This client update will focus on the effect of the BBBA and the BOC Order on clean energy tax incentives. For our coverage of the general business tax provisions of the BBBA, click here.

1. Revision to the ITC and PTC

A. Rapid Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Wind and Solar

The eligibility of wind and solar projects for the ITC and PTC is being phased out rapidly. To be eligible for either credit, the wind or solar facility must either

begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA), or

be placed in service prior to January 1, 2028.

B. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Existing IRS guidance provides liberal rules for determining when construction begins for purposes of ITC and PTC phaseouts. Under the existing IRS guidance, a taxpayer can begin construction (""BOC"") by commencing physical work on the project (including certain off-site work on a component of the project) or incurring 5% of the cost of equipment for the project. Under a safe harbor in the existing IRS guidance, a project that begins construction in 2026 can be placed in service as late as December 31, 2030, or in some circumstances even later. However, unlike the beginning of construction principles applicable under the FEOC rules (discussed below), the applicable IRS guidance is not statutorily frozen as of January 1, 2025.

The BOC Order directs that ""[w]ithin 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the 'beginning of construction' are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

It seems likely that the new IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order will be more restrictive than existing IRS guidance. The scope and effective date of the new guidance is unknown.

C. Accelerated Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Other Technologies

For technologies other than wind and solar, the BBBA accelerates the phaseout of the ITC and PTC by eliminating the prong of the phaseout that was based upon the year that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall to 25% of 2022 levels. As a result, such projects that begin construction before 2034 will generally be entitled to the full ITC or PTC rate, but those rates will drop to 75% for construction begun in 2034, 50% for construction begun in 2035, and 0% thereafter. The scope of the BOC Order is limited to the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar, so it is not clear to what extent any IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order might apply to other technologies or for other purposes of the ITC or PTC (including, for example, the domestic content or energy community adders).

D. Increased Domestic Content Requirement to Qualify for ITC Adder

Under prior law, the level of domestic content required to qualify for the domestic content adder for the ITC was permanently set at 40% (or 20% for offshore wind), while the percentage required to qualify for the PTC version of the adder increased over time. Under the BBBA, property that began construction before June 16, 2025 will continue to require 40% domestic content; however, projects beginning construction in 2025 after June 16, in 2026, or in a later year must consist of 45%, 50%, or 55% U.S. components, respectively, to qualify for the domestic content adder. These required percentages are lower (20%, 27.5%, and 35%) for offshore wind facilities beginning construction before 2027, then 55% thereafter.

E. PTC Adder for Nuclear Energy Communities

The BBBA expands the energy community credit adder to apply to certain advanced nuclear facilities that claim the PTC, but not to any such facilities that claim the ITC. An ""advanced nuclear facility"" is defined as any nuclear facility for which either the reactor design was approved after December 31, 1993, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and such a design or a substantially similar one was not approved before such date, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction and issued a site-specific construction permit or combined license. To qualify for the energy community bonus credit on this basis, the advanced nuclear facility must be located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or at any time after December 31, 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power.

F. Leased Systems Formerly Eligible for Section 25D Credit for Solar Water Heating or Wind

The BBBA disallows the ITC and PTC for solar heating property and wind property that qualifies for the homeowner's credit under section 25D, as in effect prior to its repeal by the BBBA. This disallowance is limited to property that is leased to the homeowner. An earlier version of the BBBA would have extended this disallowance to leased rooftop solar systems, but that provision was not included in the bill as enacted.

G. ITC for Fuel Cells

The BBBA creates a 30% ITC specifically for qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after 2025. This credit is not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but it also does not benefit from other ITC adders. Fuel cells had previously struggled to qualify for the ITC after revisions in the IRA required property for which the credit is claimed to have an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate of no greater than zero. Under the BBBA, fuel cells qualify for the full 30% ITC regardless of technology, fuel type, or greenhouse gas emission profile.

2. Transferability (Sale) of Credits

Section 6418, allowing transfers (sales) of tax credits, has been revised to disallow the transfer of most clean energy tax credits to any entity that is a specified foreign entity (see the discussion of the FEOC rules below). This is an improvement over earlier versions of the bill that would have more broadly phased out the ability to transfer credits.

3. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

A. Phaseout of Credit for Applicable Critical Minerals

Under prior law, the section 45X manufacturing credit for applicable critical minerals had no expiration date. The BBBA adds a phaseout that starts one year later than the pre-existing phaseout for other section 45X eligible components. The full credit rate is available for applicable critical minerals sold before 2031. Applicable critical minerals sold in 2031, 2032, or 2033 will be eligible for 75%, 50%, or 25% respectively of the currently allowable credit. Applicable critical minerals sold after 2033 will not qualify for a credit.

B. New Applicable Critical Mineral Category: Metallurgical Coal

The BBBA creates a separate category of applicable critical minerals for metallurgical coal, defined as coal suitable for use in the production of steel within the meaning of guidance published by the Department of Energy. Metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030, will qualify for a credit of 2.5% of the relevant production costs.

C. Changes to Rules Regarding Other Eligible Components

The credit for production of wind energy components will not apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The phase-out for other eligible components is unchanged.

An additional requirement was added for a component to qualify for the $10 credit for battery modules. The module must be ""comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and battery harnesses, or other essential energy collection equipment.""

D. Reduced Scope of Integrated Component Rule

The BBBA modifies the rule that deems one or more eligible components to be sold to an unrelated person (as required to qualify for the credit) if such eligible components are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into another eligible component that is produced and sold to an unrelated person. Under the BBBA, the integration, incorporation, or assembly into the second eligible component must occur in the same manufacturing facility, at least 65% of the direct materials costs for the second eligible component must be for components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and the credit is unavailable if the second component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a third component. This rule applies to components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

4. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

The credit for carbon capture and sequestration was largely untouched by the BBBA and, in one respect, was significantly enhanced: the credit amount per ton of captured carbon oxide that is used in enhanced oil or gas recovery or for other commercial purposes, such as food and beverage, was increased from the current rate of $60 per ton to $85 per ton, the rate that was previously available only for carbon oxide disposed of by sequestration. This increase in the credit amount is equally available to carbon oxide captured from industrial emissions or direct air capture. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025; carbon capture projects already placed in service would not be able to claim the higher credit amounts for these uses. The requirement that construction of carbon capture projects begin before January 1, 2033, is unchanged. The FEOC rules also apply to the Section 45Q credit as covered below.

5. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The BBBA extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z to fuel sold through December 31, 2029. However, qualifying fuels produced after December 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Under prior law, there had been a question as to whether certain production processes could be considered to have a negative emissions rate for most fuels by resulting in an enhanced credit amount. The BBBA explicitly rules out application of a negative emissions rate by providing that, for purposes of determining the emissions factor, qualifying fuels may not be treated as having an emissions rate of less than zero. However, the BBBA offers a significant exception to this prohibition in allowing biofuels derived from animal manure (which is the fuel category most commonly assigned a negative emissions rate) to have a negative emissions rate. In a blow to the sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") industry, the BBBA reduces the per gallon credit for SAF from $1.75 to the amount available to other transportation fuels of $1.00, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. As with other credits, these changes are in addition to the limitations under the FEOC rules covered below.

6. Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

The BBBA accelerates the date by which clean hydrogen production projects must begin construction to December 31, 2027. This is considered a win for the sector after earlier versions of the BBBA would have required a 2025 beginning of construction date. The sector also benefits from the continued availability of the investment tax credit for hydrogen storage, compression and liquefaction equipment under section 48E and, as discussed above, the investment tax credit for hydrogen fuel cell property.

7. Termination of Other Clean Energy Credits

The BBBA significantly accelerates the end date for various tax credits relating to the acquisition of clean energy-related property. These credits, and the new applicable end dates, are as follows:

Section 25E Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit—property must be placed in service by December 31, 2025;

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit—expenditures must be incurred by December 31, 2025;

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit—property must be placed in service by June 30, 2026;

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit—home must be purchased by June 30, 2026; and

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction—property must begin construction by June 30, 2026.

8. Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)

With the exception of the Section 45V credit for hydrogen production, all IRA tax credits that survive beyond 2026 are subject to disallowance under new FEOC rules if the taxpayer, facility, or product has impermissible connections to China or other disfavored countries or entities. The FEOC rules may disallow the relevant tax credit to a ""specified foreign entity,"" a ""foreign-influenced entity,"" or an entity that receives ""material assistance"" from a ""prohibited foreign entity."" Each of those terms has a complex definition, as described below. The particular rules that apply, and the effective date of those rules, varies from credit to credit, as set forth in the table below.

A. Prohibited Foreign Entities, Specified Foreign Entities, and Foreign-Influenced Entities

1. Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" (""PFE"") is defined as either a ""specified foreign entity"" (""SFE"") or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (""FIE"").

2. Specified Foreign Entities (SFE)

An SFE is defined as a ""foreign-controlled entity"" (""FCE"") or an entity designated as a bad actor under certain existing statutes, including designation as a ""foreign entity of concern,"" a ""designated foreign terrorist organization,"" or a ""Chinese military company operating in the United States."" An FCE is defined as any of (i) the government of a covered nation (including any level of government below the national level and any agency or instrumentality thereof), (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs. A ""covered nation"" is any of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

3. Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIE)

An entity is an FIE if it satisfies either

a direct control test for the current tax year, or

with respect to the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit, an ""effective control"" test for the preceding tax year.

Under the direct control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if (i) a single SFE has the direct authority to appoint a board member, executive level officer, or person with similar powers or responsibilities, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs. Special rules apply for determining whether a publicly traded entity is an FIE.

Under the effective control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE pursuant to an agreement that entitles the SFE or a related party to exercise effective control over (i) a facility with respect to which the ITC or PTC may be available or (ii) the production of an ""eligible component"" under the section 45X manufacturing credit. The statute sets forth thirteen different powers, any one of which alone will constitute ""effective control."" These powers generally relate to power over operations or output of a facility, including exclusive control over a critical system within the facility. Six of those specified powers are operative immediately; seven of those specified powers are only relevant to the extent provided in regulations to be issued in the future. The BOC Order directs that ""within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

B. Material Assistance Rules for ITC, PTC, and Section 45X Manufacturing Credit

1. General Rules

A taxpayer is not entitled to claim the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit with respect to property with respect to which it receives ""material assistance"" from a PFE. Whether ""material assistance"" has been received is determined by comparing the ""material assistance cost ratio"" for such property to a ""threshold percentage.""

The material assistance cost ratio (""Cost Ratio"") of a qualified facility (under the ITC or PTC) or energy storage technology (under the ITC) is the ratio of (i) the total costs attributable to manufactured products (as defined for purposes of the domestic content adder) incorporated upon completion of construction excluding costs of products that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total costs attributable to manufactured products incorporated upon completion of construction. The Cost Ratio for a facility that produces eligible components under the section 45X manufacturing credit is the ratio of (i) the total direct costs that are paid or incurred for the production of an eligible component excluding costs paid or incurred for production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total direct costs paid or incurred for the production of the eligible component.

Threshold percentages are established by statute and vary by the type of property with respect to which a credit is being claimed and the year in which such property begins construction or is sold. Generally, the threshold percentages range from 40% to 95% and increase over time.

The BBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026, which will identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or total direct material costs of any eligible component which are attributable to a PFE and provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer's material assistance from a PFE. As noted above, the BOC Order directs Treasury to provide guidance regarding FEOC matters within 45 days of the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA. Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on tables issued in guidance on the domestic content adder (Notice 2025-08) and certifications provided by suppliers under penalty of perjury stating that property or direct material costs were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For purposes of the ITC and PTC, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, for use in a facility that begins construction before August 1, 2025 and is placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities), will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

For purposes of the section 45X manufacturing credit, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and used in a product sold before January 1, 2027 will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

2. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Within the definitions of a PFE and ""material assistance,"" the BBBA directly incorporates IRS Notice 2013-29 and subsequent related guidance addressing the beginning of construction of a project or facility for tax purposes, as in effect on January 1, 2025. The narrow context (PFE and material assistance) in which the BBBA adopts the BOC principles in effect on January 1, 2025, suggests that this ""freeze"" of BOC guidance as of January 1, 2025, does not apply in any other context. That appears to be the theory underlying the President's direction to Treasury in the BOC Order to provide ""new and revised"" guidance regarding the meaning of ""beginning of construction"" for purposes of the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar.

3. Penalties and Statute of Limitations

The FEOC rules impose new or harsher penalties relating to the material assistance rule and a longer statute of limitations for IRS examination of material assistance issues.

A taxpayer that claims a credit which is later disallowed due to an IRS adjustment to the Cost Ratio of the underlying property may be liable for a substantial understatement penalty on understatements of tax greater than 1% of the true tax liability, as opposed to the normal 10%.

A supplier who makes a certification under the material assistance rules that it knows or reasonably should have known is false will generally be required to pay a penalty of 10% of the resulting underpayment of tax by its customer.

The period during which the IRS may assess additional tax for an error relating to material assistance from a PFE is extended to six years.

4. ITC Recapture Rule for FEOC Effective Control Payments

A taxpayer will be subject to recapture of 100% of the ITC claimed with respect to a property if within 10 years after the property is placed in service it makes a payment that would be deemed to provide an SFE with ""effective control"" over the taxpayer as described above. This rule applies to property placed in service in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

5. Summary of Application of FEOC Rules to Surviving Tax Credits

The table below summarizes the applicability of the FEOC rules disallowing tax credits to specified foreign entities, foreign-influenced entities and taxpayers who receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Credit Restrictions on SFEs Restrictions on FIEs Restrictions on Property with Material Assistance from a PFE Section 45Q—Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but ""effective control"" test does not apply).

No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. ""Eligible components"" do not include any property which includes material assistance from a PFE for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Section 45Y—Clean Electricity Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities do not include any facility the construction of which includes material assistance from a PFE, and which begins construction after December 31, 2025. Section 45Z—Clean Fuel Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (but ""effective control"" test does not apply). None Section 48E—Clean Electricity Investment Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology do not include property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025, if such construction includes material assistance from a PFE.

In addition to the time pressure to implement begun construction strategies and understand the implications of the FEOC rules, the BBBA creates a number of significant changes to existing tax credits, as well as adding new uncertainties for credit qualification, which may affect tax equity and transferability strategies. We at Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in these and other clean energy tax incentive matters.

Footnote

1 ""ITC"" refers to the clean electricity investment credit under section 48E. ""PTC"" refers to the clean electricity production credit under section 45Y. Apart from some changes affecting geothermal heat pump property, the BBBA did not impose new restrictions or limitations on the energy credit under section 48 or the renewable electricity production credit under section 45, both of which are generally available only if construction of the relevant property began before 2025.

The factory would produce cylindrical 46-Series electric vehicle (EV) batteries and pouch-type LFP batteries for BESS applications.
LG ES said it would invest around US$1.4 billion in the plan.
Originally equipped with production lines for electric vehicle (EV) battery cells, the facility will be reconfigured to support mass production of energy storage system (ESS) cells.","According to the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations, to qualify for investment tax credit (ITC) incentives, starting in 2026, at least 55% of a project’s costs must originate from non-prohibited foreign entities, rising to 75% by 2030 and onwards.

This is highly likely to include materials, equipment and financing originating in China. At the same time, the tariff dispute between the US and China, while currently ‘paused’ with import tariffs for batteries at 54% of the goods’ value until 12 August, has also thrown the industry a major curveball.

Speaking with Energy-Storage.news, Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF) recently said:

“If you look at the safe harbour cost table for domestic content, battery cells account for around 52%, so because the threshold for the non-prohibited foreign entities starting from 2026 is 55%, it will be very crucial for all projects in the US that want to get their tax credits to use non-prohibited foreign entity-related cells.”

US-made batteries are far from abundant, positioning First Phosphate and LG ES in what could soon become a rapidly developing market.

First Phosphate produces LFP cells in Quebec

First Phosphate has produced commercial-grade LFP 18650 format battery cells using “North American-sourced critical minerals.”

The company is based in Canada and connects phosphate mining in Quebec with US battery supply chains.

First Phosphate says its batteries are aimed at the energy storage, data centre, robotics, mobility, and defence sectors.

A recent report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) notes critical minerals as “nonfuel mineral(s) essential for use and facing considerable supply chain vulnerabilities.”

The table below details where First Phosphate’s critical minerals are sourced from.

Ultion Technologies, a private battery technology company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, assembled the cells for First Phosphate.

In 2023, First Phosphate signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with American Battery Factory (ABF), which partnered with KAN Battery in the same year, also to pilot a line of LFP battery cells, to on-shore up to 40,000 tonnes of annual LFP cathode active material production in North America.

Speaking with ESN, First Phosphate CEO John Passalacqua confirmed that the MOU with ABF is still in place and should remain until 2028.

LG ES operates LFP cell factory in Michigan

In 2024, LG Energy Solution (LG ES) started construction on an Arizona gigafactory, which was planned to have an annual 17GWh production capacity dedicated to the BESS market.

The factory would produce cylindrical 46-Series electric vehicle (EV) batteries and pouch-type LFP batteries for BESS applications.

That factory was put on ‘pause’, with LG ES head of ESS Hyung-Sik Kim and LG ES Vertech CEO Jaehong Park telling Energy-Storage.news Premium it was part of a strategy to shift capacity between EV and ESS products based on lower than expected demand for the former and growing demand for ESS.

In February this year, the company informed the Korea Stock Exchange that it had chosen to offer a debt guarantee to its affiliate, LG Energy Storage Michigan. LG ES said it would invest around US$1.4 billion in the plan.

The subsidiary runs one of LG ES’s existing factories in Holland, Michigan, US. Originally equipped with production lines for electric vehicle (EV) battery cells, the facility will be reconfigured to support mass production of energy storage system (ESS) cells.

LG ES Vertech CEO Jaehong Park spoke with ESN Premium in March about the retooling of three EV battery production lines, each of 5.5GWh annual capacity. Park noted that there were “not many major renovations required,” although the differing design of the cells, including the larger capacity and longer cycle life of cells for stationary storage applications, necessitated perhaps the most work.

The company began producing ESS batteries at the Michigan factory in early May, claiming to be the first facility in the US to produce LFP batteries at scale. An official event to celebrate the start of production was held 24 June at the site.

LG ES states that its factory has an average annual production capacity of 16.5GWh, with ESS battery modules and containers scheduled for production starting in August.

Additionally, LG ES will manufacture nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells for the Ford Mustang Mach-E, having recently transferred this production from the company’s facility in Wroclaw, Poland.

Other companies are working in domestic cell manufacturing as well.

The stock closed down 36.4% at $2.81 on Monday, before slipping another 6% to $2.64 in after-hours trading.

Under the proposed deal, the unnamed manufacturer would merge into a newly formed Workhorse subsidiary in exchange for newly issued common stock, potentially giving the manufacturer’s investors a controlling stake in the company.

As part of the potential transaction, Workhorse also outlined plans to refinance its $33 million in outstanding senior secured convertible notes.

This would include a new convertible note and a roughly $20 million sale-leaseback of its Union City, Indiana, plant.

The refinancing plan contemplates the cancellation of existing warrants and the issuance of 3 million new shares to the current institutional investor in the notes.

Workhorse said that terms are not final and no definitive agreements have been signed.

As part of the process, Workhorse signed an exclusivity agreement with the manufacturer on Monday.

For the next 14 days, and subject to standard fiduciary exceptions, the company has agreed not to share information with, negotiate with, or enter into any deal with another party that could lead to an alternative transaction.

It also said it had explored other options before starting these talks and cautioned that there’s no guarantee the deal will happen or that it will proceed under the current terms.

On March 17, Workhorse executed a 1-for-12.5 reverse stock split to lift its share price.

By April 2, the company had received formal notice from Nasdaq confirming it had regained compliance with the exchange’s $1.00 minimum bid requirement.

Net sales for the first quarter totaled $0.6 million, down from $1.3 million a year earlier.

The decline was attributed to the divestiture of the Aero business and lower truck sales.

Cost of sales fell to $5.2 million from $7.4 million, driven by reduced inventory reserves and lower labor costs due to workforce furloughs.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for Workhorse was ‘extremely bullish’ amid a 1,373% boom in 24-hour message volume.

One user compared the proposed merger to a SPAC-style deal, but saw potential upside, pointing to improved positioning in the EV market, reduced financial strain through note refinancing, and a possible $20 million boost from a sale-leaseback agreement.

The user also noted that combining with a strategic partner could strengthen Workhorse’s competitiveness, especially if it brings complementary assets or customer relationships.

Another user described the timing of stock fall as “peculiar” and said that market behavior could remain unpredictable, adding that there might currently be a higher chance of an “absurd pump” continuing than not.

Workhorse’s stock has declined 70% so far in 2025.

(KGTV) — President Trump's tax and spending bill, known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" is cutting short the timeline for homeowners to claim thousands of dollars in clean energy tax credits. The rebates, originally set to last for seven more years, will now end this December.

Homeowners like Alex Dam of Rancho Bernardo are feeling the impact of this policy change. Dam recently installed a new heat pump to replace his 16-year-old system, saving money in the process.

""It was $20,000. The gas AC was gonna be $25,000,"" Dam said.

When Dam files his taxes next year, he could receive up to $2,000 back through tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

""It's great. It's one of the reasons I went with a higher-end system,"" Dam said.

Dam, who is about to retire, had been planning additional clean energy upgrades for his home that would have qualified for tax credits. Now those plans have changed.

""I will probably wait for a water heater pump, which is one of the next things I was gonna get. But without the rebate, those are too expensive for me,"" Dam said.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 had set aside billions in rebates and tax breaks for homeowners upgrading to clean energy systems like heat pumps, insulation, EV chargers, and solar panels. President Trump's new legislation eliminates these incentives.

The president says the change will save more than $500 billion in federal spending over the next decade. He also argues that the green energy push was costing too much and undermining oil and gas sources, which he believes are more reliable.

Dam says his neighbors are now rushing to make improvements before the December deadline.

""So this year will be probably a banner year for energy improvements, while next year will probably be a desert for energy improvements,"" Dam said.

Brad Gastineau, a CPA and tax partner, recommends that homeowners act quickly, especially for solar installations.

""I'm suspecting that solar is gonna be very difficult,"" Gastineau said.

Solar panels qualify for a 30% tax credit if they're operational by the December deadline. However, Gastineau advises consulting with an accountant before making any purchases.

""You need to have a tax liability in order to benefit from that credit,"" Gastineau said. ""But if, for whatever reason, you don't benefit from this tax credit, it may not be quite as good a deal as you thought at the beginning.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8248498/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2F337%2F790551469ef2448fbb6dfa541303db12%2F337537e86ddf423fb137e382ca7066da%2Fposter_8f1418c08aad44bcb7d288246c4af153.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 23:02:54.789537

Climate change reporting

Every couple of years, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) puts out the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The goal is to keep the public informed about the impacts of climate change and help guide decision-making at the local, state and federal levels of government.

The USGCRP is comprised of thirteen different agencies, with more than 300 people contributing to the production of the full reports. The latest report, released in 2023, highlighted the dangers of climate change, with the next one scheduled for 2027.

A 1990 law requires that report to be established. Earlier this month, the Trump administration shut down the official government website that hosts the reports.

The White House indicated NASA would then host those reports but is now backtracking on that plan.

“The USGCRP met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov’s data,” NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens told the Associated Press.

The AP reports Stevens said no data from the latest report will be on the NASA website.

“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” former Obama White House Science Advisor John Holdren told the Associated Press. “In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology.”

While he has professed his love for “clean air and clean water,” Trump has criticized climate change and adjacent initiatives as overly burdensome. The president has also said regulations like those that promote renewable energy are inefficient. He declared a national energy emergency earlier in his second term that put a focus on maximizing domestic power production.

The reports still live on the internet at this website.

Pulling climate change from the spotlight

While we know the administration no longer plans on publishing these reports, it’s unclear if the next one will even take place despite the legal requirement. Some 400 scientists working on that next report were all fired back in April.

CBS News reports that those scientists received an email letting them go. That email reportedly said the scope of the assessment is being “reevaluated.”

The Trump administration has also taken other actions to avoid climate change data. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) did not publish a mandatory annual report on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that goes to the United Nations.

They also put an end to the “billion-dollar weather and climate disasters” database, which tracks the cost of extreme weather and climate events.

Project 2025

Targeting the USGCRP is something that was laid out in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. Despite President Donald Trump distancing himself from that initiative, this is the latest policy shift to go along with that plan.

Other major Project 2025 plans the president has followed include abolishing the Department of Education, ending DEI practices and banning transgender people from the military.

This story is republished through our partnership with NOTUS.

The city of Norman, Oklahoma, was prepared to build an automatic flood warning system this year—the same kind of early warning system that Kerr County, Texas, could have used to help save lives during the deadly floods over the July Fourth weekend.

But in April, the Trump administration said it was ending the “wasteful and ineffective” program that would have paid for it. The city, which dealt with flooding as recently as June, was forced to table its $313,000 project to install automated sensors and cameras to monitor water levels and provide real-time alerts to the public.

“Now we don’t have that automated system that we would very much like to have if there was funding available for it,” Tiffany Vrska, a spokesperson for the city of Norman, said of the administration pulling back the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program.

President Donald Trump’s administration has systematically reduced states’ access to resources to safeguard their people against natural disasters, frustrating city and state leaders across the country—including from communities that overwhelmingly voted for Trump.

“I’m a super big fan of the president, but I’m going to challenge him any time he gets something wrong,” Wade Evans, the mayor of Central, Louisiana, told NOTUS. Central regularly faces flooding, and a disastrous 2016 flood submerged thousands of homes and other structures in the city of roughly 30,000 just east of Baton Rouge.

A FEMA grant for $39 million was intended to stop a cycle of repeated flooding, damage and repair for hundreds of structures in the city. Evans estimated that the project, by creating new retention areas for flood waters, would save more than $100 million in projected losses over time.

“I never thought I would have to evacuate my neighborhood. Have my kids evacuated on a boat, crying. This isn’t wasteful at all. This is actual brick-and-mortar solutions that have nothing to do with politics,” Evans said.

While the administration is backtracking on Trump’s initial proposal to completely eliminate FEMA, the agency has been relentless in continuing to cut programs aimed at lessening the catastrophic impact of future disasters.

In February, the Trump administration took down the application for the Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant Program, which was supposed to make $600 million in grants available this year to reduce long-term flood risks, especially for properties that are covered by government-funded flood insurance. The Biden administration opened applications for the latest round of that program in January, and some states were already preparing lists of places that badly need support.

Then, in April, FEMA retracted both awarded and planned grants for well over 50 communities under the BRIC program, including Norman and Central.

The administration maintains that the disaster resilience program was “wasteful,” despite Trump signing the law creating the program in 2018.

“BRIC was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with climate change than helping Americans affected by natural disasters. We are committed to ensuring that Americans in crisis can get the help and resources they need,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to NOTUS.

This term, Trump has also ended the standard practice of granting funding for hazard mitigation when states experience a major federal disaster—including for Texas. Texas’s request for hazard mitigation funding is “pending.”

Many states, including Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Mississippi, were ultimately denied hazard mitigation funds this year. Trump also denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA to match 100 percent of the state’s investment in recovery from Hurricane Helene this year, reversing an offer set by the Biden administration.

In September 2023, an intense storm swept rapid flooding through homes, cars and bridges in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Over the course of a long night, the city sent firefighters in rescue boats to pull people trapped in flooding homes. The firefighters saved lives, but no one could save the homes.

Now, more than a year later, those homes still stand rotting and uninhabitable. It’s not safe to rebuild them, and it will never be safe for anyone to live there again.

So Scranton applied for a $2.5 million BRIC grant to buy the homes from their owners, knock them down, and turn them into soccer fields—areas that can be used by the community when the weather is normal and safely flood when the weather turns extreme.

“To hear about FEMA pulling this down was a shock,” Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti said. She said she doesn’t know where the city will find the money to buy the ruined homes, but she knows that it needs to happen.

“This was a $10 million storm. I can’t sustain another $10 million storm, our coffers don’t have that, there’s just no well to go back to,” Cognetti said.

Cognetti is a Democrat. In Congress, her city is represented by freshman House Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who won Trump’s endorsement and has voted for the president’s priorities. On FEMA, however, Bresnahan wants the administration to reverse course.

“This one is pretty close to the heart here. I remember sand-bagging my grandparents’ house,” he said, talking about floods that filled their first floor with four feet of water. “The first time you remember the smell of flood mud, it’s something you’ll never forget.”

Bresnahan is one of several House and Senate Republicans to challenge the White House on pulling the BRIC program by introducing a bill with bipartisan sponsorship that would require FEMA to disburse the funds. He is planning on introducing a second piece of legislation this week that would require FEMA to study the effectiveness of its hazard mitigation efforts, he told NOTUS.

“I don’t feel this is a partisan issue. This is about keeping our community safe and our infrastructure reliable,” he said. “We have to do something. These small communities just don’t have the available capital to be able to make these investments independently.”

Other Republicans have also challenged FEMA on the BRIC program in hearings and letters: Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.

So far, their advocacy hasn’t succeeded. The BRIC grantees who spoke with NOTUS have not been able to restore their funding—even after Evans, the Central, Louisiana, mayor, came to Washington, D.C. to meet with the Louisiana delegation and other interested Republicans.

“I’ve had no luck trying to talk to FEMA,” Evans said. “You take our tax dollars up there in Washington, and you give us a set of guidelines, and we follow everything to a T. We spend the money putting the application together, and you award us the project, and then, with all the whims of an administration, you take it from us. And I’m talking about an area that has overwhelmingly supported the president’s agenda.”

The kinds of floods that killed more than 100 people, including dozens of children, along the Guadalupe River in Texas earlier this month are becoming increasingly frequent in the United States.

About 90 percent of U.S. disasters involve flooding, as the number of floods with catastrophic effects increase globally. After heat-related deaths, floods are the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States. Severe flooding events after periods of intense rainfall, like what happened in Texas (either overwhelming rivers or overwhelming sewer systems) have become more common in the United States over the last several decades, according to research from the First Street Institute and U.S. Geological Survey data.

“The water is coming down at a pace that municipalities cannot keep up with. It’s cities, it’s rural counties, you name it, the water doesn’t discern,” Cognetti said.

Other communities that lost their BRIC program funding include Wood River, Nebraska; Crisfield, Maryland; Forsyth, Montana; and Goldsboro and Taylorsville, North Carolina. Roughly 60 percent of the projects awarded funds through BRIC in 2024 were located in counties that voted for Trump in the most recent election.

The Trump administration isn’t just removing funding—it’s also reducing disaster mitigation regulations. In March, FEMA revoked the requirement that structures like hospitals, wastewater treatment plants and fire stations damaged in previous floods be designed to withstand greater risks if they want to use federal dollars to rebuild. The Trump administration argued the rules—first introduced under President Obama, repealed during Trump’s first term, and then reintroduced under Biden—slowed down recovery.

“They know what their hazards are. They know what they need to do to reduce the impact. Yet now we’ve taken away that funding source,” Deanne Criswell, FEMA administrator under Biden, told NOTUS. “This is how we should be spending our taxpayer dollars. We should be doing smart investments so that we don’t have to respond, so that we don’t have to recover as much.”

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in collaboration with insurance provider Allstate, found that every $1 spent on disaster preparedness leads to about $7 saved in economic costs for a community, in a 2024 study looking at 25 disaster scenarios. The National Institute of Building Sciences found that for every $1 invested in resilience, communities save anywhere from $4 to $11 in future losses, depending on where in the country the disaster happens. These studies also conclude that communities receive economic benefits from these types of investments even if no disaster strikes.

“If we are going to provide disaster assistance to individuals and to communities to repair, why should we not have an additional source of funding to break that cycle so that we’re not perpetually providing repair assistance?” said Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers.

“It’s a good investment for the taxpayer. Disaster assistance is a good leg up for the individual and the business owner and the community, but mitigation is an overall good investment for taxpayers because it breaks the cycle.”

That hasn’t been the administration’s view. From the beginning, Trump and top administration officials have said they would like local governments to lead recovery efforts. “FEMA will continue to support Americans impacted by disasters no matter the state or jurisdiction they live in, allowing local governments to lead the response managed by their states,” the DHS spokesperson said. DHS did not specify how possible changes to FEMA’s structure would impact states’ budgets.

The president’s budget proposal to Congress included language referring to the BRIC program that appeared to recognize its value, stating: It “mitigates against the impacts of natural hazard to lower future disaster costs.” The budget did not specify whether the administration plans to direct any funding toward it or disperse any awarded grants.

The budget document has similar language praising the hazard mitigation grant funding that Trump has been denying states since April. “HMGP reduces future need for Federal disaster assistance by reducing the impact of and increasing the resistance to natural disasters,” it reads.

Still, local leaders have no idea how much money they are going to be expected to find for disasters moving forward.

“The very real possibility that FEMA is not going to be there for us financially or even operationally, it’s scary,” Cognetti said. “It’s scary about saving people’s lives, it’s scary because we won’t be able to proactively mitigate things as well, and it’s scary from a public safety standpoint.”",https://www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25192677723714-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 01:01:27.503364

“The reality is, with or without clean energy tax credits, California’s energy demand is growing at a historic rate, and solar and storage are the fastest and most affordable way to meet that demand,” Gallagher said.
“The fourth largest economy in the world is running on more clean energy than ever before,” Newsom said in a statement.
“For years now, too many California leaders have retreated from true clean energy leadership — hopefully the tax bill serves as a wakeup call that their leadership on clean energy is more important now than ever,” Gallagher said.
“We’ve really aggressively invested in clean energy, and we need to ramp up that investment, and we need to make it easier and faster to get clean energy deployed.”STATE SENATOR SCOTT WIENERThe state Legislature has debated for years exempting some clean energy projects from the state’s landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act, which is often blamed for delays.","California’s drive to run its electric grid entirely on wind, solar and other clean sources of energy just got harder after President Donald Trump signed a sweeping new budget law.

The changes in federal tax incentives could affect the feasibility of new solar and wind projects as the state is counting on them to provide more electricity for Californians. A state law requires 100% of electricity to be powered by renewable, carbon-free sources by 2045, at the same time it’s moving to electrify cars and trucks.

Incentives championed by former President Joe Biden were rolled back, shortening the timeline for the industry to obtain tax credits. Developers of wind and solar projects now face a new, shorter deadline for obtaining tax credits — most now expire at the end of 2027 instead of no sooner than 2032.

In addition, the new federal rules bar companies from accessing tax credits if they rely on major components from China or other “foreign entities of concern.” This restriction could hit California’s solar and wind industry especially hard, experts said.

The changes to tax credits are estimated to save the federal government approximately $499 billion from 2025–2034.

“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” Trump wrote in an executive order last week. “The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.”

Projects can still be built without tax credits. But it puts more of a financial burden on their investors. In California, 11 solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation, according to an analysis of federal data by Atlas Public Policy provided to CalMatters. The projects are spread across the Central Valley, Inland Empire and Northern California.

Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement that the industry was still “assessing what the federal tax bill means for them.” He warned the changes could jeopardize up to 35,700 solar jobs and 25 solar manufacturing facilities in California — including existing positions and factories as well as future projects that may now never materialize.

“The reality is, with or without clean energy tax credits, California’s energy demand is growing at a historic rate, and solar and storage are the fastest and most affordable way to meet that demand,” Gallagher said.

California in recent years has been fast-tracking massive floating offshore wind farms 20 miles off the coasts of Humboldt County and Morro Bay. The federal changes add some uncertainty that could chill investment. But experts say it’s not a death knell for the industry because the projects weren’t set to seek federal permits or generate electricity for at least several years.

“Offshore wind is what we would call a long-lead project. It does take years and years to develop,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, former chair of the Assembly’s Offshore Wind Select Committee. “Solar is a little bit shorter of a time frame…but it's also his incredibly erratic behavior when it comes to market stability overall that is also going to affect these projects in a negative way.”

Experts say in the long-run, the federal changes could drive up energy costs.

""Tax credit savings are typically passed onto ratepayers through lower contracting costs. In the long term, the repeal of the tax credits will result in higher future electricity rates for customers,"" the California Energy Commission told CalMatters.

Rising utility bills are already a major political headache for state leaders and a challenge for clean energy advocates who want the state to lead the way in making electricity cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable.

“The whole point of California's climate policy is not just to reduce California's carbon footprint — because we are less than 1% of global emissions — but to set an example and show that this can be done,” Berkeley economist Severin Borenstein told CalMatters. “There are going to be fewer other states following our example because it's going to be more expensive.”

The new hurdles for solar and wind come as they are scaling up to meet surging electricity demand nationwide, including from energy-hungry data centers fueling the rise of artificial intelligence.

California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner, in an interview with CalMatters, said the federal law is a national “job killer” and was short-sighted. “The economics of renewable energy generation speak for themselves....The cost of solar generation now is competitive with natural gas,” she said.

“We're not going to back away from our commitments and our goals,” she added. “Our commitment — whether it is to zero-emission vehicles, or to renewable energy generation — is about cleaning the air as well as addressing the climate crisis…Nobody wants to live in smoggy communities, where the air you're breathing hurts you.”

Solar and wind projects have helped California log key renewable energy milestones in recent years. Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom said nine out of every 10 days so far in 2025 have been powered by non-fossil fuels for at least a part of the day: “The economics of renewable energy generation speak for themselves....The cost of solar generation now is competitive with natural gas.""

The state’s grid runs on a mix of renewables — solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, biomass and hydropower — an average of seven hours a day, the governor said, citing new data compiled by the California Energy Commission.

“The fourth largest economy in the world is running on more clean energy than ever before,” Newsom said in a statement. “Trump and Republicans can try all they want to take us back to the days of dirty coal but the future is cheap, abundant clean energy.”

But industry officials say the state isn’t doing enough. They say the state has too many hurdles for building wind and solar projects and needs to offer more funding.

“For years now, too many California leaders have retreated from true clean energy leadership — hopefully the tax bill serves as a wakeup call that their leadership on clean energy is more important now than ever,” Gallagher said.

Trump and Congress did not shorten the tax credit deadlines for nuclear power plants, hydroelectric facilities, battery storage and geothermal plants. Congress also dropped a provision that would have added a new excise tax on wind and solar.

For wind and solar, there's still a possible path to claim tax credits if construction starts within a year or they come online by the end of 2027. Senators added that provision to soften the blow. In theory, those projects could be finished and connected to the grid as late as 2031 and still qualify, but that depends on how the Treasury Department defines what it means to “start construction,” said Kevin Book, an energy analyst based in Washington, D.C.

“In the short-term, it might actually increase or shift earlier expenditure on these kinds of clean energy projects and all else equal,” said David Victor, a professor of public policy at UC San Diego. “California is in a pretty good position to profit from that acceleration.”

But Victor warned that the long-term costs could become “a political nightmare.”

“The long-term incentive, clearly, is to try to slow down investment in solar and wind and electric vehicles,” Victor said.

Borenstein took a more measured view about the impact on costs: California’s high electricity prices aren’t mainly about power production — they’re driven by wildfire costs, including past damage payouts and upgrades to prevent future fires. Other drivers include subsidies for low-income customers and the cost shift from rooftop solar, he said.

Some legislators have advocated for the state budget to cover more of these costs, but Borenstein said it’s politically easier to keep charging customers through their electric bills.

Alex Jackson, who leads the industry group American Clean Power California, said the state should use money from its cap-and-trade program to lower bills. Cap and trade is a market system that charges California companies for the greenhouse gas emissions they produce. Jackson said those funds could help pay for grid upgrades so ratepayers don’t have to.

He said the state also could lower clean energy costs by speeding up permitting, easing environmental rules for upgrades to existing projects and reducing costs for turning farmland into solar farms. He also called for expanding regional electricity markets to help California trade power more efficiently — a controversial idea being debated in the Legislature this year.

“We’ve really aggressively invested in clean energy, and we need to ramp up that investment, and we need to make it easier and faster to get clean energy deployed.”STATE SENATOR SCOTT WIENERThe state Legislature has debated for years exempting some clean energy projects from the state’s landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act, which is often blamed for delays. State Sen. Scott Wiener, of San Francisco, has advocated for such changes.

“California has always been a leader, and we need to step that up significantly,” Wiener told CalMatters. “We’ve really aggressively invested in clean energy, and we need to ramp up that investment, and we need to make it easier and faster to get clean energy deployed.”

In addition to the wind and solar credits, the budget signed by Trump also ends tax credits for purchase of electric cars, rooftop solar panels, home batteries, heat pumps, insulation, energy-efficient windows and doors, and other upgrades. Rooftop solar tax credits end this year. Federal tax credits for hydrogen production end after 2027 — a blow for California, which had positioned itself as a national hydrogen hub. Those changes are estimated to save about $543 billion from 2025–2034.

The state Energy Commission said the elimination of the EV credits beginning on Sept. 30 will mean ""lower adoption of electric vehicles"" and a ""potential short-term spike in ZEV sales"" before that date. Rooftop solar projects and heat pump sales also are likely to decrease, the agency said.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43d91b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F48%2Fd0aca0e043f4baa7d8ef1de8a2f4%2F051023-mojave-wind-turbines-lv-cm-09-jpg.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 22:07:34.273551

The number of drilled but uncompleted wells dropped to 5,291 in June, the lowest since records began in 2013—suggesting limited ability to quickly ramp up supply, even if prices rise.

Some producers briefly capitalized on a price spike during a U.S.-Iran standoff, triggering a wave of hedging “to lock in higher prices.” But that premium faded quickly when Tehran backed off threats to energy infrastructure.

Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 15.2 cents, or 4.6%, to settle at $3.466 per million British thermal units, their highest close since July 2.

That price increase occurred despite rising output and forecasts for lower demand over the next two weeks than previously expected.

Even though gas futures have dropped about 14% over the past three weeks, speculators last week boosted their net long futures and options positions on the New York Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange to their highest levels since early April, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report showed.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said a tropical system off the east coast of Florida has about a 30% chance of strengthening into a tropical cyclone as it moves west into the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida over the next week.

Analysts have noted that tropical storms in the Gulf can knock some production out of service, but noted that only about 2% of all U.S. gas output comes from the federal offshore Gulf of Mexico.

The analysts noted that storms were more likely to be demand-destroying events that leave homes and businesses without power and can shut LNG export plants.

Meteorologists slightly reduced their forecasts for hotter weather for this week but continued to project the Lower 48 U.S. states will remain mostly warmer than normal through at least July 29, especially in late July.

Even though the weather has remained above normal so far this summer, analysts expect energy firms to keep injecting more gas into storage than usual in coming weeks. That’s because output hit a record high in June and was on track to top that in July, while gas flows to LNG export plants have so far languished since hitting a record in April.

There is currently about 6% more gas in storage than the five-year (2020-2024) normal for this time of year, and analysts expect that surplus to grow in coming weeks. Some analysts, however, noted that an expected rise in LNG exports should start to chip away at that surplus later this year.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 rose to 106.8 billion cubic feet per day so far in July, up from a monthly record high of 106.4 bcfd in June.

LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would slide from 107.8 bcfd this week to 106.8 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG’s outlook on Friday.

The average amount of gas flowing to the eight big U.S. LNG export plants rose to 15.8 bcfd so far in July as liquefaction units at some plants slowly exited maintenance reductions and unexpected outages. That was up from 14.3 bcfd in June and 15.0 bcfd in May, but remained below the monthly record high of 16.0 bcfd in April.

On a daily basis, LNG export feedgas was on track to rise to a three-month high of 16.6 bcfd on Monday with flows to U.S. energy company Venture Global LNG’s 3.2-bcfd Plaquemines plant in Louisiana up to a record 2.9 bcfd on Sunday, according to LSEG data.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows: Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.
RTI also lost five other EPA grants totaling more than $36 million.
Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.
“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.","This story was originally published by Floodlight.

Acre by acre, the village of Kipnuk is falling into the river.

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines, and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.

So when the village learned late in 2024 that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.

But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.

“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul said.

Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.

The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete, and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.

Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.

The single largest grant canceled: a $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute (RTI), a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

In June, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.

“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience, and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:

“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.

But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.

Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.

“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.

On July 10, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.

Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well, and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.

But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: their grant had been canceled.

“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.

Roberts and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.

The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.

“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dcf88d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+115/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2F52%2F3ecb262e4e1d9971dbc898ed41b6%2Ferosion-damage-on-riverbank-in-kipnuk.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 23:02:48.801706

As recovery efforts continue and the full scale of destruction becomes clearer, the disaster is reigniting fierce debate over climate resilience, infrastructure investment, and the federal government’s role in emergency response.

The unprecedented scale of destruction has transformed this natural disaster into a political and environmental wake-up call for the entire nation.

Devastation across multiple counties

Days of relentless storms and torrential rainfall overwhelmed riverbanks and reservoirs across Central Texas, triggering flash floods that swept through homes, roads, and entire neighborhoods. Counties including Hays, Travis, Bastrop, and Caldwell have been hardest hit, with emergency services stretched thin amid widespread damage and power outages.

Search and rescue operations are still ongoing, with helicopters, boats, and National Guard units combing devastated areas for survivors. Officials say time is critical, as many affected regions remain inaccessible due to washed-out bridges and mudslides.

The human cost continues to mount as families search for missing loved ones and entire communities grapple with the loss of homes, businesses, and infrastructure that took decades to build.

Economic damage reaches billions

Preliminary estimates suggest economic damages between $18 billion and $22 billion, encompassing infrastructure, agriculture, housing, and business losses. Thousands of homes are uninhabitable, and hundreds of small businesses have reported total losses. Highways have been torn apart, leaving some rural communities stranded.

Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency in 45 counties, while President Trump announced enhanced FEMA support and endorsed a stronger state-federal partnership for disaster response. This shift represents a significant change from his previous stance on federal disaster assistance.

The economic ripple effects extend far beyond Texas, with supply chain disruptions affecting agriculture, energy, and manufacturing sectors nationwide.

Climate change takes center stage

As images of submerged towns and displaced families flood national news and social media, environmental advocates, scientists, and lawmakers are seizing the moment to spotlight climate change’s role in amplifying extreme weather events.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Central Texas has experienced a 400% increase in extreme rainfall events over the past two decades. Warmer air holds more moisture, making storms more intense — a trend that’s expected to continue without significant climate action.

Climate scientists emphasize that these aren’t isolated once-in-a-century events anymore, but part of a disturbing new normal that demands a serious federal response.

FEMA under mounting pressure

The flood has also raised urgent questions about the preparedness and agility of FEMA, which has faced criticism in recent years for underfunding, staffing shortages, and slow response times. While the agency responded swiftly to the Texas disaster, reports of delayed shelter setups and overwhelmed hotlines have drawn public frustration.

Congressional leaders are now pushing for a review of FEMA’s budget and emergency infrastructure, especially as severe weather events strain resources nationwide. A growing number of lawmakers are also calling for permanent disaster aid reform, including pre-disaster planning funds and incentives for cities to climate-proof infrastructure.

Political implications emerge

The flood’s fallout is extending beyond the environmental and economic spheres. It’s shaping up to be a key political flashpoint ahead of the 2026 midterms, with Republican and Democratic candidates offering competing visions for managing climate risk and federal funding.

Some politicians are using the disaster to advocate for increased infrastructure spending and climate adaptation measures, while others focus on immediate disaster relief and recovery efforts.

Stories of heroism amid tragedy

Meanwhile, stories of heroism and heartbreak are emerging from the chaos. One mother in Bastrop reportedly formed a human chain with neighbors to rescue stranded children from rising waters. In San Marcos, residents used kayaks and fishing boats to evacuate elderly residents from a flooded nursing home.

These individual acts of courage highlight the resilience of Texas communities while underscoring the human cost of inadequate disaster preparedness and infrastructure.

Long-term recovery challenges ahead

The recovery will take months — if not years. Federal disaster assistance is being fast-tracked, but local officials warn that long-term housing and mental health support will be critical. Some communities are already planning climate-resilient rebuilding efforts, including elevated housing, improved drainage systems, and new emergency warning networks.

The disaster raises fundamental questions about how communities should rebuild in an era of increasingly frequent extreme weather events.

A climate reality check

This disaster has made one thing clear: America’s climate future is no longer hypothetical. For Texas and much of the nation, the storm has arrived — and the question now is how to prepare for what comes next.

The Central Texas floods serve as a stark reminder that climate change isn’t a distant threat — it’s a present reality demanding immediate action and long-term planning.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_704663569-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 22:08:10.913470

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA), which makes permanent or modifies key provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) and scales back numerous energy tax incentives enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This alert is a summary of certain general business tax, clean energy tax credit and international tax provisions of the OBBBA. All section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

General Business Tax

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k) and (n))

Permanence. The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

Qualified Production Property. New Section 168(n) allows an immediate deduction for 100 percent of the cost of “qualified production property.” Generally, qualified production property is any domestic manufacturing, refining, agricultural production or chemical production facility the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025 and before January 1, 2029 and that is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031.

Domestic R&E. The OBBBA restores immediate expensing of domestic R&E expenditures under new Section 174A for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. This reverses the five-year amortization requirement that took effect in 2022 under the TCJA. Section 174A does not allow expensing of amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas).

Capitalization. Capitalization and amortization of domestic R&E expenditures remains available upon election.

Business Interest Limitation (Section 163(j))

EBITDA Calculation Reinstated. The OBBBA permanently returns the limitation on business interest deductibility to an EBITDA-based formula, reversing the more restrictive EBIT-based test in effect since 2022. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Ordering. The OBBBA provides that the Section 163(j) limitation is calculated prior to applying any interest capitalization provisions (subject to certain exceptions) and requires taxpayers to first apply their allowed business interest deduction against business interest that would otherwise be capitalized. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Expansion of Qualifying Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Clean Energy Expansion. The OBBBA expands the definition of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 to include income from the transportation or storage of certain clean fuels, production of electricity from certain clean sources and other energy-transition infrastructure.

Partnership Transactions (Section 707(a)(2))

Self-execution. The OBBBA confirms that Section 707(a)(2), which addresses disguised sales between partners and partnerships, is self-executing. This eliminates any ambiguity about the enforceability of the disguised sales rules with respect to disguised sales of partnership interests in the absence of final regulations.

Deduction for Qualified Business Income (Section 199A)

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the 20 percent deduction for qualified business income.

Excess Business Loss Limitation (Section 461(l))

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the limitation on excess business losses for noncorporate taxpayers, which was set to expire after 2028. Excess losses will continue to be converted into net operating losses carried forward to future years.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) and Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) (Subchapter Z)

QOZ Renewal. The OBBBA renews the QOZ program with new QOZ designations to be made on July 1, 2026 and each July 1st every 10 years thereafter. New QOZ designations will go into effect on January 1st of the year following the designation.

QOF Renewal. Similarly, new QOFs will be established with respect to newly designated QOZs. Investors in QOFs will be able to defer capital gains for up to five years. In addition, taxpayers will receive a partial basis step-up in their investment if their holding period is at least five years and recognize no gain if their holding period is between 10 and 30 years.

Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Gain Exclusion (Section 1202)

Holding Period. Non-corporate taxpayers can exclude from taxable income gain on the disposition of QSBS if such stock was held for five years and certain other requirements are satisfied. The OBBBA changes the holding-period requirement for QSBS issued after July 4, 2025 to allow a 50 percent exclusion for QSBS held for three years, a 75 percent exclusion after four years and full exclusion after five years.

Cap Increases. For QSBS issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the maximum gain that can be excluded from the disposition of QSBS of a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million. In addition, the maximum gross asset threshold for a C corporation to be a qualified small business increased from $50 million to $75 million. The increased amounts are indexed for inflation for subsequent years. These changes apply to QSBS issued after July 4, 2025.

Clean Energy Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production and Investment Credits (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Wind and Solar. The OBBBA phases out the Section 45Y and 48E credits for wind and solar projects. Wind and solar projects that begin construction on or after July 5, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit. Wind and solar projects that begin construction prior to July 5, 2026 are eligible for the Section 45Y or 48E credit under the rules that existed prior to the passage of the OBBBA.

Fuel Cells. The OBBBA adds qualified fuel cell property to the property eligible for the Section 48E credit at a 30 percent rate. Fuel cell projects are not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or the zero greenhouse gas emissions rate requirement. Fuel cell projects are not eligible for any credit adders.

Other Technologies. The OBBBA modifies the phase-out rules under Sections 45Y and 48E for non-wind and non-solar projects. For any such projects that begin construction in 2034 and 2035, the Section 45Y and 48E credits are subject to a 25 percent and 50 percent reduction, respectively. Any such projects that begin construction in 2036 or later will not qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit.

Domestic Content Adder. The OBBBA makes the domestic content percentage requirements under Section 48E consistent with those under Section 45Y for projects that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025. Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, the domestic content percentage requirement under Section 48E was 40 percent but under Section 45Y ranged from 40 percent to 55 percent depending on when construction began.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

Extension. The Section 45Z credit is extended by two years to include transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2029.

Feedstock. After December 31, 2025, transportation fuel must be exclusively derived from feedstock that is produced or grown in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

Emissions Rate. The emissions rate for a transportation fuel may not be less than zero; however, an exception allows negative emissions rates for fuels derived from animal manure. Further, the emissions rate shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use changes. Such amendments apply to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The value of the Section 45Z credit for sustainable aviation fuel is reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 for each gallon produced after December 31, 2025.

No Double Counting. To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must not be produced from a fuel for which the Section 45Z credit was allowable.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Rate Parity. The base credit rate for carbon oxides captured from an industrial source and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $12 to $17 per metric ton so that it is equal to the base credit rate for permanent sequestration. Similarly, in the case of direct air capture facilities, the base credit rate for carbon oxides captured and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $26 to $36 per metric ton. Such increases apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Wind Components. The Section 45X credit is terminated for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Metallurgical Coal. Metallurgical coal that is suitable for the production of steel (regardless of whether production occurs inside or outside of the United States) was added as an applicable critical mineral. This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Phase-out. The phase-out of the Section 45X credit was modified so that the credit (other than with respect to metallurgical coal) is subject to a 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent reduction in 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Section 45X credit terminates for metallurgical coal after 2029 and for other applicable critical minerals after 2033.

Battery Modules. The definition of “battery module” was changed to require each module to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.” This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Integrated Components. The OBBBA allows manufacturers to claim the Section 45X credit on multiple primary components that are integrated, incorporated or assembled into secondary components if (a) the primary components are produced in the same facility as the secondary components, (b) the secondary components are sold to unrelated persons and (c) at least 65 percent of the direct material costs to produce the secondary components are attributable to primary components that are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

Termination. The Section 45V credit is terminated for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

The OBBBA restricts taxpayers with connections to certain countries or foreign entities from claiming credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E. The FEOC rules largely relate to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (as well as certain listed foreign persons and entities, which are not discussed below). In general, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming credits under any one of the following circumstances:

The taxpayer is a “specified foreign entity.”

A specified foreign entity includes, among others, (a) the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea; (b) a citizen or national of one of those countries (provided that such person is not a U.S. citizen, national or resident); (c) an entity organized in, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; and (d) an entity owned more than 50 percent by persons described in clauses (a) through (c).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

A foreign-influenced entity includes an entity with respect to which (a) a specified foreign entity has authority to appoint board members or officers, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent of such entity, (c) multiple specified foreign entities own at least 40 percent of such entity or (d) at least 15 percent of the debt of such entity is held by specified foreign entities.

Except in the case of Sections 45Q and 45Z, a foreign-influenced entity also includes an entity that made payments to a specified foreign entity in the prior taxable year pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement (e.g., a license) that allows the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise effective control over a project or the production of any components (Specified Foreign Entity Payments).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer receives “material assistance” on a project from specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities.

A project is deemed to receive material assistance if the material assistance cost ratio for the project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The threshold percentages increase over time and range from 40 percent to 90 percent depending on the year, credit and technology. The material assistance cost ratio is computed as a fraction, with the numerator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components not manufactured by specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities, and the denominator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026 identifying total direct cost percentages attributable to manufactured products and components. Until the safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on the percentages in the domestic content safe harbor tables in IRS Notice 2025-08, certifications from suppliers regarding direct costs and certifications from suppliers stating that manufactured products and components were not manufactured or produced by a specified foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

This restriction applies to the credits under Section 45Y and 48E for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 (on a project-by-project basis) and to the Section 45X credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

In addition, if a taxpayer makes Specified Foreign Entity Payments within 10 years after a project claiming the Section 48E credit is placed in service, the full amount of the credit claimed is subject to recapture. This restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

International Tax

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) (Now “Net CFC Tested Income” (NCTI)) (Section 904)

Rate. The OBBBA modifies the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion rules such that a corporation’s effective GILTI rate will increase from 10.5 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the GILTI rate to 13.125 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Currently, a taxpayer can effectively exclude 10 percent of a controlled foreign corporation’s qualified business asset investment (QBAI) from the taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion calculation. The OBBBA eliminates this QBAI exclusion for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (Now “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (FDDEI)) (Section 250)

Rate. Similar to those modifications made to the GILTI regime, the OBBBA modifies the FDII rules such that a corporation’s effective FDII rate will increase from 13.125 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the FDII rate to 16.4 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Similar to QBAI with respect to GILTI, the OBBBA eliminates the QBAI exclusion for FDII for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) (Section 59A)

Rate. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the BEAT rate will increase from 10 percent to 10.5 percent. This change preempts the increase in the BEAT rate to 12.5 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB) makes key Trump-era tax cuts permanent, including the qualified business income deduction, increased standard deduction and reduced top individual tax rate.

The OBBB expands small business incentives like full expensing for R&D and bonus depreciation, raises reporting thresholds for 1099-Ks and independent contractors, and enhances exclusions for qualified small business stock.

This introduces new individual deductions for tips, overtime, seniors and car loan interest, while increasing the SALT deduction cap and child tax credit.

The OBBB will accelerate the expiration of major clean energy tax credits, cutting short incentives for electric vehicles, energy-efficient home improvements and residential renewable energy installations.

On July 4, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the OBBB into law. The OBBB extended or made permanent many of the tax provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which were set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The OBBB included other key tax provisions including retaliatory measures against foreign countries that enacted “unfair foreign taxes”, an increase in the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, full expensing for R&D and capital investments, enhancements to the Qualified Opportunity Zone incentives and significant modifications to the energy credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Summary of Key Provisions of the OBBB

1. Provisions Affecting Businesses

Extension and Enhancement of Deduction for Qualified Business Income

Previously, an individual who owned an equity interest in an entity treated as a partnership for tax purposes, owned shares in an S corporation or operated a business as a sole proprietorship was entitled to a deduction equal to 20% of qualified business income. This deduction was also available in the case of REIT dividends and income from a publicly traded partnership. Prior law also imposed a limitation on the deduction amount for certain taxpayers having taxable income in excess of designated “threshold amounts.” This deduction was one of the many provisions that was scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 under the TCJA.

The OBBB makes the deduction for qualified business income permanent. The OBBB also modifies the phase-in wage and investment limitation to $75,000 for non-joint returns and $150,000 for joint returns, and creates a minimum deduction of $400 for taxpayers with $1,000 or more of active qualified trade or business.

Full Expensing for Certain Business Property

Under prior law, certain taxpayers were permitted to deduct an “applicable percentage” of the cost of “qualified property” in the taxable year in which the property was acquired (often described as “Bonus Depreciation”). As originally enacted in the TCJA, the percentage of the cost of “qualified property” in the taxable year in which the property was acquired was equal to 100% with this percentage decreasing in each subsequent year (with the percentage decreasing to 20% for “qualified property” placed in service in 2026).

The OBBB extends the applicability of “bonus” depreciation for certain qualified property and reintroduces the deductible percentage “qualified property” as being 100% for property placed into service after January 19, 2025.

Full Expensing of Domestic Research and Experimental Expenditures

Under prior law, research and experimental expenditures had to be deducted over a five year period. Prior law also provided that the period for deduction was extended to 15 years for research and experimental expenditures attributable to research conducted outside of the U.S.

The OBBB changes these rules to provide that certain types of research and experimental expenditures are costs that can be immediately deducted in full in the taxable year in which they are incurred. This would apply to tax periods after December 31, 2024. The OBBB also provides for retroactively expensing R&D back to December 31, 2021 for certain small businesses meeting a “gross receipts” test. Further, for any expenditures that were paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2025, a taxpayer can elect to deduct any remaining unamortized amounts with respect to such expenditures over a one or two-year period after December 31, 2024.

Modification of Limitation on Business Interest

Under prior law, the deduction for business interest expense was subject to a limitation which, in part, was measured by 30% of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The OBBB changes this limitation so that the limitation would be measured, in part, by an amount equal to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization or depletion (EBITDA). Under the OBBB, this change would apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.

Special Depreciation Allowance for Qualified Production Property

Under prior law, owners of nonresidential real property had to depreciate the cost of such property over a 39-year period. Under the OBBB, the cost of acquiring or improving nonresidential real property that is “qualified production property” would be currently deductible.

For purposes of this proposal, the term “qualified production property” includes nonresidential real property that: (a) is used by the taxpayer as an integral part of a “qualified production activity;” (b) is placed in service in the U.S. or a U.S. possession; (c) the original use of which commences with the taxpayer; (d) the construction of which begins between January 19, 2025 and January 1, 2029; and (e) is placed in service before January 1, 2031. A “qualified production activity” is defined in the OBBB as manufacturing, production (but only of agricultural production and chemical production) or refining of a “qualified product” which is generally defined as tangible personal property.

Under the OBBB, recapture rules will apply if the use of the property changes in the first 10 years that the property is placed in service.

Permanent Renewal and Enhancement of Opportunity Zones

The TCJA created the opportunity zone provisions to create economic investment in distressed communities, which are census tracts meeting certain qualifications and designated by the government as “opportunity zones.” Under the TCJA, taxpayers could generally make qualifying investments in opportunity zones only through June 30, 2027. Under prior law, taxpayers making qualifying investments of capital gain were eligible to defer recognizing that capital gain until December 31, 2026, could get reductions in the amount of gain recognized and, if they held investments for at least 10 years, could sell those investments with no additional tax liability. The OBBB does not extend the recognition date for capital gain investments made in the original investment period — they will still be recognized on December 31, 2026.

The OBBB makes the opportunity zone program permanent. New opportunity zones will be chosen in 2026, and then every 10 years thereafter. The new law also provides for new investment periods. The first new investment period will begin on January 1, 2027 and run through 2033. After that, investment periods for specific opportunity zone designations will run from January 1, 2036 for 10 years, and new investment periods begin with years ending in six. This appears to create a “hole” from 2033-2036 when no new investments can be made. The OBBB narrows the definition of “low income community” somewhat, and so certain existing tracts would not be eligible for investments during the new investment period.

As under the TCJA, the OBBB allows investors making qualifying investments of capital gain to defer tax on capital gains invested in opportunity funds. Capital gains invested in the second round must be recognized on December 31, 2033. The OBBB also essentially provides a maximum 10% discount on the gain recognized in 2033 (and in later investment periods) based on the holding period of the investment before the recognition date. The OBBB increases that maximum discount to 30% for investments in rural opportunity zones. The most important tax benefit, allowing investors to sell their investments tax free if held for 10 years, remains. The OBBB also significantly increases reporting requirements in connection with opportunity zone investments.

Increased Dollar Limitations for Expensing of Certain Depreciable Business Assets

Under prior law, a taxpayer could, in lieu of claiming regular depreciation deductions, elect to expense the cost of certain qualifying property in the year it is acquired. The amount that could be deducted was subject to limitations.

The OBBB increases the deduction limitation from $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 for taxable years after 2024. Under the OBBB, this $2,500,000 limit is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the cost of the qualifying property placed into service exceeds $4,000,000.

Repeal of Revision to De Minimis Rules for Third Party Network Transactions

Prior law required third party settlement organizations (e.g. Venmo) to issue Form 1099-K to each payee receiving gross payments exceeding $600 for goods or services.

The OBBB raises this dollar amount threshold from $600 (regardless of the number of transactions made) to $20,000 and requires that the payee must have made at least 200 separate transactions in an applicable tax period in order to be subject to this reporting requirement. In addition, the OBBB exempts transactions that fall under this $20,000/200 transaction limitation from backup withholding.

Increase in Threshold for Requiring Information Reporting With Respect to Certain Payees

Under prior law, the threshold for reporting payments made by a business to an independent contractor or subcontractor was $600.

The OBBB increases the “reportable payments” threshold from $600 to $2,000 and provides an annual inflation adjustment for filing information returns. This provision applies to payments made after December 31, 2025.

1% Floor on Deduction of Charitable Contributions Made by Corporations

Under prior law, corporations were unable to take charitable contributions deductions to the extent that they exceeded 10% of the corporation’s taxable income. Any excess charitable contributions could be carried forward over the next five years.

The OBBB implements an additional “floor” for charitable contributions deductions made by a corporation. The OBBB provides that charitable contributions are also only deductible to the extent they exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income. Therefore, under the OBBB, deductible charitable contributions must both exceed a 1% taxable income floor in addition to being caped at 10% of the corporation taxable income. Any Charitable contributions above the 10% ceiling or, in certain circumstances, below the 1% floor may be carried forward for five years of the corporation’s taxable income.

Enforcement Provisions With Respect to COVID-Related Employee Retention Credits

The OBBB retroactively terminates the employee retention tax credit (ERTC) and prevents the IRS from paying any ERTCs claimed after January 31, 2024. Under prior law, eligible businesses could claim the credit until April 15, 2025. Under the OBBB, otherwise valid claims filed after January 31, 2024 will be denied.

The OBBB also extends the statute of limitations to six years for the IRS to audit and potentially make adjustments or denials to ERTC claims, giving the IRS an additional three years to audit such ERTC claims.

The OBBB also adds new penalty provisions for ERTC promoters for failing to comply with due diligence requirements or for aiding and abetting the understatement of tax liability.

Expansion of Qualified Small Business Stock Gain Exclusion

Under prior law, noncorporate taxpayers could exclude 100% of the gain on the sale or exchange of “qualified small business stock” (QSBS) held for more than five years for stock acquired after September 27, 2010. QSBS acquired in earlier years is eligible for either a 50% or 75% gain exclusion. There was a limitation on the amount that could be excluded by the seller of such stock of the greater of $10,000,000 (half of that for married filing separate returns) or 10 times the basis of the stock disposed of by the taxpayer. Further, stock would not qualify as QSBS if the corporation had “aggregate gross assets” greater than $50 million.

The OBBB loosens several of these restrictions to make the exclusion more accessible. First, it introduces a “tiered” exclusion timeline. Specifically, QSBS held for three years is eligible for a 50% gain exclusion, QSBS held for four years is eligible for a 75% gain exclusion and QSBS held for five or more years is subject to a 100% exclusion. Further, the per-issuer limitation is increased from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000, with an annual inflation adjustment (or half of these amounts for married filing separate returns). Last, the aggregate gross asset limit is increased from $50 million to $75 million, with an annual inflation adjustment.

2. Provisions Affecting Individuals, Small Businesses and Universities

Extension of Modification of Rates

The OBBB permanently reduces the highest tax bracket to 37% and provides for inflation adjustments for the 10%, 12% and 22% tax brackets.

Extension of Increased Standard Deduction and Temporary Enhancement

The OBBB permanently increases the standard deduction, which was nearly doubled by the TCJA. For 2025, the standard deduction is $15,750 for single filers, $23,625 for heads of household and $31,500 for married individuals filing jointly. For years after 2025, these amounts will be adjusted annually for inflation.

Termination of Deduction for Personal Exemptions

The OBBB permanently repeals the deduction for personal exemptions. The TCJA suspended the personal exemption deduction, which previously allowed taxpayers to claim a deduction for themselves and their dependents.

Limitation On Individual Deductions for Certain State and Local Taxes, Etc.

Under prior law, individuals were subject to a limitation on the amount of deduction that they could take for state and local taxes. In general, this deduction was capped at $10,000 under prior law ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The OBBB increases the limitation on individual deductions for SALT from $10,000 to $40,000 (and half of that amount for a married taxpayer filing a separate return).

Under the OBBB, this limitation amount is subject to a 30% phase out where the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income is over $500,000 for 2025, $505,000 for 2026 and after 2026 101% of the dollar amount in effect the preceding calendar year (or, for married filing separately, half of this amount). The OBBB prohibits the phase out from reducing the amount of the allowable deduction to be below $10,000.

Extension Of Increased Child Tax Credit

The OBBB permanently increases the child tax credit to $2,200 per child, which will be adjusted annually for inflation after 2025. It is also notable that the OBBB maintains and expands upon the requirement that a child’s social security number (SSN) and the taxpayer’s SSN, and spouse’s SSN for joint filers, be included on the return in order to claim the credit.

Extension of Increased Estate and Gift Tax Exemption Amounts and Permanent Enhancement.

The OBBB permanently increases the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million for single filers and $30 million for joint filers. The exemption amounts will be indexed for inflation.

Extension of Limitation on Deduction for Qualified Residence Interest

The OBBB permanently reduces the available home mortgage interest deduction, which was reduced from $1 million in home mortgage acquisition cost to the first $750,000 under the TCJA.

Termination of Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions

The OBBB permanently eliminates certain miscellaneous itemized deductions. Prior to the TCJA, individuals were permitted to take deductions for certain expenses such as unreimbursed employee expenses.

No Tax on Tips

Under the OBBB, taxpayers are allowed an above-the-line deduction for “qualified tips” received during the taxable year. Qualified tips are cash tips the taxpayer receives in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips. Qualified tips only include amounts that are (i) paid voluntarily, not negotiated and determined by the payer; (ii) not received in a specified service trade or business as defined in I.R.C. Section 199A(d)(2); and (iii) not otherwise limited by the regulations.

The deduction for qualified tips is limited to $25,000. The deduction phases out for joint filers with adjusted gross income over $300,000 ($150,000 for other filers).

No Tax on Overtime

Under the OBBB, taxpayers are allowed an above-the-line deduction equal to the amount of overtime compensation paid in excess of taxpayer’s regular pay rate. Qualified overtime compensation does not include qualified tips.

The deduction for qualified overtime compensation is limited to $12,500 ($25,000 for joint returns). The deduction phases out for joint filers with adjusted gross income over $300,000 ($150,000 for other filers).

Enhanced Deductions for Seniors

The OBBB provides an additional above-the-line deduction for seniors (taxpayers aged 65 or older) of $6,000 per eligible filer, reduced (but not below zero) by 6% for adjusted gross income exceeding $75,000 ($150,000 married filing jointly).

No Tax on Car Loan Interest

The OBBB creates an above-the-line deduction up to $10,000 for amounts incurred relating to qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during the taxable year. The amount of deductible qualified passenger vehicle loan interest is subject to a phase-out when the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 ($200,000 married filing jointly). Deductible interest only applies to applicable passenger vehicles. Applicable passenger vehicles are vehicles which (i) have an original use that commences with the taxpayer; (ii) are manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads and highways; (iii) have at least 2 wheels; (iv) are a car, minivan, van, SUV, pickup truck or motorcycle; (v) are treated as a motor vehicle for purposes of title II of the Clean Air Act; (vi) have a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds; and (vii) the final assembly occurs in the United States.

Modification of Excise Tax on Investment Income of Certain Private Colleges and Universities

Previously, applicable educational institutions were subject to tax in an amount equal to 1.4% of the institution’s net investment income. The OBBB implements a tiered system, implementing a tax rate equal to an “applicable percentage.” Under OBBB, the applicable percentage ranges from 1.4% to 8% based on the institutions’ “student adjusted endowment.”

For purposes of the OBBB, student adjusted endowment is equal to the aggregate fair market value of the institution’s assets (not including those directly used in carrying out the institution’s exempt purpose), divided by the daily average number of full-time students attending the institution. Under the OBBB, an applicable educational institution must have at least 3,000 tuition paying students, rather than 500 under prior law.

3. Cutbacks to Renewable Energy Based Tax Credits

Termination of Clean Vehicle Credit

Under prior law, taxpayers could claim a tax credit in an amount up to $7,500 for clean new vehicles placed in service in a given taxable year. The credit is currently set to expire on December 31, 2032. The OBBB accelerates the credit’s expiration date to September 30, 2025.

Termination of Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit

Under prior law, taxpayers could claim a tax credit for household energy efficient improvements equal to 30% of the value of such improvements. The credit is currently set to expire on December 31, 2032. The OBBB accelerates the credit’s expiration date to December 31, 2025.

Termination of Residential Clean Energy Credit

Under prior law, taxpayers could claim a tax credit for residential expenditures of certain renewable energy property equal to 30% of the value of such improvements. The credit is currently set to expire in 2034. The OBBB accelerates the credit’s expiration date to December 31, 2025.

Termination of New Energy Efficient Home Credit

Under prior law, taxpayers could claim a tax credit for homes built that met certain Energy Star standards. The credit is currently set to expire on December 31, 2032.

According to CoBank, initial guidance issued in January has allowed some biofuel producers to start monetizing the 45Z credit, but has not created enough margin improvement to offset the elimination of the $1 blender’s tax credit.","CoBank’s latest quarterly research report, released July 10, highlights current uncertainty around the implementation of three biofuel policies, including Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs), small refinery exemptions (SREs) and the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit.

The report calls the three policy matters “the three legs that will be balancing the biofuels industry as the year progresses,” noting that uncertainty regarding the implementation of each of the three policies “will greatly impact overall supply and demand.”

The EPA’s proposed rule to set 2026 and 2027 RFS RVOs includes provisions that would create a fundamental change in the RFS program by reducing the number of renewable identification numbers (RINs) generated for each gallon of fuel made from imported feedstocks by 50%. The proposed rule also includes strong RVOs for biomass-based diesel. As a result, CoBank predicts that the use of soybean oil feedstock will increase significantly.

Biofuel production has been down during the first half of the year. If RIN generation does not pick up during the second half of 2025, CoBank predicts the market will be short nearly 2 billion RINs. That shortfall doesn’t account for the impact of SREs. Some clarity should be available this fall, as CoBank notes the EPA has signaled its intent to issue decisions on outstanding SREs and promulgate a final RFS rulemaking by the end of October.

CoBank also discussed the potential impact of the 45Z credit, which was altered and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. The bill extended the credit through the end of 2029, lowered the maximum value of the credit from $1.75 to $1 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuels, limits the applicability of the credit to fuels made from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and excludes indirect land use change (ILUC) from carbon intensity (CI) calculations. According to CoBank, initial guidance issued in January has allowed some biofuel producers to start monetizing the 45Z credit, but has not created enough margin improvement to offset the elimination of the $1 blender’s tax credit.

These facilities, all of which use pulverized coal (PC) technology can be easily modified to burn wood pellets.","A whitepaper published by FutureMetrics on June 23 explains how an executive order on wildfire mitigation signed by President Donald Trump could boost the production of wood pellets for use in domestic power production.

The executive order, signed by Trump on June 12, focuses on wildfire prevention and response and includes language aimed at finding innovative uses of woody biomass and forestry products. FutureMetrics’ whitepaper offers a strategy for using the woody biomass that would be created as part of wildfire mitigation efforts.

The whitepaper explains that the June 12 executive order is expected to result in a significant increase in forest thinnings, a low-grade material that has traditionally been utilized by the paper, packaging and tissue markets. These low-grade biomass markets are already oversupplied and will not be able to absorb additional material created by expanded wildfire mitigation efforts. As a result, “innovated uses” for that material must be found. FutureMetrics’ whitepaper demonstrates how utilizing that material for wood pellet production could benefit both wildfire mitigation efforts and domestic power production.

The strategy focuses on “the production of upgraded coal-replacement solid fuel derived from the byproducts of the forest fire mitigation efforts.” The resulting wood pellets could be fired at existing coal-fired power plants, reducing emissions while maintaining baseload power.

“Not only can this strategy be used to supply utility power grids with steady non-intermittent, on-demand, and frequency stabilizing power, but in some cases datacenters that are sensitive to the carbon impacts of their power consumption can be built near to the power station and can be supplied direct ‘inside-the-fence’ steady and reliable power produced from renewable fuel,” according to the whitepaper.

According to FutureMetrics, the U.S. currently has 532 coal-fired power generation units with capacities of at least 150 megawatts (MW). These facilities, all of which use pulverized coal (PC) technology can be easily modified to burn wood pellets.

FutureMetrics estimates 28 of those coal-fired power plants are less than 15 years old. If each of those facilities was modified to cofire 15% pellets, it would create 9 million metric tons of domestic wood pellet demand.

While the strategy described by FutureMetrics would help create a market for the low-value biomass material created as part of expanded wildfire mitigation efforts, the whitepaper stresses additional action would be required of policymakers to make the strategy a reality. This includes financial support to help cover the costs of harvesting and transporting woody biomass and a mandate that would require certain coal-fired facilities to cofire biomass.

Cofiring wood pellets would not only support the goals of the executive order, FutureMetrics notes it would also spur billions of dollars of investments into new manufacturing facilities in areas of the U.S. that need industry and jobs.

Africa’s renewable capacity increased only 7.2% in 2024, half the global average growth rate, capturing just 1.57% of global capacity.

Sub-Saharan Africa must triple its renewable capacity by 2030 to meet energy access needs and climate goals, but current progress risks leaving it behind.

The world aims to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. However, the current pace remains too slow, especially in Africa, where accelerating solar and wind deployment is critical to achieving universal electricity access.

In 2024, global renewable capacity jumped by a historic 582 gigawatts (GW). Still, the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) latest ""Renewable Energy Statistics 2025"" report shows the world falls short of the COP28 target. The planet’s capacity grew from 3,860 GW in 2023 to 4,442 GW in 2024, a 15.1% increase. Yet, at this rate, the world will reach only 10.3 terawatts (TW) by 2030, missing the 11.2 TW goal. IRENA warns the world must sustain an average annual growth of 16.6% to close this gap.

Africa lags behind even more. The continent’s renewable capacity rose from 65 GW to 69.9 GW in one year, a 7.2% increase—just half the global average. Consequently, Africa held only 1.57% of global renewable capacity in 2024. Meanwhile, Asia captured 71% of new installations, driven largely by solar power, a resource Africa has in abundance.

The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) report ""COP28 Tripling Renewable Capacity Pledge"" highlights the scale of the challenge. Sub-Saharan Africa must reach 166 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030. This requires multiplying its current base by 3.2. At the current pace, the region risks falling behind, threatening its share in the global energy transition and its ability to reduce a massive electricity deficit.

Nearly 565 million people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack electricity, according to the World Bank. Deploying renewable solutions, especially decentralized solar power, is essential to close this gap.

Tripling global renewable capacity by 2030 is more than a number. It is a vital step to limit climate warming, strengthen energy security, and create sustainable jobs. For Africa, the challenge is even more urgent because of its climate vulnerability and energy shortfall. Without a coordinated and accelerated effort, this goal will remain out of reach, and the global energy transition will not be fair or inclusive.

Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada.
Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium prices soared to nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022, before hitting around $9,000 per tonne this July.
The revenue split between the two commodities is roughly 70% lithium and 30% boron, providing a potential hedge when lithium prices drop.
Ioneer has experience with lithium volatility, having built similar projects during periods of lower lithium prices, Rowe said.","A proposed lithium-boron mine in Nevada has been delayed for a second time amid a lithium price crash caused by softer electric vehicle demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally.

Earlier this month, Australian-based mining developer Ioneer Corp. agreed to delay initial construction on their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County until at least March 2026, according to a stipulated agreement.

The updated timeline comes after Ioneer lost its biggest investor in February when South Africa-based Sibanye-Stillwater scrapped its planned $490 million investment in the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.

Low lithium prices have forced a raft of companies to pause or delay spending on projects from Quebec to South Carolina and Argentina to Australia.

Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium prices soared to nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022, before hitting around $9,000 per tonne this July. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile in 2025.

Despite the construction delay, Ioneer said the company is still expecting production to start in 2028, following a three-year construction period once the company makes a final investment decision to green light the project.

That final decision will also depend on Ioneer finding an equity partner to replace the capital lost when Sibanye-Stillwater pulled out of the mine’s development.

Last month, Ioneer formally began the search for an equity partner capable of supporting an accelerated development timeline and advancing lithium-boron production at the mine. The search is expected to take four to five months, according to Ioneer.

“We’re talking to many, many different companies who have an interest in this project because of its lithium, because of its boron, and because it’s in the United States,” said Ioneer Managing Director Bernard Rowe.

Earlier this year, Ioneer also secured a $996 million federal loan from the Department of Energy following federal approval of the mine.

Volatility in the lithium market will not deter investment or the eventual construction of the Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project, said Rowe, adding that the project’s unique attributes and low-cost structure make it an attractive project.

Rhyolite Ridge in Nevada is one of the only two major known global deposits of lithium-boron. Boron is a mineral used in everything from glass to medicine to cleaning products. If constructed, it would be the first new boron mine in the U.S. in nearly a century. The revenue split between the two commodities is roughly 70% lithium and 30% boron, providing a potential hedge when lithium prices drop.

Ioneer estimates the cost of production at the mine at about $5,200 per ton of lithium after factoring in revenue from the boron produced at the mine, placing production costs in the lowest quartile of the global lithium cost curve.

Ioneer has experience with lithium volatility, having built similar projects during periods of lower lithium prices, Rowe said. Specific project economics rather than industry-wide conditions determine viability, he added.

“There’s very logical reasons why there is volatility. It’s because it’s a small market that’s growing rapidly, and it’s easy to get a mismatch, to either have too much supply or not enough. It’s very easy for that to happen when you’re dealing with a very small, but rapidly growing market like lithium,” Rowe said.

Simon Jowitt, the state geologist for the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology at UNR, said lithium mines that sustain low production costs can cope with lower prices. He pointed to Albemarle Corp.’s Silver Peak Mine in Clayton Valley, which has remained active since the 1950s due to its ability to sustain low production costs.

Getting to that point will be more difficult for mines that haven’t broken ground yet, said Jowitt. Construction is the most expensive period for a mining operation and requires significant capital expenditure without immediate returns. That can lead to companies pulling out of projects during drops in lithium price while investors look at more price-stable metals like gold, silver, and copper.

“We’ve seen this low lithium price impact development and slow development of lithium operations, and actually seeing some mines shutting down in Australia and other countries,” said Jowitt.

“The mines that are under construction are likely to wait until they see a rebound in the lithium price,” he added.

An Ioneer study released in June also quadrupled Rhyolite Ridge’s potential lithium-boron reserves from 60 million tonnes in 2020 to 247 million tonnes, sharply increasing both the project’s mine life and its development cost.

The reserve boost extends the expected mine life to 95 years, up from 26 years outlined in the company’s 2020 feasibility study and increases capital expenditure by more than doubled to $1.67 billion, up from around $800 million.

A longer life span could also prove vital. Despite current volatility, mining companies and analysts anticipate that demand for lithium will rise over the next decade due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage technologies.

While it’s difficult to predict future lithium prices, Jowitt said analysts expect lithium prices to become less volatile as the market matures, but that will take time and depends on demand for lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles.

A recent U.S. Geological Survey analysis found that about 87% of global lithium production goes into batteries, and the vast majority of those batteries are for electric vehicles.

However, in the near-to-medium term, production cuts may be necessary to stabilize prices and rebalance the market.

“Over the next 30 years, we are going to see a significant increase in demand for lithium, and you can say that for a wide variety of different commodities due to increasing electrification and so on. But 30 years is too long a period to actually base any development decisions on,” Jowitt said.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-07-14 21:06:08.082921

It’s hard to overstate what Panasonic’s investment means to Kansas and the value of the partnership that made it possible.”","KANSAS CITY, Mo. — On Monday morning, Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd., opened its new cylindrical lithium-ion battery factory for electric vehicles in De Soto, Kansas, marking one of the largest automotive battery plants in the United States.

The grand opening is scheduled for Monday, and according to the company, the factory has already begun the mass production process of 2,170 cells, with an annual production goal of about 32 gigawatt hours (GWh).

“This is the largest factory we’ve ever built in our 107-year history, and for Kansas, it’s the biggest investment they have ever had,” said Allan Swan, President and COO, Panasonic Energy Corporation of North America. “You add those two together, and you get two pretty excited groups that we are all here in De Soto.”

“So we actually moved into production last Monday. All week, we’ve been running, and today we’re running, as you can see. It’ll take another 4 to 6 weeks before we get it to the customer. We do a lot of extensive checks, so we’ve got to do all of that first, and then we’ll get them to our customers,” Swan explained.

The site itself spans about 300 acres (or 225 American football fields) and represents Panasonic Energy’s goal of accelerating U.S. production and advancing the electric vehicle industry in both Japan and North America.

Despite being the second production site in the region — with the first being in Nevada — the new facility aims to significantly boost nationwide production from 41 GWh to about 73 GWh once it’s fully operational.

The Kansas factory is expected to be about 20% more productive compared to the Nevada facility. Additionally, it will bring about 8,000 total jobs, including those in supplier and related industries, for the state, as well as 16,500 construction jobs, according to an independent Wichita State University economic impact study.

So far, the company has filled 1100 of the roughly 4,000 jobs it’s projected to create.

“Thank you for recognizing the value of who we are. Hard work, the desire to work, motivation, and skill sets that we have and are developing every day in our universities, technical colleges, and community colleges. This investment is a bright, bright indication of what Kansans have to achieve and what Kansans will have to offer the rest of the world,” said U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) during the opening ceremony.

The company announced that it will also be partnering with the University of Kansas to “promote long-term industry-academia partnerships focused on technological advancement and specialized talent development,” as well as contributing to De Soto and Kansas’ economic growth.

“The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States. This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas,” CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said.

“Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains, and nurturing the next generation of battery talent. This facility represents not only our commitment to the region but also a foundation for long-term collaboration and innovation in the U.S.”

Gov. Laura Kelly said that the De Soto plant has already hired about 1,000 staff and that it is expected to bring about $2.5 billion annually to the state of Kansas.

“Panasonic’s state-of-the-art EV battery plant marks a bright new era in Kansas,” Gov. Kelly said.

“The monumental effort that has gone into every aspect of this project has culminated in this historic day as the plant begins mass production of EV batteries. It’s hard to overstate what Panasonic’s investment means to Kansas and the value of the partnership that made it possible.”",https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-084901.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-14 22:08:20.760390

This bill would go even further and impose deep budget cuts on those critical agencies that we all depend on, along with policy riders that include industry handouts and a strange preoccupation with culture war issues that seek to divide us.

WASHINGTON — During today’s Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee markup of the 2026 funding bill, House Democrats exposed how the bill increases costs for American households, undermines infrastructure investments, and weakens our national security.

The bill:

Increases energy costs, jeopardizes energy independence, and hurts United States’ competitiveness by slashing the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs nearly in half, revoking more than $5 billion from the Department of Energy’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources, and eliminating funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Weakens national security and leaves Americans more vulnerable to nuclear threats by cutting the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account by 17 percent.

Abandons commitments to communities to clean up radioactive waste by eliminating funding for the Corps of Engineers’ Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program and cutting the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management by 9 percent.

From Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member Marcy Kaptur’s (D-OH-09) opening remarks:

“Sadly, this Republican Energy and Water bill does not meet our nation’s imperative for the future. America must become energy independent in perpetuity. This bill fails to address the cost-of-living crisis and instead will result in higher energy bills for families and businesses. China is investing record levels in energy, but this bill retreats from US global leadership in the future clean energy economy. America can and must do better. America’s future relies on the new age frontiers of energy and water.”

From Appropriations Committee Ranking Rosa DeLauro’s (D-CT-03) opening remarks:

“Energy demand is higher than ever and only increasing. Cheap, reliable energy is the basis of a modern economy. We have to increase energy supply or costs will continue to rise for the American people – and we will be dependent on importing energy to meet our goals. Instead of focusing on ways to help lower energy costs, House Republicans are using this bill to further gut critical federal resources and advance their own agenda...I cannot support this bill. Instead of working with Democrats to lower prices and invest in technology that promotes our energy independence, House Republicans are pushing a bill that raises energy costs for families and businesses and eliminates good-paying jobs. We can and must come together to improve this bill to help lower costs and support our country’s energy independence and national security.”

According to new numbers from global research firm Rho Motion, 9.1 million EVs were sold worldwide in the first half of 2025, up 28% compared to the same period last year. But not every region is accelerating at the same pace.

China and Europe are doing the heavy lifting

More than half of the world’s EVs this year have been bought in China. That market hit 5.5 million sales in the first six months of 2025 – a 32% jump year-over-year. Around half of new cars bought in China are now electric.

While some Chinese cities’ subsidies have dried up, Rho Motion expects momentum to pick back up later in the year as more funding is released.

In Europe, 2 million EVs were sold in the first half of the year, up 26%. Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales also rose 26%, thanks in part to affordable models like the Renault 4 (pictured) and 5 entering the market. Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) weren’t far behind, growing 27% year-to-date. Chinese automakers are leaning into PHEVs as a way to work around the EU’s new tariffs on BEVs.

Spain is leading the pack with EV sales soaring 85% so far this year. Its generous MOVES III incentive program was extended in April and has kept sales strong. The UK and Germany are also seeing solid growth – 32% and 40%, respectively. France, however, is slumping. With subsidies cut, EV sales there have dropped 13%.

North America is stuck in the slow lane

Things aren’t looking quite as bright in North America. EV sales in the US, Canada, and Mexico are up just 3% so far this year.

Mexico is the one bright spot, with a 20% boost. The US is up 6%. But Canada is down a whopping 23%.

And things could get bumpier. On July 4, Trump signed Congress’s big bill into law, which axes all the Inflation Reduction Act EV tax credits. Those consumer credits for EVs now officially end on September 30.

Just over half of the EVs sold in the US this year qualified for those credits. Rho Motion predicts a rush in Q3 before the subsidies disappear – and a decline in sales after that.

Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said, “With Trump’s latest cuts in his ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ the US could struggle to see any growth in the EV market overall in 2025.”

Some experts warn that President Trump’s repeal of Biden-era green energy programs could make “blackouts” in California and beyond a reality.
“The power plants that the President seems to prefer — natural gas power plants, coal, nuclear — they all take 5 to 15 years to build.
But it’s like there’s now a culture war in energy, where we have Republican, Democratic forms of energy,” said Webber.
“If we can’t build power plants fast enough, we cannot build the AI centers fast enough — then we will lose that leadership to China or someone else.","For years, President Donald Trump has said California regularly suffers from blackouts and brownouts, blaming them on the clean energy policies championed by the state’s Democratic officer-holders.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office says those claims are inaccurate.

“The state has not experienced any rotating outages since 2020 – and in the last three years, no Flex Alert calling to conserve power has even been issued,” said Deputy Communications Director Daniel Villaseñor.

“Not only has our grid been increasingly resilient, it’s also cleaner than ever — clean energy met 100% of demand on our grid for at least some part of the day almost every day this year.”

On Monday, the state touted that 67% of California’s retail electricity sales came from zero-carbon, clean generation in 2023. That’s up from 41% a decade ago. So far this year, according to the governor’s office, California’s grid has run on 100% clean electricity for an average of seven hours a day.

The last time the state had rotating outages was Aug. 14 and 15, 2020. Those lasted 20 to 30 minutes at a time, according to Severin Borenstein, the director of the Energy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.

“These two rotating outages often get played up as some crisis, and it’s certainly not something we want to have. But compared, for instance, to what happened in Texas in 2021 when Winter Storm Yuri came through and vast parts of the state lost power for many, many days and over 200 people died, nothing like that occurred,” Borenstein explained.

The president’s sweeping tax and spending agenda rolls back tax credits for clean energy production that were part of President Joe Biden’s signature climate and health care law, called the Inflation Reduction Act.

Some experts warn that President Trump’s repeal of Biden-era green energy programs could make “blackouts” in California and beyond a reality.

“I think the risks of blackouts — or the risks of outages — will go up because of the bill, because the bill makes it more expensive and difficult to build the power plants we need to maintain the grid,” said Michael Webber, a professor who studies clean energy at the University of Texas at Austin.

Webber warned that cutting tax credits to renewable energy endeavors makes it more likely to have shortages in the coming years. “That’s a real problem,” he said. “The power plants that the President seems to prefer — natural gas power plants, coal, nuclear — they all take 5 to 15 years to build. Wind and solar we can build in the next two years. And so if we’re not going to be able to build those as easily, then we might have a shortfall.”

Both Webber and Borenstein agreed that clean energy has become a polarizing topic under both the first and second Trump administrations, and that the rollback of these incentives are just the latest example.

“If you look at where the clean energy systems are built, in particular, like wind, solar and batteries, it’s in rural Republican districts, and so it’s mostly Republican members of Congress whose districts benefit financially from the development of these options, and so economically, it’s quite good in a bipartisan way, and environmentally, it’s quite good in a bipartisan way. But it’s like there’s now a culture war in energy, where we have Republican, Democratic forms of energy,” said Webber. “It makes no sense.”

“In today’s partisan world, Trump is insisting that all the Republicans fall in line. So…they voted for things that are against the entrance of their own constituents,” added Borenstein. “Unfortunately, the current administration is just not interested in directly recognizing that that’s what’s causing climate change, that the world is burning a lot of fossil fuels, and we need to move away from that in order to address climate change.”

Harrison Fields, a spokesman for the White House defended the rollback of federal clean energy tax credits, telling Spectrum News that “President Trump and the nearly 80 million Americans who supported his America First energy agenda are not interested in advancing scam energy industries that embolden our adversaries, stifle domestic energy production, and raise prices for countless Americans.”

“The President’s [One Big Beautiful Bill] is a complete overhaul of the Biden administration’s slush fund for the Green New Deal lobby and will further unleash the might of America’s energy dominance while continuing to lower costs for millions of families,” added Fields, though he did not directly address our inquiry about the president’s repeated false claims about California’s energy resiliency.

Borenstein suggested the president continues to repeat it because “it helps him to push the narrative that California is failing.”

“The narrative that California is hell bent on going with renewables, no matter how much it costs and how much it undermines reliability is very useful to him. It’s just inaccurate. California’s generation costs for electricity are not very high. California’s generation costs for electricity are about comparable with the rest of the Western United States, and California’s reliability is in the middle of the pack. So it is simply not the case that California is an outlier on either of those California does have very, very high electricity prices. And primarily the difference is because California is dealing with things that climate change has already done to us, that is primarily wildfires and the cost of preventing wildfires, and that’s just dealing with reality any state that has these sorts of natural disaster problems, is going to have to pay for it.”

When pressed about the President’s claims that both California officials and experts dispute, a White House official pointed Spectrum News to an article from the San Francisco Chronicle from this past weekend, where roughly 7,200 customers experienced a power outage. They also flagged an instance last summer in which PG&E warned customers they may need to shut off power for a time to limit the potential for a wildfire.

California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner told Spectrum News the state plans to forge ahead with its clean energy transition “with or without the support of the federal government.”

“As the fourth-largest economy in the world, California’s standing demonstrates the economic strength of our approach. In the meantime, we encourage all Californians to take advantage of federal incentives to purchase new and used electric vehicles, before they expire,” she said in a statement. The tax break for individuals who buy new or used electric vehicles will expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032, as was originally the plan.

Webber also raised the concern that a lack of energy resiliency could result in national security concerns, particularly in the race for artificial intelligence.

“If we can’t build power plants fast enough, we cannot build the AI centers fast enough — then we will lose that leadership to China or someone else. And I think that is bad for our national security,” argued Webber. “What I think is fascinating is [that] President Trump has really made AI dominance a national priority, at least rhetorically, like he says we need to win the AI race, but then making it harder to build power plants sets us up to lose that race. So there’s a mismatch there between the national security imperative to be the world leader on artificial intelligence, yet make it hard to build the power plants we need to be the world leader on artificial intelligence.”

General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution plan to add more battery production lines at their joint venture plant in Tennessee to make lower-cost cells starting in late 2027, the companies said in a statement July 14. The amount of the investment was not disclosed.

The Ultium Cells plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., will begin to make lower-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries, or LFP, in addition to more-expensive and longer-range nickel-based batteries. The new LFP batteries will enable GM to make more lower-priced electric vehicles.

The news comes as most automakers are pulling back on electric vehicle investments in the U.S. market. EV sales in the U.S. have slowed and President Donald Trump’s tax bill cuts the $7,500 federal tax incentive for battery-powered models in September.

But GM remains committed to EVs. After spending $35 billion to develop its Ultium battery platform and a dozen models, CEO Mary Barra sees electric drive as the long-term future and a near-term way to win over buyers as other automakers back off.

In the first half of the year, GM’s EV sales more than doubled to more than 78,000 as its $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV sold near 28,000. This is the low-priced EV’s first year of full production.

GM may be a lone bright spot in the market. In the first half of the year, US EV sales hit a record of 607,000 but declined in the second quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. Tesla Inc. sales are on pace for their second annual decline.

Barra hired former Tesla Inc. executive Kurt Kelty to rethink GM’s battery strategy. With him running the energy storage operations, GM has invested in LFP technology, different cell shapes that can store more energy on board and another chemistry called lithium manganese rich batteries that the company believes will lower EV costs and give drivers satisfactory driving range.

-As Prepared For Delivery-

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here with you as we mark up the Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Development bill. Chairman Fleischmann, I appreciate working with you, and our colleagues, to develop and pass bipartisan bills, as has long been this committee’s practice. I am truly saddened that this vital subcommittee is being steered yet again to return to a partisan process for this Fiscal Year 2026 House bill.

I would like to thank our diligent staff for all their hard work on this bill. From the Minority staff, Scott McKee, Anisha Singh, and Adam Wilson. And on my personal staff, Kaitlin Ulin, TJ Lowdermilk and Margaret McInnis. Thank you all.

Energy and water undergird America’s way of life. They are not optional — but essential to sustaining life.

We are reminded about our purpose — especially as related to water resource development — by the extreme flash flooding that occurred in Texas, resulting in the unnecessary and tragic loss of over 100 lives, with at least 160 missing. So many children, so many counselors, just a terrible American tragedy. Deadly West Virginia flash flooding this past month significantly damaged over 100 homes unfortunately taking the lives of at least seven people, including a nine-year-old in Valley Grove, West Virginia, and by the way, a member of our full committee represents that community. We’ve also seen flooding events in central North Carolina, and New Mexico. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims.

Let me be clear, no matter how much the members on the other side of the aisle want to pretend that the climate isn’t changing, for the record, the last 10 years are the 10 hottest in recorded history! These floods are made worse by that. We had four 1,000 year floods last week alone. Think about that.

It is our duty to prepare our communities and people.

We need to build resilient infrastructure. My home in the city of Toledo has spent billions of dollars to fund new sewers and vast underground catchment basins. We are making investments all over our district to protect the Lake Erie shoreline. And in places where infrastructure investments aren’t cost effective, we need to make sure that families will be protected with adequate warning systems!

I, for one, have brought funding for tornado sirens to my district and built a new border patrol station to protect and defend our people. We zone to prevent flooding from threatening human life.

It is our job as public servants to dedicate ourselves to addressing the structural shortcomings at the federal, state, and local level that contributed to the loss of life.

Sadly, this Republican Energy and Water bill does not meet our nation’s imperative for the future. America must become energy independent in perpetuity. In a nation of 350 million people, we must make energy cost less — especially as grid resilience is undermined.

This bill fails to address the cost-of-living crisis and instead will result in higher energy bills for families and businesses. China is investing record levels in energy, but this bill retreats from U.S. global leadership in the future diversified and clean energy economy.

This Energy and Water bill cuts $1.6 billion — or 47 percent — from the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs. These are vital to delivering clean, affordable, and secure energy to the American people — and to ensuring our nation leads, not lags, in the global race toward an affordable clean energy future.

Our dad and mom taught us how to be thrifty and not wasteful. Dad used to say, “it’s not how much you make, it’s how much you save.” Energy and fresh water conservation are good goals for the future of our children and grandchildren.

We have made great strides towards energy independence as a country. The United States is producing more oil than ever before — record-high production levels. But we are still tethered to a volatile global energy market dominated by cartels and petroleum dictators like OPEC.

China intends to be the OPEC for the next century—one which will be dominated by clean energy. More wind turbines and solar panels were installed last year than in the rest of the world combined. A Chinese company has developed an EV battery that can travel 1,800 miles in a single charge and be recharged in just five minutes.

Any bill that passes out of our Committee must not cede the energy future to China. That currently is leading both domestically and internationally.

Now, this Energy and Water bill slashes the Department of Energy’s vital programs. Why? It is all part of unfortunately some Republicans’ plan to cut programs that help all Americans so they can give more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires in the Big Billionaire Bonanza Bill. We need to focus on building an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy few.

This bill revokes $5.1 billion of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources from the Department of Energy's programs. That means US ceding the global lead in hydrogen, direct air capture, battery recycling, and energy improvements in every public and private structure.

The bill also eliminates funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. It undermines public-private partnerships that drive large-scale clean energy projects, speed deployment, and propel American industry to lead in the global clean energy economy.

In fact, US businesses have canceled more than $15 billion in investment in new factories and electricity projects here at home just this year as a result of the Bonanza for Billionaires Bill. Those canceled projects were expected to create nearly 12,000 new jobs — all gone now.

Thus, I oppose the Republicans’ cuts to vital energy production and conservation programs at the Department of Energy. Shortchanging these advances pushes our nation backwards — slow walking energy innovation and failing to modernize our nation’s energy grids.

In other areas, this bill dangerously shortchanges our national security by slashing $412 million from the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account. This effectively guts our efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, detect covert nuclear threats, and uphold arms control agreements that keep us safe. All a big gift for Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea.

Additionally, this bill turns its back on communities still living with the toxic legacy of America’s atomic past. It zeroes out funding for the Army Corps’ program to clean up radioactive waste at early nuclear sites and slashes $779 million from the Department of Energy’s nuclear cleanup efforts — delaying the cleanup these communities have been promised for decades. I’ll note for the Committee that one of these sites, in the village of Luckey, Ohio, is a very short drive from my home.

Finally, the bill includes numerous controversial poison pill policy riders that sadly show extremists among us are not interested in bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.

I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. America can and must do so much better. America’s future relies on the new age frontiers of energy and water.",https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-14 22:08:36.327387

Thank you for yielding. It is wonderful to be here with you today, Chairman Fleischmann, Chairman Cole, and Ranking Member Kaptur. Before I get started, let me share my appreciation for the subcommittee staff, especially Scott McKee, Anisha Singh, and Adam Wilson.

We have the opportunity – and the responsibility – through this subcommittee’s bill to make investments that lower energy costs for American families, promote America’s energy independence, and support American manufacturing.

Those are the President’s goals, are they not? He promised to lower costs on day one. He promised energy independence and stronger manufacturing. I support those goals – but the President has done nothing to address the cost-of-living crisis, which he is actually making worse. And the majority’s bill will only take us backwards.

I am opposed to the bill before this subcommittee because it will raise energy costs for American households and businesses, hurt our competitiveness, jeopardize our energy independence and weaken America’s national security.

Never mind the fact that we have still not received a complete budget from the White House, we are holding this markup in a completely unprecedented time, with the Congress’s authority being challenged by a lawless Administration.

Since taking office, the Trump Administration has stolen resources, appropriated by this committee, passed by Democrats and Republicans in the House and in the Senate, for programs and services across the federal government that help to grow the middle class, protect the working class, support small businesses, and make sure billionaires and corporations play by the rules and pay their fair share.

The cost-of-living crisis is felt by every American family – middle class families, working families, rural families, seniors and other vulnerable Americans.

But the president is not laser focused on the cost-of-living crisis. Instead, he put billionaires like Elon Musk in charge of the government.

This Administration has attacked and destroyed programs created by Congress and funded by the Appropriations Committee that protect our national security and help increase domestic energy production.

And among the stolen and frozen funding are dozens of programs within this bill.

Just last week, the Administration announced they are cutting investments Congress appropriated to support research and development for wind and solar energy production. That is in total defiance of the law – the full year continuing resolution, which President Trump himself signed in March.

This Administration has stolen funding from American manufacturers, canceling two dozen Department of Energy projects totaling over $3.7 billion, raising the cost of energy for families and businesses.

And they pulled the rug out from under American families and businesses when they froze home energy rebates, electric grid programs, hydrogen hubs, battery manufacturing, industrial programs, weatherization assistance, and loan programs.

All of which Congress enacted and appropriated funding for in law. They are substituting Congress’ decisions and judgment with their own, turning Article I of the Constitution on its head.

These cuts are not numbers on a page – they are not only felt in Washington, DC. They affect all of our constituents.

Just a few months ago, states across New England, including my state of Connecticut, were ready to begin an ambitious and collaborative effort to increase energy transmission capacity across our region, to build resiliency and lower energy bills.

Nearly $400 million was going to be invested through the Department of Energy’s Grid Innovation Program to provide onshore connections for offshore wind power, improve the electric grid, and install energy storage through a project called Power Up New England.

But the President’s Day One executive order abruptly halted offshore wind energy projects in their tracks, and the Department of Energy froze Power Up New England’s grant. That project was expected to bring enough energy online to power about 2 million homes, and reduce energy costs for customers by up to $1.5 billion per year.

Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, said, and I quote, “We are now having to do a fundamental reassessment on where else is large scale electricity supply growth going to come from…We are in massively uncharted territory with respect to energy policy.” End quote. The level of uncertainty and chaos now occurring is not an accident – it is a direct result of this Administration’s policies and lawlessness.

Energy demand is higher than ever and only increasing. Cheap, reliable energy is the basis of a modern economy. We have to increase energy supply or costs will continue to rise for the American people – and we will be dependent on importing energy to meet our goals.

If you listen to the President, you might believe China does not invest in wind energy. If your listen to the facts, you will know that China leads the world in wind energy production by a substantial margin – and we are only falling further and further behind.

Who will lead the clean energy future? America, or China?

This Administration – and this bill – picks the latter.

Instead of focusing on ways to help lower energy costs, House Republicans are using this bill to further gut critical federal resources and advance their own agenda.

Their cut of nearly half the budget for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is a direct attack on the programs that lower energy bills for working families, create good-paying jobs in our communities, and keep America competitive.

Their bill revokes funding that supports hydrogen energy, battery recycling, and energy improvements in public schools, as well as support for public-private clean energy projects. This is not a red state or blue state issue. All of our constituents lose when we walk away from clean, affordable, domestically-produced energy.

Their bill undermines the very programs that help us stop the spread of nuclear weapons, detect nuclear activity, and uphold arms control efforts that make America and the world safer – and it completely defunds efforts to clean up sites contaminated by our nation’s early atomic energy program. Weakening these programs at a time of growing global threats is irresponsible and dangerous, and an abandonment of American values.

All of this mere days after Republicans passed and the President signed the Big Billionaire Bailout, a law that gives massive tax breaks to billionaires and the biggest corporations while driving up home energy bills for families by as much as 30 percent.

I cannot support this bill. Instead of working with Democrats to lower prices and invest in technology that promotes our energy independence, House Republicans are pushing a bill that raises energy costs for families and businesses, and eliminates good-paying jobs.

We can and we must come together to improve this bill to help lower costs and support our country’s energy independence and national security.

Thank you, and I yield back.

Oncor, the state’s largest electric transmission and distribution company, filled an intent to increase rates in all municipalities with the Public Utility Commission of Texas on June 26. This move would increase its revenue to $834 million. June 26.

Residential customers’ bill would go up approximately $7 for those using 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month. Average use in Texas is 1,146, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The proposed increases would result in a 13% increase for cities and a 12.3% increase for streetlights.

In the filing, Oncor said that while its deadline to file a rate increase was not until 2027, it needs to adjust its rates much sooner to keep up with the state’s growth.

What are North and Central Texas cities plan to address the increase?

A committee of 170 cities served by Oncor is considering a resolution to suspend the effective date of July 31, to allow it at least 90 days to study the request and to hire legal and consulting services to negotiate on behalf of all the cities in the committee.

Memphis Light, Gas and Water (MLGW), the largest three-service municipal utility in the United States, is set to become a trailblazer by deploying the country’s first full-scale, standalone private 5G wireless network specifically for a municipal utility. Partnering with Nokia, MLGW aims to modernize and unify communications across its electric, gas, and water services, enhancing data connectivity, resilience, and operational efficiency for over 420,000 customers in Tennessee. This ambitious initiative aligns with MLGW’s long-term grid modernization strategy, aiming to reduce unplanned outages and improve power restoration times across Memphis and Shelby County.

The new private 5G network promises to facilitate real-time communication and automation across MLGW’s operations, bolstering critical applications like automated meter reading, grid monitoring, fault detection, and remote field operations. Such enhancements will support the utility’s ability to deploy more automation and smart control operations, especially crucial during severe weather or cyber events, as explained by Doug McGowen, president and CEO of MLGW. He emphasized the network’s potential to support future technologies such as electric vehicles and battery storage, highlighting its role in creating a smarter and more resilient electric grid infrastructure.

Nokia will deliver a comprehensive solution incorporating its AirScale radio access equipment and 5G Core Enterprise Solution, alongside a microwave backhaul system and dedicated towers. The deployment will also feature Nokia’s NetGuard cybersecurity measures to proactively detect and respond to threats, ensuring enhanced security and operational continuity. According to Jeff Pittman, Nokia’s head of North America enterprise mobile networks, the collaboration marks a significant milestone in MLGW’s digital transformation journey and underscores Nokia’s leadership in providing end-to-end private wireless networks for utilities.

Reflecting a broader trend

While MLGW sets a notable precedent with this standalone 5G private network, the move reflects a broader trend in the utilities sector, where private wireless technologies are rapidly being adopted to support grid modernization and sustainability agendas. For example, Southern California Edison (SCE) has also launched a private 5G Field Area Network (FAN) designed to enable real-time grid monitoring, remote asset management, and integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER). This network leverages Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum, permitting network slicing — a capability that supports prioritized network performance for latency-sensitive applications during peak demand periods. Though SCE’s network currently focuses on LTE technology with planned future upgrades to 5G, it demonstrates how private wireless networks are becoming central to modern utility operations.

Similarly, other utilities like Xcel Energy have invested in private LTE networks to enhance grid automation and integrate renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, into their grids. These networks support real-time outage response and sustainable asset utilization on a broad scale, covering multi-state service areas. Nokia’s ongoing projects with Xcel and other global utilities highlight its extensive experience – spanning over 30 years and more than 200 utilities worldwide – in delivering mission-critical communication solutions that improve operational efficiency, reliability, and safety.

5G deployments gain traction in smart city pushes

Beyond utilities, private 5G deployments are also gaining traction in smart city initiatives, as seen in Brownsville, Texas, where Nokia and NTT DATA have collaborated to build a turnkey private 5G solution. This infrastructure supports critical public safety and operational efficiency applications while enabling future scalability for urban innovation.

MLGW’s pioneering adoption of a standalone private 5G network thus marks a significant step forward in utility digital transformation, offering a model that combines high-performance connectivity, robust security, and scalability. It promises to enhance power delivery reliability, operational responsiveness, and the integration of emergent technologies, playing a vital role in shaping the future of municipal utility services in the U.S.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns.
Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years.
A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.","Millions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/07/4.-AP25191678216150.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 19:12:10.764322

Their unique chemical properties make them particularly suitable for energy technologies and irreplaceable for certain purposes. Pursuant to the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116–260), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) publishes a revised list of critical minerals every three years. The most recent list, published in 2022, categorizes 50 minerals as critical. For clarity and consistency, this issue brief will use the Energy Act definition of critical minerals, which encompasses both minerals and materials.

Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Technologies

From electric vehicles to renewable power sources, critical minerals are key to several clean energy technologies:

Batteries: Lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite are essential to the performance of batteries that power electric vehicles and enable renewable energy storage. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt, for example, extend the life of a battery and allow for greater electricity storage capacity.

Permanent magnets: Rare earth elements like neodymium and dysprosium are crucial to the composition of ultra-strong magnets that generate motion within electric vehicles and convert wind into electricity in wind turbines.

Electricity transmission: The transition to renewable energy rests largely on reliable electricity transmission and distribution. The wires and cables that underpin the electric grid are often made with aluminum.

Solar photovoltaics: Technologies that convert sunlight into electricity use aluminum, with other critical minerals coming into play depending on the specific technology.

Hydrogen production requires metals such as platinum, nickel, or iridium, among other critical materials, depending on how it is produced.

Critical Mineral Supply Chains

While the particulars vary by material, the critical mineral supply chain generally comprises exploration and discovery, extraction, processing, refining, and manufacturing.

The five steps of the critical mineral supply chain often do not occur within the same country. A producer, for example, may offshore steps of the process due to a lack of advanced processing or manufacturing infrastructure in their country, insufficient “feedstock” of critical minerals, a shortage of skilled domestic workers, price competitiveness that makes it cheaper to offshore the supply chain, or lack of interest from investors to finance domestic operations.

Minerals extracted in a producer country can be shipped to a second country for processing and refining. After refining, they can be manufactured domestically or can be exported again—back to the producer country or to a third country—for integration into an end-use product (manufacturing). Supply chains dispersed in this way are inherently susceptible to delays and geopolitical risk. Countries can mitigate these vulnerabilities by onshoring or “friend-shoring” supply chain processes wherever possible.

The United States is subject to the ebbs and flows of the global critical mineral supply chain and the countries that dominate it. In 2024, the United States relied on imports, rather than domestic production, for 100% of 12 critical minerals on the 2022 USGS list. In the same year, it had an import reliance of 50% or more for an additional 28 listed minerals. The top critical mineral exporters to the United States were China, Canada, Japan, and South Africa. The top critical mineral producers were China (for 30 of the 50 USGS critical minerals), South Africa (3), Australia (2), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2).

In recent years, the global critical mineral supply chain has been marked by long timelines for mineral extraction projects, a high reliance on a small concentration of producer and processing nations, and volatile mineral prices. Price volatility has risen from supply chain disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflict. For example, war in Ukraine has disrupted graphite and titanium production and Russian nickel exports, while China has banned exports of antimony, gallium, and germanium to the United States.

The United States has deposits of minerals and materials such as aluminum, antimony, cobalt, gallium, graphite, lithium, nickel, and several rare earth elements. Due to lengthy regulatory and permitting processes, legal battles, and cheaper overseas production, the majority of these deposits have remained in the ground. The United States produces 37 of the 50 critical minerals from mining, secondary recovery, or recycled materials. Deposits of an additional five listed minerals exist but are not mined. Twelve of the 37 (aluminum, cobalt, gallium, graphite, lithium, magnesium, nickel, platinum, and various rare earth elements) are deemed by USGS and the Department of Energy (DOE) as critical to the clean energy transition. Gallium, which increases the energy efficiency of solar photovoltaic cells, and iridium, a rare earth element used in hydrogen production, are the only clean energy critical minerals that the United States does not produce. A New York based company currently recovers gallium from scrap, while deposits of iridium exist in Alaska but are not mined.

While USGS has collected robust data on mineral production by U.S. state, data on mineral processing is nominal. However, processing is known to have occurred at U.S. facilities in 2024 for beryllium and graphite. The greatest barriers to onshoring processing and refining operations are price competitiveness, a shortage of skilled labor, and a lack of interest from investors.

A potential, though not yet commercially viable, alternative to land-based mineral production lies seaward. The seabed contains critical minerals (namely cobalt, manganese, nickel, and rare earth elements) in various forms, most predominantly as potato-sized deposits called polymetallic nodules. These accumulations of critical minerals formed over millions of years and are found in the billions across the ocean floor. The nodules can be collected by remote-operated vehicles that roam the sea floor. Deep-sea mining is governed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which distributes licenses to member governments for mineral exploration and extraction in international waters. As of July 2025, the United States is not a voting member of the ISA and therefore cannot obtain such a license.

Externalities of Critical Mineral Development

Critical mineral extraction, processing, and refining are linked to significant environmental and human health impacts. Open pit mining is the standard process around the world for extracting minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel from the Earth. According to the International Energy Agency, this energy-intensive process emits greenhouse gases; degrades surrounding lands, leading to habitat and biodiversity loss; contaminates groundwater and freshwater resources used for human consumption, crop irrigation, and livestock; and consumes immense volumes of groundwater that local communities rely on. The processing and refining of raw critical minerals into usable forms also requires high volumes of water and inputs of harmful chemicals, and leaves behind large amounts of tailings, the often-hazardous waste materials that remain after processing. These externalities directly impact communities and wildlife situated on or near mining and processing facilities, with particular impact on tribal communities. In the United States, 97% of nickel resources, 79% of lithium resources, and 68% of cobalt resources are within 35 miles of Native American reservations. Many other resources lie within or near sacred tribal sites or in areas of cultural or environmental significance to tribes.

Offshore, the ecosystem impacts of deep-sea mining are still being determined, and further research is needed to better measure the extent of harm. Past studies have found that the removal of mineral-rich nodules eliminates habitats for corals and sponges that in turn house smaller organisms, the absence of which may have ripple effects across the food chain. These studies have also found that the movements of remote-operated deep-sea mining vehicles release plumes of sediment that bury nodule fields, smother organisms, spew toxic metals, and interfere with essential functions in bioluminescent species.

According to the SAFE Center for Critical Minerals Strategy (SAFE), many mining companies around the world have a record of human rights abuses, fostered by weak or absent governance and lack of transparency. SAFE cites child and forced labor and population displacement as prevalent issues associated with mineral mining, particularly cobalt mining.

Twelve different international standards offer “best practices” for responsible mining. Developed by national governments, industries, and multi-stakeholder groups, these practices address issues including child labor and forced labor, water quality, mining waste and land reclamation, tribal engagement, and community engagement. These standards, however, are largely voluntary and lack reporting and enforcement mechanisms. The variety of these often-overlapping standards also sows confusion over which standard to sign on to, leading to inconsistencies in mining practices.

Critical Mineral Secondary Recovery and Recycling

Secondary recovery, or secondary production, refers to the recuperation of critical minerals from the tailings of the initial extraction and processing of other materials, or from discarded end-use products. This alternative to mining avoids many harmful environmental and public health impacts, conserves limited raw mineral supplies, promotes a circular economy, provides a level of resilience against supply chain disruptions, and bolsters national security.

In recent years, increased research, development, and investment has led to new methods of extracting critical minerals. For example, researchers at Oregon State University found that the brine wastewater discharged by desalinization plants across the world contains 17,400 tons of lithium. Some universities (including Oregon State), private companies, and federal agencies are now developing methodologies and technologies for recovering this lithium. A 2024 study by the University of Texas found that U.S. stockpiles of coal ash, a waste product of burning coal, contain 11 million tons of rare earth elements, worth $8.4 billion. Several U.S. National Laboratories have also explored methods of critical mineral recovery from mine tailings and brine waste.

Barriers to widespread secondary recovery remain. For one, secondary recovery is more expensive than mining raw materials. Greater technical expertise and a new and larger workforce are also needed to support the scaling-up of emerging secondary recovery techniques. As this workforce grows, it will require policies and standards to protect workers who are handling hazardous materials, such as coal ash.

Some critical minerals can, to varying degrees, be recycled for continuous reuse. The physical collection, separation, and reprocessing of scrap metal and discarded end-use materials can generate new supplies of critical minerals. The United States has recycling streams in place for at least 14 minerals, including those important in clean energy technologies such as aluminum, cobalt, gallium, magnesium, nickel, and platinum.

Domestic recycling systems for many other critical minerals are in their infancy. The lower cost of mining over recycling, gaps in research and development, limited supplies of source material (i.e., discarded products containing critical minerals), and difficulties in separating and stripping source material to extract minerals prevent recycling systems from becoming a significant and reliable source for critical minerals.

Competition for limited raw minerals and high costs of domestic mining can incentivize a shift in investment toward recycled supplies. Investment in research and development can identify ways of recycling other critical minerals for which a recycling process does not exist or is not yet scalable. The improved design and manufacturing of end-use products (e.g., using screws instead of glue during assembly) can make products easier to recycle. Finally, comprehensive policies for the collection of end-use products can help keep viable source materials in the supply chain.

Federal Efforts to Secure Critical Mineral Supplies

The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58) infused $7.9 billion over five years into battery manufacturing, primarily, as well as into critical mineral development, processing, refining, recycling, and research. The IIJA also codifies the eligibility of domestic critical mineral extraction projects for $72 billion in loan guarantees, distributed by DOE’s Loan Programs Office. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169) supported domestic critical mineral extraction, recycling, processing, and refining through billions of dollars in tax incentives—namely, the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (45X), the Clean Vehicle Credit (30D), and the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C). More than 162 bills, amendments, and resolutions on critical minerals were introduced in the 118th Congress (2023-2024).

Notable bills reintroduced in the 119th Congress as of July 2025—all boasting bipartisan support—include:

The Critical Mineral Consistency Act of 2025 (H.R.755/S.714) would increase the number of critical minerals and materials eligible for clean energy tax credits.

The Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025 (H.R.2444/S.257) would establish private-public partnerships to mitigate supply chain disruptions, including for critical minerals.

The Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act (H.R.3198/S.823) would establish a joint task force across federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to identify opportunities for increased domestic critical mineral production and recycling.

The Critical Materials Future Act of 2025 (S.596) would establish a pilot program within DOE to develop critical material processing projects in the United States.

The Unearth Innovation Act (S.598) would establish a DOE program to research, develop, and commercialize innovative critical mineral mining, processing, and recycling technologies that minimize negative environmental and human impacts.

The Critical Minerals Security Act of 2025 (S.789) would mandate a study on global critical mineral resources to help secure U.S. access to critical mineral supply chains.

The STRATEGIC Minerals Act (S.429) would leverage international partnerships and trade agreements to secure a reliable supply of critical minerals.

In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order, “Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production” (E.O. 14241). The order wields the Defense Production Act to expedite permitting processes for critical mineral mining projects on federal lands. The executive order also directs agencies to expedite the mining of copper, uranium, gold, and potash in addition to the critical minerals listed by USGS. In April 2025, President Trump signed E.O. 14285, “Unleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources,” which directs agencies to explore and extract critical minerals—both within and beyond U.S. territory—through deep-sea mining.

Federal Agencies in the Critical Mineral Mix

Due to the range of expertise needed to secure a domestic critical mineral supply, the diversity of their end-use applications, and their implications for international relations and trade, critical mineral management in the United States takes a holistic approach. The following federal agencies and offices oversee critical mineral development and security across the supply chain:

Brian Deese: Well, it suggests that the current administration has a incredible political holdover its majority.","America is choosing obstruction over abundance. While AI, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing require massive infrastructure investments, we’re trapped in a permitting system designed for a different era — and a political system that rewards blocking over building.

In this episode of Open Circuit, we’re joined by Brian Deese, former director of the National Economic Council and current MIT innovation fellow, to unpack why America’s building capacity has become our biggest competitive bottleneck.

Drawing from his Foreign Affairs piece, “Why America Struggles to Build,” Deese explains why breaking down physical infrastructure constraints could drive the next wave of economic growth.

Deese argues that 80% of project delays stem from state and local regulations, not federal policy. Using a “zero-based budgeting” approach to permitting, states could dramatically accelerate deployment of projects. Meanwhile, AI could slash the time and cost of environmental reviews from months to weeks, if regulators allow it.

We also explore the outcome of the recent GOP’s tax and spending bill, and examine why the Inflation Reduction Act’s messaging failed to create political durability. Deese argues that winning on infrastructure requires both economic arguments — jobs, wealth, and lower costs — and visceral arguments about strength, reliability, and energy security.

As Deese explains, we’re at a “unique economic moment” where AI, clean energy, and geopolitical fragmentation are converging to create unprecedented infrastructure demands. Can America overcome the politics of obstruction to build it?

Transcript

Stephen Lacey: Brian, you made it. You’ve had quite the journey.

Brian Deese: It’s been like Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride.

Stephen Lacey: Brian was delayed in joining us because he had a full-on immersive experience in America’s infrastructure challenges, spending the night at the airport.

Brian Deese: I actually spent two nights back to back, the first in O’Hare and the second in Dulles. And so it really has been Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride. For those who aren’t already aware, we have an issue of congested airspace on the eastern seaboard coupled with more extreme weather. It’s a thing. It’s a thing.

Jigar Shah: Next time, he’s got to jump in the electric vehicle.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, my brother and his wife were trying to get back from Scotland last week and they were like, “The pilot said, ‘Guess what. I found a solution,'” from landing in Dulles. “We’re going to go to Newark.” And everybody on the plane was like, “No, don’t take us to Newark.”

Stephen Lacey: It’s extreme weather and infrastructure cosplay, Brian.

Brian Deese: Perfect for your audience.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. This week, how do we solve our building bottleneck? Here’s a pretty remarkable fact. Only five companies from the 1990 Fortune 100 are still on it today. The digital era completely remade the American economy, and it was only possible because we built the physical infrastructure to support it. Today we’re at a far more radical turning point. AI, advanced computing, clean energy, and climate positive tech present even greater innovation potential. But these all require massive physical infrastructure, and America’s ability to lead in this new economy will be limited by its ability to build, yet we’re choosing obstruction over abundance.

On the left, a deference to rules and regulations has contributed to a slowdown in construction productivity, and on the right, the politics of obstruction have infested the GOP, threatening America’s industrial muscle memory just as we were building it back up. What will it take to build a real coalition that chooses building over blocking? I’m Stephen Lacey, executive editor at Latitude Media. Welcome. I am joined, as always, by Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah. They are my regular cohosts. Jigar, How’s it going?

Jigar Shah: It’s all right, it’s all right.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, how are you?

Katherine Hamilton: Doing wonderful. So happy that Brian made it to be with us.

Stephen Lacey: Last week, under pressure from the president, congressional Republicans passed this sprawling tax and spending bill. And it sets a very different tone for America, phasing out support of clean energy and emphasizing defense and border spending over water, power, and transit infrastructure. And after passage of the bill, some house Republicans said they’re working with the administration to get, quote, “90% of all future projects terminated by making it harder to claim clean energy tax credits.” And sure enough, days later the White House issued an executive order on commenced construction rules that some are calling a backdoor cancellation of projects. While President Trump claims to be ushering in this golden era of energy infrastructure, we’re setting the conditions for constrained grid expansion, possible power shortages, higher electricity costs, and idle clean energy factories. And amidst this radical shift in policy, a coalition is emerging around a different set of pro-growth, pro-industrialization ideas, including one that’s well-known, abundance, popularized by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson in their new book.

But there are of course many others who are out there that have been articulating this vision for some time, and one of them is Brian Deese. Brian served as director of the National Economic Council from 2021 to 2023 where he coordinated economic policy with the clean energy economy as a critical pillar of that work. And he was a senior advisor to President Obama and the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock. And he’s an innovation fellow at MIT where he joins us from. And he published a stellar piece in Foreign Affairs back in March called Why America Struggles to Build. And he is here on Open Circuit to unpack that struggle. Brian, welcome.

Brian Deese: Thank you guys for having me.

America’s building capacity crisis

Stephen Lacey: I want to start with your premise in this piece that you wrote, which was fantastic. It got passed around in a lot of the circles that I am in. You make this argument that this moment when we’re on the cusp of massive economic changes from AI to bio manufacturing and of course climate change presents this unique imperative to build lots of new infrastructure. This is what we talk about regularly on this show. But make the case why our national capacity to build is so central to innovation and competitiveness in this new emerging economy.

Brian Deese: We are at a unique economic moment. And in my prior job at the National Economic Council, my goal is to think about the overall economy and look forward to not only where do we need to go over the next year or two, but over five or 10 years? And in a lot of exploration around that question, you came back again and again to the fact that for the first time in decades and in fact generations, our productive capacity as a country, our ability to increase GDP growth durably is rate limited today by our capacity to build. And that is a combination of a number of things coming together. It is, in the energy space, the return to demand and load growth, which we’ll get into, which is a generational trend, but puts us in a different paradigm than we were before. It’s in the technology and innovation space where the rise of AI and these other transformational technologies are intimately connected to our ability to build capacity to actually scale the innovation and then scale the utilization. And it’s connected to a very powerful structural change in our global geopolitics where we’ve shifted from broadly a geopolitical framework of markets and integration to one of fragmentation and resilience.

All of those things together put an imperative on our ability to build more physical capacity in order to unlock more economic growth. And that’s true if you look across almost every major sector of the economy. It’s true in the built environment of housing and physical buildings. It’s true for energy. And in a sense, from my perspective, that creates a very daunting prospect going forward. But I’m a perennial optimist. I also think as we think about big economic challenges we’ve faced as a country, I like this one more than others because this one actually operates on the supply side of our economy. If we can get it right and we can remove some of these barriers, we can unlock enormous investment and move very quickly on this front. The real issue is how do we do that?

Stephen Lacey: And what parallels can we draw from other eras of growth like say in the 1990s at the dawn of the digital economy?

Brian Deese: I think that if you look back, one of the great lessons is what we need is more physical capacity, looking at building the rails and building the systems that unlock that capacity becomes really important. In the digital economy, it was the build out of telecommunications and broadband infrastructure that has facilitated a lot of private investment and growth. Today it is, in energy, a lot of this is about the grid and a lot this is about transmission and not only where we are producing electricity, where we are producing energy, but where we are consuming it and how we’re moving it from place to place. But it’s also about the physical systems that enable growth in a smarter way, how people move around and where people live, which is why transportation, public transit, municipal infrastructure becomes really important as well. I think if you can get those systems investments right, you can unlock a lot more investment.

Jigar Shah: The challenge I see though is that we are entering a phase where people are not interested in their own economic wellbeing. You saw that from, for instance, Josh Hawley’s announcement around trying to get rid of the transmission line going through Missouri. The total amount of wealth creation that comes from that and that project is 13 or 14 years in. I guess what I’m trying to figure out is we depended upon logic and rationality in this conversation, and I feel like that is not where we are right now.

Brian Deese: I’m not going to try to defend that we’re at a moment of logic and rationality, that’s for sure. I think I may be a bit more optimistic that people actually are relatively rational and willing to support their self-interest as connected to the broader whole. I think maybe a different angle at that target, Jigar, is that if we think about building physical capacity, it’s one of the hardest things to connect the right economic outcome to the right practical, simple way of explaining why should I care about this and why is this good?

I’m quite buoyed by the change in the national conversation toward focusing on many of these problems. And at the same time, I worry a lot about us falling into narrative traps where we are talking about things that typical people who are living their lives would stop and say, “What on earth are you talking about? And why in the world should I care about that?” Well, it happens all the time in our space around… If you think about the grid and transmission space, there are a few things that are more important to actually unlocking cheaper, more reliable energy that helps people pay their grocery bill at the end of the month and then helps people get the jobs that they want and the economic security that they need. But if you think about 80% of the conversation we have around that, it is like a festival of acronym soup of DERs and GETs and RTOs and TOs and interconnected systems. And we have to wade into that complexity because that’s the way you actually drive system change, but we also need to operate in a very simple way.

And, Jigar, I think part of… We haven’t built the muscle memory to win big fights around saying, “Why does it matter whether or not we win the fight in the transmission line?” Ultimately it matters because you’re going to either have to pay higher electricity prices and you’re going to have less money for groceries or not. And somebody is making a choice on one side of those and somebody’s making a choice on the other side.

Look, I think it goes beyond energy too. Even the term abundance, if we just pause on it, abundance as a word is a word that you would hear much more often in law schools than you would hear in a bar. And I think that this is part of what we should all be thinking about when we’re thinking about the right questions for how we get to the right outcome is also how do we get from here to there and bring people to the table and actually ask them and listen to them and say, “Are we right that this matters to your life?” If it turns out that people say, “Yeah, you know what? I actually would rather pay higher electricity prices,” that would be a different conversation. I don’t think that we are getting to that conversation yet.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and it feels like we have to attack this from a bunch of different ways, but one is the project costs. Input material costs are high, there are labor shortages where we need them. And there is not an incentive to be really cost-effective when we build. One of my directors, Tyler, had worked especially with offshore wind, and these companies were trying to build projects not only to be cost-effective, which is very difficult to do, but also to comply with all the regulation that’s there. And these folks did not necessarily understand the NEPA process, NEPA being all the environmental regs. And a lot of these folks would find themselves on the wrong side of the law before they even knew what to do.

And what that leads us to the conclusion, I would think, is that we need more not just streamlining of processes and making more cost-effective of processes, but also capacity to help people through those processes. And that’s where I get hung up is that it seems like right now our system is trying to cut back on that human capacity that is needed in an effort to be cost-effective, and it ends up making everything just stop in its tracks.

Brian Deese: Yeah, look, I think one of the other reasons why I think progress here is hard is there’s multiple stacked reasons why it’s gotten hard and expensive to build in the US. And none of them on their own is easy to disentangle. And it’s really easy to make broad-brush statements around why it is that we got those multiple stacked problems, which is why I tend to like to approach these things by saying there’s so much that is messed up and there’s more than enough blame. And if you unpack this, there are certainly things that progressives at the local level or Democrats at the national level have gotten wrong. There are certainly things that Republicans are getting wrong too.

And so more important is actually saying what does good look like? Where’s the outcome that we want to get to? Katherine, to your point, how do we get to a place where we’re being sufficiently radical about streamlining or eliminating process or doing zero-based budgeting on process and saying, “Why is there any process at all?” And let’s justify any process. But where process is necessary to get to the outcome, not playing the cynical game of the star of the beast of saying, “Well, now things are failing because we’ve streamlined process, but we’ve also gotten rid of all of the humans, or we’ve gotten rid of all of the capability in the system, and so nothing is getting done even though we’ve done notional streamlining.”

Jigar Shah: Right, but that approach is exactly opposite of what we’ve done. What we’ve done in the past is fast track projects that matter, or whether it’s this or that. And I think what you’re suggesting, which I agree with, is that we are hurting every project, even projects that you never see because of the regulations that they perceive that they have to meet or standards that they have to meet. They have to hire some consultant for $85,000 to give them the analysis to show that they actually qualify for an exemption. And there’s time.

And so part of I think what you’re saying with the zero-based budgeting analogy is that we actually have to eliminate everything and then figure out which steps are actually needed and which steps might actually be costless because AI can do it or something else. And that mindset to me is unfathomable right now within Blue States. When you think about what it would take to do that kind of work just in blue states, I think the folks in California spent 10 years to get the CEQA rolled back. I can’t even imagine how we could get Westmore to do anything in Maryland to roll back a lot of these things. We’re in a weird spot right now.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, and to that point, is this more of a progressive blue state problem, Brian? On the left, you have obsession with process and a deference to government, and then on the right you have a lot of potential or actual destruction of economic value for the sake of politics. Where do you land in terms of where the challenges lie along the political spectrum?

Brian Deese: I think that fixing the endemic problems of over-process in progressive and blue states is absolutely necessary and also insufficient to really solve the problem, which is to say, yes, if we look at the trajectory of process-oriented stacked requirements, particularly in blue states, whether it’s housing or energy development, we got big problems, and we need to unpack and enroll a lot of those things. And at the same time, if we look at the federal level and we say, “How do we get to a pro-building, pro-economic growth, pro-lower costs and pro-climate outcome?” We’ve got big challenges to go through that loom larger on the Republican side of the balance sheet, so we need to be making progress in red states as well.

I guess I’m going to play optimist in this, which it’s a funny thing to find having spent a couple nights in airports and after the bill that passed last week, but I’m going to do it, which is, Jigar, when you were talking, it reminded me of the paraphrase, I think it’s the Bill Gates quote of, “Everything goes slower than you think in two years and everything goes faster than you think in 10 years,” which is I think we’re actually seeing some of the most… In terms of rate of change, of thinking, commitment, potential willingness to act, we’re seeing the second derivative, the rate of change now in a number of blue states is really exciting.

Now, we have a long way to go, but I think it’s possible that we look back 10 years from now and we say, “Yeah, there was an interesting moment. There was a fulcrum moment.” And I think part of that would’ve been all of the technological innovation that has led to this point that actually facilitates this to becoming really a deployment challenge. I would say some of the policymaking that we and others did in the last couple of years that helped reposition things. Some of this is the economic pincer associated with the return to energy demand, rising prices, and people feeling that more palpably. But I think it’s totally possible that we look back 10 years from now and say, “Wow, in that 10 year period, we made more progress than we had in the prior 50 years.”

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, it’s like you first have to identify what is the problem you’re trying to solve for? And then what are the solutions to get you there? This administration has identified we’re in an energy crisis, we need abundance, we need dominance, and yet the solutions they’ve come up with are not going to get us there. And we can dive into what those are, but putting tariffs on, giving tax cuts to corporations but not to the folks who are going to actually build out the infrastructure. But the idea of the problem does have solutions. And so Brian, I do think that the optimist would say, “All right, well, right now they’re coming up with the wrong solutions to the problem, but maybe states will be able to do it or maybe regions will be able to do it and come up with the solutions in a different way.” And that’s where I see a lot of hope.

Brian Deese: Well, and also, to a point that Jigar made earlier, technology, if we enable, can drive a ton of efficiency and cost through the building process itself, that for 25 years it’s been settled expectation that you have to pay. I think I would go up from your $85,000, Jigar, I would pay $250,000 in three months for a site study or that the process of drafting the documents to go into an application for an EIS costs this much and take this much time. Those types of activities are precisely the segments in the economy in other sectors where AI-driven technology is coming in and taking radical cost out, just radical cost. If you’re operating a consultancy today where your business is to take three months and charge $250,000 for a study that Jigar probably in the time that I’m answering this question could have queried a half decent LLM-

Stephen Lacey: Jigar doesn’t use LLMs.

Brian Deese: Well, whatever Jigar uses. Jigar GPT.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah.

Brian Deese: What I like about the zero based budgeting concept is it says defend anywhere where you need process. And the answer is not going to be zero, but defend everywhere where you need to and then enable, allow for the most efficient tools to deliver on that process. And if the answer is you can actually do something that previously took a year in a month, we should allow that to happen because the concern is that you go from a year to a month and what you’re doing is you’re just shortcutting really, really important work. And obviously where you can justify that, then you should do it. But the technology piece of this is also this is why these things coming together at this particular moment, means you could drive a lot of cost itself out of the building process just in terms of time and money along those stages.

Katherine Hamilton: I’m really hopeful that this partnership between PJM and Tapestry will actually shorten interconnection times. And that would be exactly the type of thing you’re seeing is this ability to shorten what you would normally take years to do.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, the thing I’m most worried about is that I feel like the way in which we’ve kept a coalition happy is by giving them interim milestones to hang their hat on. We’ve spent this much money; you should be grateful that we’ve spent this much money on this issue. And I think where we need to move to, and I think your article goes there, is to be more outcomes-based. We actually have to meet this moment. We have to meet the amount of infrastructure needed to unlock AI or unlock EV infrastructure or whatever it is.

And I think that one of the challenges that I see is that in this moment, there’s a lot of people whose benchmarks for success will have to be radically changed with their donors, and that process is emotional. I don’t know that it’s actually a tactical one, it’s an emotional one. And I’m hopeful that we all can be helpful to our friends in this space who I think one-on-one are quite generous with what you’re talking about in terms of the need for this radical rethink but I think institutionally are just lost. There are tens of thousands of people who work in that sector who are just like, “I have been fighting coal for 20 years, and I don’t know how to pivot to this moment and be helpful.”

Stephen Lacey: And just to be clear, Jig, are you talking about environmental groups, energy associations?

Jigar Shah: Justice groups, labor groups. There’s a lot of people who… For instance, when you look at the bill that was just passed, the National Association of Building Trades out hard and said that they were supportive of making sure this bill got improved. They were completely on our side. When you talk to the million people who work for the National Building Trades, they weren’t sure because they sort of liked the framing of these are fragile technologies, and we want to build strong technologies. And I think that bringing all of those people along with us is exactly what didn’t happen in the 2024 election. And so one of the challenges that we have moving forward is I like this vision, but getting people enthusiastic about pursuing it I think is what’s going to be the difference when we look back 10 years from now and realize that we’ve made all these changes.

Brian Deese: Well, and I also think it goes to you do need concrete and exciting outcomes that people can rally around. And one of the core issues and challenges associated with taking on building capacity as the exciting economic outcome for the future is that by definition, it takes time. And by definition, you need to maintain sufficient continuity. And endless people will come and say, “Well, pass the IRA and then we had the electoral outcomes. Isn’t that a failure?” And we all have to figure out a politics and a narrative politics that say we can change what the right milestones are, we can change what the right exciting things that people push for and rally for, but we also need to not lose sight of the fact that if we’re going to build five million new housing units in the US and we’re going to build more energy in the United States than we have ever as a civilization, then we have to be committed to those big things as national projects that are exciting and get people emotionally invested in those outcomes and understanding that those outcomes, if we succeed, will deliver over the course of years, not days, years, not months. And that is tricky. Jigar, you’re absolutely right.

But look, I think as you were talking, Jigar, I was thinking about outside of the energy space, an example of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the low-income Housing Tax Credit has an entire constituency around it. It’s the principle way in which we subsidize the build out of affordable multifamily housing in the US. And if we have really constrained supply, meaning it’s really, really hard to build, providing more Low-Income Housing Tax Credit doesn’t actually achieve the outcome that you want. You don’t end up with more housing. What you end up with is a higher share of the subsidy going to developers who are developing the same stock of multifamily housing. But even saying that, even stating that, and I just stated it in wonky terms, makes people uncomfortable because it’s like, well, wait a minute. If our goal was to advocate for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, then what are we supposed to do if we’re not advocating for that?

Jigar Shah: Well, the way I’ve said it for 10 years is that low-income housing costs more per square foot than luxury housing does in this country to construct. That is your zero-base budgeting. Why does it cost more to build low-income housing than luxury housing? I think that we are in a unique moment of everything being upside down.

And I agree with you, having a project that works is interesting. This bill that recently passed, I do think it provides clear support for distributed generation and microgrids. It is clear to me that every distributed generation of microgrid project is going to move forward now. And I think that’s exciting to everybody, right, left, middle. Some people hate their utility, that’s why they want a microgrid, some people love clean energy in their neighborhood and that’s why they want to do it.

There are goals where we can say we want 10 million rooftops by 2030 to get done, and that is going to require permitting reform at the local level. It’s going to require all this abundance framing to get done at the local level. It’s going to require folks who are reticent to adopt technology, to adopt AI tools. There’s all things that need to happen. I agree with you that there’s a tangible nature to this that we can put in place, but I do think that there’s a lot of people who define their power by the ability to force people to negotiate with their constituency through unnecessary process. And them giving up that power is going to be a very brutal conversation.

The outcome of the GOP’s reconciliation bill

Stephen Lacey: Since you brought it in, let’s talk about the Reconciliation Bill. We’ve established the challenge with coalition building. Let’s just talk about where we are politically and from an energy policy perspective.

And Katherine, to riff on what you said before, I think it was David Brooks maybe who said that Trump is the wrong answer to the right questions. It’s one of my favorite quotes about Trump. And Brian, you reflect on this in your piece. You talk about the administration’s dominance approach. And you write, “The economic policy approach that the administration seems intent on pursuing will make it harder to unleash a building boom with tariffs driving up costs for construction and manufacturing materials, political and economic uncertainty, limiting investment, and massive tax cuts, further ballooning the deficit and raising borrowing costs.”

And then meanwhile, we’ve seen the Department of Government Efficiency cut critical teams that can accelerate infrastructure projects, regulatory decisions that may require White House approval, potentially slowing down some decisions. Let’s talk about all of that, but I want to talk about the BBB, the Big Beautiful Bill. Katherine, lay it on us. Where did we end up on the energy front?

Katherine Hamilton: Well, I guess the best thing you could say is it could’ve been worse, although that’s not seeing that much. The clean energy credits, especially for solar and wind, solar and winds were targeted more than anything else. Projects do have four years from commence construction. If you start your construction within 12 months of enactment, then you have another four years or so to build. Otherwise, you have to have placed in service by December of 2027.

The issue with this… And so that seems like it gives everything a runway, but there was also some other regulatory pieces put into place, the foreign entities of concern, which will be a compliance issue as will the definition of commence construction. In order to get this bill over the finish line and get the folks from the Freedom Caucus to sign on, they said, “Yeah, sure, we’ll sign on, but we want you to do more damage to wind and solar than is already in the bill.” And so there was an executive order put out. The administration has 45 days to put into place definitions for commence construction and for also these foreign entities of concern compliance. And we just don’t know where that’s going to land.

Now, I would say some of the other provisions, the 45X manufacturing, storage, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, those were not in as bad shape, but these FIOC, as they’re called, guidance could really throw a wrench in the works. And what’s weird is of course this is like regulation. This is actually doing exactly the opposite of what the president touts, which is we’re going to just let everybody build wherever they want. Well, that’s not actually true. They will let coal build where they want, they will let oil and gas build where they want, but they will not let renewables build where they want. That is part of the issue.

The other thing is that there were some tools that were… All the home energy credits were taken down, the 30D, which was the EV credit is going to stop, the 25D solar rooftop ends at the end of this year. But then also, a big tool that I thought was going to be really important to leverage and leverage in a smart economic way was the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, this National Green Bank. And Brian, you’ve talked about this with an infrastructure bank, which is let’s figure out how to leverage the private sector, try to drive in and crowd in finance and provide a lot of tools. Now, a lot of that money had already gone out the door, so it’s being put to work now, but a lot of this was simply about we want to roll back whatever President Biden did. And it was done in a very clunky half hazard way that in the end is not going to get the president, as we have talked about, the goal that he has set forward of energy abundance.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. I want to hopefully take a little bit of time to unpack the foreign entity of concern stuff and the commenced construction stuff. Just firstly, Brian, big picture reactions to the bill. What is this telling us about America’s priorities?

Brian Deese: Well, it suggests that the current administration has a incredible political holdover its majority. As a pure act of politics, it was impressive in terms of holding ranks on the bill. On substance, it’s Concerning on three fronts. The first, and you referenced it, Steve and I referenced it before, is that this is the most fiscally reckless piece of legislation that has been passed in my lifetime. And it comes at a moment where we don’t have available fiscal space to be operating anywhere near this recklessly. We’ve now locked in as a country go forward deficits of somewhere between 7% and 8% of GDP. We’ve run a deficit above 6% of GDP four times since World War II. All of those were periods of economic crisis. We’re now locked in on a independent [inaudible 00:35:30] cycle the deficits of that magnitude. And we’ve reduced our revenue structurally by 2% or 3% of GDP in a way that will have generational impacts for the country, for the cost of borrowing, for our economic strength, for our resilience to stand up against foreign adversaries. And so that’s at the top line concerning.

The second piece is it’s a deeply troubling and inhumane bill in terms of what it does in terms of taking healthcare away from over 10 million Americans and raising the cost of healthcare and undermining a lot of the progress that we have made over the last decade in actually providing healthcare to more Americans in a more efficient and more cost-efficient way. People don’t recognize, in addition to being a critical support for the elderly, people with disabilities, Medicaid is also a highly efficient program. Per capita, healthcare spending and Medicaid is significantly below private healthcare spending in the US. And so that will undermine our capacity as a country as well.

And then the third obviously is on the energy side. And I think we are making things more difficult for ourselves. And things are going to get more expensive and more costly. And so this is all a challenge.

Now, my baseline, and again I’ll play to the optimist, is in the period since this has passed, I feel like people have been going into two camps, which is the defensive crouch, despair camp of, “Oh God, what do we do?” And the other is the Timothy Snyder preemptive obedience stuff of, “Ph no, it’s fine. It’ll all be fine. Everything will be fine.” And I think the truth is that the economic forces behind driving cheaper, more reliable, cleaner energy are on our side and are very, very powerful, but we now need to be much more creative about figuring out how to unlock and how to harness them and how to get a lot more out of the existing energy system we have.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar, what camp are you in?

Jigar Shah: My God, have you failed miserably on political power camp. For the love of God, when you are deploying twice as much CapEx per year as the oil and gas sector, which in and of itself is the largest oil and gas sector in the entire world with 14 million barrels a day of drilling, and you spend 1/20th of the budget on influence as the oil and gas sector did, you brought this on yourself. And I’m just saying that I think that this time period where, “Everyone is going to see things our way because logic and reasonableness are on our side, are over.

We have over 20% of all the counties in the United States now that have banned solar and wind deployment on their land. And for a long time, the solar and wind industry were like, “We don’t care because we can work on the other 80% of counties.” Well, it’s time to care. It’s time to actually care.

We have overly financialized our assets. You work in communities; every one of those communities needs sponsorship of their T-ball team. Every one of those communities, you need to know who the city council and mayors and county commissioners are. And you need to maintain a relationship with them for 20 years, not just until you get your permit so you can start construction.

I just think that we are in a place right now where right now, we do not have the political power necessary to thrive and to meet the economic needs of our country. And so people need to understand what that means. That doesn’t mean Democrats, by the way, it just means that for all of these places, they were so afraid of Donald Trump that they were willing to destroy the economics of their district and vote for Trump’s bill. That is a wake-up call if I’ve ever seen one.

Katherine Hamilton: Here’s the thing. There are two things you need to do, or maybe three, because, Jigar, you did talk about influence at the community level, which I think is crucial. But I also think they need to be held accountable. There has to be pain felt about taking these votes when they wrote letters after letters clutching their pearls and saying, “Oh, we’ll never vote for a bill that does any harm to our constituents,” whether it was for Medicaid cuts or whether it was for clean energy cuts, and they all got in line and voted.

Stephen Lacey: Well, that brings us to a really interesting question, which is also the opportunity here. This is a very unpopular bill. The polling is quite bad. I guess, Brian, I’m curious about what you think the potential political consequences could be by talking about the lost economic opportunity, but also does it create an opportunity to present a more optimistic pro-growth agenda?

Brian Deese: I think it creates a huge imperative. It’s not even just an opportunity, but an absolute imperative to… If we can’t demonstrate the negative consequences of this piece of legislation on the lives and livelihoods of tens, if not hundreds of millions of Americans in a way that they respond and react, then, A, shame on us, and B, we have got much bigger problems.

I think that the most well-worn and the place where I think we will see that the clearest and painfully because people will experience palpable pain is because of the pullback of healthcare benefits and healthcare support. We are this fall going to see millions and millions of Americans who will receive letters that, “You now have to pay a lot more for your health insurance,” and then next year people receiving indications saying, “You’re going to lose your healthcare coverage altogether.” And if we could have avoided that, that would’ve been priority one, but now the reality is that people need to understand that that’s the case.

But I would say, to go back to the point that Jigar was making, I think that we don’t have yet a political and a narrative architecture to just turn on and make the case on the energy side about all of the ways in which this bill is going to undermine and undercut our security costs and the like. And so I think now is a moment not only for going out and making that case, but actually really pushing ourselves to innovate and try different angles at the target. Because we’re not to a place where we can just turn that on and say, “Well, people understand the pain, and we just need to make sure that they connect it to this bill,” I think we’ve got more work to do.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and I don’t think we made the case for the Inflation Reduction Act. We didn’t really have enough time because it takes a while to build. And part of any kind of successful build out is having political stability over long-term so that you can actually get things done. And I think it took a little while, for example, for Obama’s Obamacare to actually start yielding benefits where people were saying, “No, don’t take it away from me.” And I think the same is true for clean energy. We did not make the case enough that people were on the ground saying, “No, no, no, no, don’t take that away from us.” I think we’ll see the results of that once they start losing their jobs and costs start going up. But not only we didn’t have enough time, and I just don’t think we made the case the way we needed to.

How do you build a pro-building coalition?

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, that brings me to a question that I wanted to grapple with Brian, which is what can we learn from the failure of messaging around the IRA? You and Jigar, as part of the administration, were out there with clear, cohesive arguments. I heard you on Ezra Klein’s podcast explaining Biden’s economic policy. Jigar is out there talking about creating climate wealth and the projects that are getting financed. And so there was good communication happening, but unfortunately you had a president that was unwilling to echo that well. And I’m just curious, the economic arguments were there percolating around, they didn’t break through as much. What did we learn about how they didn’t break through? And how can we apply that to this moment?

Brian Deese: One, you have to be committed to time discipline and overwhelming force. There’s no major economic policy that has been enacted in the US in the last 25 years that was popular immediately out of the gate. If you look at the Affordable Care Act, it wasn’t until three, five, seven years down the line when people felt palpably that their benefits might be taken away that people understood the benefit to their lives. And that’s true not just for democratic initiatives, it’s true for Republican initiatives as well. Look at the major tax cut. The one is it may seem like an easy answer to say, “Well, there wasn’t enough time.” I would flip it on its head to say our movement needs to have militant commitment to discipline and not constantly questioning or pulling back, but staying with your foot on the accelerator is number one.

Number two, I think we need to win this on economic terms and we also need to win this on visceral terms. On the economic side, we need to win that this is about jobs, it’s about wealth, and it’s about the cost that you pay at your kitchen table. But we also need to win this in a visceral sense. Part of what we see in the narrative and cultural debates around electric vehicles, part of what we see around the narrative and cultural debates around wind and solar is there’s this underlying sense of there is weak and unreliable energy and then there’s strong and reliable energy. And we all know substantively, we all get the substance and the economics of that. We could argue until the cows are blue. Is that the saying, cows are blue?

Katherine Hamilton: Until the cows come home.

Brian Deese: We could argue until the blue cows come home about why it is in fact that most of the reliability and strength and security comes from distributed sources of energy and all of that. But we need to win at a more visceral level that the things that will make us the strongest and the most secure and are the most reliable in our lives are the things that get us away from big price swings, foreign actors controlling our domestic destiny. We’ve got to win at a visceral level too because that’s behind a lot of this. That’s a lot of what’s behind the narrative debates on electric vehicles, as an example.

Stephen Lacey: You hit on something really important there, which is this cultural element and a lot of people seeing renewables as weak, which is why I think we’re having this conversation to talk about it in terms of hard infrastructure. I like that you brought up that point.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, but I want to make sure that we don’t lose the forest for the trees here. If this bill had passed without the IRA being passed first, it would’ve been the single largest subsidy for climate technologies in the history of the US Congress. And so when you think about just how much ground we maintained, it was extraordinary.

And my sense is that after the midterm elections is over, to the extent there are any manufacturers in people’s districts that need extensions of 45X that congress will willfully grant it. And my sense is that this conversation that we’re having is really about the lack of political power by the solar and wind industry. When you think about batteries and how little power batteries had for so long, they first got their tax credit in the IRA, that the IRA, those battery tax credits were fully maintained and juiced all the way to 2033. And when you think about all of the add-ons that we had for the tax credit, whether it was the labor add-on or whether it was energy communities add-on or some of those, those were all maintained. How did that happen? How in God’s grace did they figure out how to put in all of these adders and leave them in place? They would’ve taken them out first.

I feel like, for whatever reason, because we’re just colored within solar and wind, we have not really recognized the fact that the vast majority of the IRA was actually maintained in this bill. When people say, “Oh, there’s no political durability within the IRA,” I get the rhetoric, but for people on the ground who actually put their blood, sweat, and tears into building a new manufacturing facility in Dalton, Georgia or figured out how to get something together in Terre Haute, Indiana or et cetera, those people got a reprieve out of this bill. They’re going to be able to continue their manufacturing. And I think they believe they’re going to fight to be able to extend it after the midterms.

Brian Deese: I just want to double down on that point. And it goes to the political durability of policy change, which is the way that we make progress on maintaining and then expanding the policies that we think are going to change the country for the better is by actually learning from what we have done effectively politically, and then doing more of it and not going into the defensive crouch and/or clutching our pearls and saying, “How did all of this go wrong?” And instead say, “How do we keep winning? Let’s look where we won, how we won, and do we keep winning on that front?”

And I know I’m keep making healthcare analogies, but the analogy to healthcare is apt in this context, which is learn where you can win politically, do more of that. Worry less about how to do the stuff that’s not working and do more of what is working. And Jigar, I think part of the reason why… Look, part of the reason why batteries, which could have gone into the category of wind and solar or could have gone into their strong in firm, part of that is because of a narrative architecture around batteries being key to our economic security because having more independence and control over the upstream battery supply chain is connected to a security imperative. I think there’s something to learn from that. And we can lean into that and we can think more about where that takes us in other technologies as well.

Stephen Lacey: Those are both really good points, but I think the wild card here is the foreign entity of concern piece and the White House executive order on commence construction. Katherine, can you unpack those a little bit more for us? The foreign entity of concern thing is a policy tool used by the Biden administration. Why is this different? And why is the commence construction piece such a challenge?

Katherine Hamilton: Right. Well, it just totally depends on how the regs are written. And they have 45 days to do so. On one hand, you could say, “Oh, that’s actually great because that will provide certainty to the industry, so we’ll know exactly which direction to go in.” But the other side of that is are they going to write it such that it is impossible to do business? So that the regs, while not outside of the statute, still make it very, very difficult and where investors and banks are saying, “I don’t know, this seems like really difficult thing to do.”

I honestly agree with Jigar on a lot of this. The Inflation Reduction Act and also the infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act all put us in a certain trajectory, and I honestly don’t think that trajectory is stopping, but what I think that this bill has done for pieces of that is make it a lot harder. And I don’t think it means we’re not going to go. I hear from my clients every day, “All right, we are resilient. We’re going to figure out how to make this work.” There are a lot of analyses that indicate huge job loss, huge economic devastation from having these roll back.

At the same time, our industry is really strong, and I think that we will figure out a way to do it. I just hate the fact that we’re getting kneecapped or slowed down in that it’s going to make it so much harder. And I think, Stephen, that’s where we’re getting to is the fact that this administration, while rolling back a lot of other regulation, is putting new regulations in place for solar and wind is just going to make it harder. And it’s going to actually make it harder for the other technologies as well because of the FIAC restriction.

We’ll see how that turns out. It all hinges on how Treasury and IRS define everything. And I think that means people need to be very, very engaged. They need to be engaged with those agencies. They need to look at their supply chains, figure out where everything is going. They need to figure out what their pipeline is and get it ready. Everybody needs to be working as hard as they can, nevermind the fact that we don’t have the political strength. We need to do a lot of work still.

Stephen Lacey: Brian, I know we need to get you back to your kids after a long couple of nights at the airport, so I just want to finish up here with a question about what you think the most practical solutions are right now that could move the needle on America’s building capacity in energy or otherwise. Are there things just staring us in the face that you know that we should implement?

Brian Deese: 80% of the challenge that projects face are connected with state, municipal, and local regulations and processes that if you apply the right approach and the right discipline and you take a zero-based budgeting approach, we could make dramatic progress. And we’re seeing across the country that happen. This is a great example of Laboratory of Democracy stuff where we’re seeing that happen. We syndicate that and we syndicate that across the country. That is probably the most promising and powerful way to drive progress in the short term.

And the second is connected to what we were just talking about around where we continue to have long-term, durable incentives to bill. If we look at the existing energy system, the opportunity to optimize and get more out of the existing energy system, particularly into a period where prices will go up, volatility will go up, is an enormous economic opportunity. And so for new businesses and business models who want to take advantage of that opportunity, particularly into state and local and regional areas where they actually are willing to forego process in service of building, those two things together are where we’re going to really see, I think, a lot of exciting developments in the relatively short term.

Stephen Lacey: Brian Deese is an innovation fellow at MIT. He’s the former director of the National Economic Council. Brian, thank you so much.

Brian Deese: Thank you guys. It was fun.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar, Katherine, we’ll catch you guys next week. Thank you.

Katherine Hamilton: It was great. Thanks.

In the 2022 IRP, Georgia Power committed to proposing and supporting energy efficiency programs that would produce energy savings equal to 0.75% of its annual retail sales.
As the time approached to deliver on the promise, Georgia Power met repeatedly with stakeholders to help develop the 0.75% energy savings plan.
Then, Georgia Power submitted the 0.75% energy savings plan with a massive, unrealistic price tag (including six times the customer rebates to achieve only 50% more energy savings).
Georgia Power issues periodic RFPs for new power projects under an “All-Source Procurement” process, which determines what types of resources actually get developed.","Last week, Georgia Power Company and the Staff of the Public Service Commission reached a settlement agreement (called a “stipulation” or “stip”) regarding the Company’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The IRP is a roadmap to meet the future energy needs of Georgia Power’s customers. The decisions outlined in the IRP will strongly influence electric system reliability, electricity rates paid by consumers, and the amount of harmful air pollution that power plants will emit for decades to come. The IRP also contains programs to help customers reduce energy needs so that the overall energy system will cost less.

In this case, the Commission’s Staff is recommending that the Commission approve a stip settling these numerous issues. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, July 15, where commissioners will have the opportunity to amend the stipulation before a final vote. They could also reject the stipulation, although this is very rare.

SACE has not signed onto this agreement, though several other intervening organizations have. While we tend to agree with many items in the stipulation agreement, there are key pieces that we think need improvement, and one key piece that we simply cannot support. Therefore, we’re breaking down key pieces of the agreement that are good, some that are bad, and several that introduce a high level of uncertainty in the plan.

The Good

Some of the transmission-related items in the agreement represent positive steps forward, such as greater consideration of grid-enhancing technologies (or GETs) that help us get more out of our current grid. Additionally, as SACE requested, the stip requires that Georgia Power continue to file reports on the addition of large new electric customers such as massive computer data centers that are expected to drive expansion of the electric system over the next decade. The public has a strong interest in understanding whether and to what degree these large customers are adding new costs and challenges and bringing new revenue to the electric system.

The stip also would grant large customers, such as data centers, more freedom in meeting their own needs through new clean energy resources. Georgia Power, for instance, has agreed that these large energy users, who are represented in this case by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), can pay extra to increase the amount of solar energy developed through its competitive procurement process. As of the weekend before the decision, however, Georgia Power had not agreed to fully credit the generating capacity of large-scale batteries that CEBA members want to develop. Given the urgency of adding non-polluting generating capacity to the grid and the willingness of large customers to pay for it, SACE strongly favors amending the stip to fully credit these customer-financed batteries.

Several customer pilot programs proposed in the IRP were also included in the agreement. These programs are another step in the right direction since they create new pathways for customers to add to grid stability through customer-sited solar plus storage, or through vehicles to grid for electric school buses. However, as is the case with all customer programs, implementation will be key for ensuring that both the customer and the utility system benefit from the program. For example, one program is aimed at bringing solar and battery storage online for smaller customers, such as homes and small businesses. But the current proposal limits customer energy systems to a size that may be insufficient to drive heating and air conditioning. This provision should be modified to ensure that customers can have enough solar and battery capacity to fully power a home during a power outage.

Another positive provision is the “vehicle-to-everything” pilot program. This pilot program will test the ability of electric school buses to put power on the grid during high-load events. SACE has previously written about how medium and heavy-duty vehicles, such as electric school buses, can act as a grid resource through managed charging and vehicle-to-grid. The success of this pilot will be influenced by decisions like the selection of software and hardware vendors or the level of ongoing support provided to school districts during implementation. Since this type of program generally allows the utility to take direct control of the charging of the vehicle, it will be important for Georgia Power to provide ongoing support during implementation in order to build confidence with school bus operators that participation in the program will not conflict with providing transportation.

The stipulation also continues Georgia Power’s steady buildout of utility-scale solar. More solar is always good news. However, given the huge expected energy needs, analysis by our independent expert showed that building even more solar would reduce system costs and would help reduce the impact of unpredictable fossil fuel price spikes.

The Bad

This stip delays the previously expected retirement of a coal plant (Scherer Unit 3) that will soon be 40 years old. It also fails to set retirement dates for other units at Scherer or the units at the Bowen coal plant. Our expert analysis clearly showed, as has previous Georgia Power analysis, that these coal plants are uneconomic, and it is better for ratepayers if they are retired earlier. SACE believes that the Commission should keep the Scherer Unit 3 retirement date and set deadlines that will speed the retirement of the other coal units.

The stip approves a significantly increased budget for programs that help customers save energy, which is a good thing, but it does not require an equivalent increase in energy savings. This issue is important not only because customer efficiency is the cheapest and cleanest way to meet energy demand, but also because Georgia Power is backtracking on a commitment from three years ago.

In the 2022 IRP, Georgia Power committed to proposing and supporting energy efficiency programs that would produce energy savings equal to 0.75% of its annual retail sales. This amount of energy savings would be about 50% more than what Georgia Power has produced recently, but is still significantly below what other utility companies have achieved for years. As the time approached to deliver on the promise, Georgia Power met repeatedly with stakeholders to help develop the 0.75% energy savings plan. Numerous organizations, including SACE, attended, gave suggestions, and analyzed data and ideas provided by Georgia Power. Then, Georgia Power submitted the 0.75% energy savings plan with a massive, unrealistic price tag (including six times the customer rebates to achieve only 50% more energy savings). In parallel, it also submitted a cheaper alternative plan that had never been shown to stakeholders and that largely maintained the status quo for energy savings. This tricky course of action was clearly intended to steer the Commission away from the 0.75% savings plan that Georgia Power had agreed to support.

Georgians deserve progress on energy efficiency without games or overblown costs. Hopefully, on Tuesday, the Commission will amend the stip to require Georgia Power to meet its promised 0.75% energy savings target.

The Unknown

Perhaps the most fundamental issue in the case is the size of Georgia Power’s projected load growth: several intervenor experts, plus the Commission’s own staff, have warned that Georgia Power is over-estimating load growth, which could result in overbuilding billions of dollars in power plants. The stip requires the Company to collaborate with staff in the coming months to update the load forecast that will be used to determine how much power to procure in a future RFP, including potentially the method of creating the load forecast. While this could lead to a load forecast that is based on better information, at the end of a litigated utility planning case, this fundamental determinant of the amount of power that will be procured has been left largely to non-public negotiation between the Company and the Commission’s staff.

This brings us to the procurement process: under the regulatory system in Georgia, the biggest decisions affecting the implementation of Georgia Power’s IRP will actually be made outside the IRP process. Georgia Power issues periodic RFPs for new power projects under an “All-Source Procurement” process, which determines what types of resources actually get developed. In this case, the agreement would allow Georgia Power to procure up to 8,500 MW of energy projects from RFP bids that have already been made, but for which the costs have remained secret throughout the IRP process. That is a huge amount of power, exceeding, for instance, the whole size of nearby utility companies such as Dominion Energy South Carolina and Santee Cooper.

All-Source Procurement – a concept SACE supports – is intended to ensure that all types of generation resources compete on an even playing field to drive down the cost of meeting future energy needs. Like any bidding process, a great deal of care must be taken to avoid gaming by bidders or having the terms of the RFP itself steer the outcome. Historically, in Georgia, “All Source” has mostly meant new natural gas power plants. In fact, Georgia Power’s own affiliate has indicated that it is currently analyzing electric transmission projects to interconnect a large amount of new gas plant capacity that presumably will fulfill the RFP.

A Challenging Moment

SACE recognizes that projected massive electricity demand growth creates a historic challenge for Georgia Power, its state regulators, and eventually its customers. Serving increased needs while retiring the most polluting power plants on the system would require decisive action in the face of great uncertainty, among elected commissioners who, themselves, do not always agree.

We believe that the actions that are most certain and least likely to lead to uncontrolled cost outcomes are (1) helping customers save energy and (2) rapidly expanding renewable energy and battery storage. We are concerned that, when secrecy is lifted on up to 8,500 MW of power projects, it will reflect a massive fossil gas power buildout that will tie much of the state’s economy to a volatile, polluting energy source for decades to come. We urge the Commission to take large tech companies up on their offer to do more to help foot the bill for renewable energy and storage, to maximize additions of renewable energy, and to hold Georgia Power to its word regarding a modest, 0.75% annual energy savings target. Those actions, plus careful oversight of upcoming procurement dockets, should curb some of the risks associated with a historic expansion of energy systems in Georgia.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-Featured-Imgs-Mastheads-Promos-with-image-abovetext-below-.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 19:11:47.352032

EGLE issued nine air quality advisory days in 2024, all because of ozone pollution and none from wildfire smoke.","Officials warn southeast Michigan residents to be careful outdoors Tuesday because of expected high ozone pollution levels.

The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments issued an air quality advisory for Tuesday because of the pollution forecast. It is the eighth air quality advisory the group has issued this year, although the rest have been for particulate matter pollution caused by Canadian wildfire smoke blowing into Michigan or a combination of particulate matter and ozone pollution.

SEMCOG issued only six air quality advisories last year for the seven-county southeast Michigan region. It issued 21 in 2023, a year when Michigan was inundated with smoke from northerly wildfires.

Ground-level ozone pollution is created when two air pollutants, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, react in the presence of sunlight. Those air pollutants come from sources like fossil fuel burning, refineries and cars.

Breathing ozone can cause health problems, particularly for elderly people, children and people with respiratory issues such as asthma.

The weather will be sunny and hot on Tuesday in southeast Michigan, Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy senior meteorologist Jim Haywood said. Temperatures could reach close to 90 degrees. That combined with low wind speeds and dew points in the mid-60s, are ""ideal for ozone development,"" he said.

""As a result, we are issuing an Ozone Advisory for the Southeast Michigan area for Tuesday,"" Haywood said in a press release Monday. ""Fortunately, this looks to be a one-day event as clouds and rain move in Wednesday afternoon in advance of an approaching cold front.""

In the release, the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments recommended people avoid strenuous outdoor activities, especially if they have asthma or another respiratory disease.

People also can limit activities that create ozone-forming pollution by avoiding refueling their cars, avoiding the use of gasoline-powered equipment and avoiding the use of charcoal lighter fluid.

Much of Michigan experienced high particulate matter pollution levels over the most recent weekend because wildfire smoke blew over the state.

That smoke plume is floating into Ontario, according to an EGLE air quality forecast issued Monday. EGLE meteorologists did not expect the state to have unsafe levels of particulate matter pollution on Tuesday or through the week, although they will monitor for plumes of smoke.

Particulate matter pollution, specifically the small particles known as PM 2.5, are dangerous because they are small enough to be breathed into the deepest part of a person's lungs and into their bloodstream. The pollutant comes from sources such as vehicle exhaust, fossil fuel burning, tobacco smoke and industrial factories. It can cause serious health problems.

Tuesday marks the 18th day a portion of Michigan has had an air quality advisory, EGLE air quality meteorologist Stephanie Hengesbach said in an email.

EGLE issued nine air quality advisory days in 2024, all because of ozone pollution and none from wildfire smoke. In 2023, the department issued pollution advisories on 31 days, all because of smoke.

Mihai Dorobantu, director of technology planning and government affairs for Eaton’s mobility group, said the company is looking to hybrid technology in the heavy truck segment instead of fully electric powertrains.
“The trade-offs [for electric vehicles] are much more extreme than in the passenger car world,” Dorobantu said.
“We often have fleets that are shocked to hear that we don’t think we can electrify their whole fleet,” Harris said.
However, hybrid technology is here to stay, said Eaton’s Dorobantu.","[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

Hybrid technologies that combine electric powertrains with internal combustion engines remain uncommon in the commercial vehicle segment, but some manufacturers are introducing forms of hybridization geared specifically toward freight transportation.

Jeff Seger, clean energy consultant for the North American Council for Freight Efficiency, is a supporter of hybrid technology for commercial fleets, but he said there must be a real economic benefit to fleet operators, not just an environmental benefit.

“This stuff won’t take off unless there’s real value to the customer, meaning the total cost of ownership or the payback period is attractive,” he said. “Either that or it must be regulation driven.”

There are many challenges associated with electric powertrains in heavy-duty trucks, Seger continued, noting vehicle range limitations, the added weight of the necessary batteries and the availability of raw ­materials.

“That’s where I think hybrids are nice, because with a hybrid you can get away — depending on how strong of a hybrid [it] is — with one-fifth of the battery material,” he said, adding that operators could trickle charge at night, depending on the hybrid model. “You don’t need opportunity charging where you have to zap 500 kilowatt hours of energy into it in a short period of time.”

Seger added that those benefits present hybrids as a good middle solution that offers sustainability and environmental improvement at a lower cost and with less range anxiety.

Range Energy is enabling diesel-­electric hybridization in the trucking industry not through the tractor, but by providing electric power to the trailer.

The company’s eTrailer system adds an electric-powered axle and a high-voltage battery to the trailer, which provides propulsion support for the tractor and can also power other systems, such as refrigeration and liftgates.

As a result, these electric-powered trailers can improve miles per gallon by about 67% while cutting greenhouse gas emissions by about 70%, according to Range Energy, which estimates the payback period for the technology as about five years.

Instead of pursuing a binary switch from diesel to electric, Range En­ergy set out to make the diesel tractor-­trailers that dominate the industry more efficient and cleaner, said Ali Javidan, the company’s founder and chief technology officer.

“What I wanted to do was develop a piece of technology that was specifically empathetic to this industry but also has to have a massive ability to move the needle,” he said.

Drawing on his background in the trucking industry and on his work in development at Tesla, Javidan began thinking about how much the trailer and the load it holds dictates operation efficiency and safety. That led to the spark that ignited his business plan.

“Why don’t we bring intelligence to the trailer?”

Range Energy found a niche where refrigerated carriers in particular can benefit from the cost savings and zero-emission refrigeration. Other companies are focusing on specific applications as well.

Mihai Dorobantu, director of technology planning and government affairs for Eaton’s mobility group, said the company is looking to hybrid technology in the heavy truck segment instead of fully electric powertrains.

“The trade-offs [for electric vehicles] are much more extreme than in the passenger car world,” Dorobantu said. “We’re looking at vehicles that consume, on a daily basis, one megawatt hour, one and a half megawatt hours of energy. Even with our best-case scenarios on batteries, that’s a lot of battery.”

Dorobantu noted that it equates to 10 or 15 times the size of the standard passenger car battery and extremely lengthy charge times.

“We’re seeing that there are parts of the heavy-duty sector that are either very hard to electrify or impossible to electrify,” he said.

Hybrids offer a compromise, Dorobantu said — lower costs and ­fewer drawbacks than purely battery-­powered EVs, but many of the ­benefits.

The company’s work on heavy trucks led to a hybrid system that combines internal combustion engines with a heavy electric component, currently being developed for the U.S. Army and Marines.

Eaton has been able to produce hybrid engines that produce emissions at the level of natural gas systems, but using diesel fuel, Dorobantu said.

“Very low emissions, but using a fuel that’s ubiquitous as diesel,” he said. “That’s almost nirvana.”

Dorobantu said the company is pursuing specialized uses for hybrid vehicles, particularly in applications like refuse vehicles, car haulers and other use cases that have a more intense drive cycle and where performance is important.

“A hybrid is more expensive than a pure internal combustion engine, certainly, much cheaper than a pure BEV,” he said. “But for the added expense, what benefits will people get?”

It’s important, Dorobantu said, to balance what the technology can save operators with how much it will cost to purchase.

NACFE’s Seger agreed, saying hybrid manufacturers must be able to price their vehicles so that payback periods work for the fleets. If it takes too long for the truck to reach profitability for the carriers, there’s no value in the purchase. The conversation changes, he said, if there’s a regulatory structure creating demand for the more expensive vehicles.

Harbinger Motors focuses its all-electric and plug-in hybrid trucks on specific market segments — Class 4-6 trucks with heavy start-and-stop demands.

Assemblers at the Harbinger Motors production plant in Garden Grove, Calif. (Harbinger Motors)

The company introduced an electric medium-duty model equipped with a gasoline-powered range extender at the 2025 Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in April. The vehicle offers a range of up to 500 miles on a single charge.

Harbinger is finding success by bringing down the total cost of ownership and focusing exclusively on fleets that stand to benefit the most from electric vehicle and hybrid technology, said John Harris, the company’s co-founder and CEO.

“People have this tendency to think that electrification is a one-size-fits-all solution, and they want to come and wedge it into every corner. Our approach has been very different than that,” Harris said.

The company believes that within medium-duty applications, electrification is a good solution for 60-80% of the market. As a result, it markets its vehicles to that specific portion of the market, not the entire industry.

“We often have fleets that are shocked to hear that we don’t think we can electrify their whole fleet,” Harris said. “It’s just not feasible.”

Economic and freight market conditions have a big impact on the willingness for fleets to purchase new hybrids, which makes the payback period and total cost of ownership conversation even more important. However, hybrid technology is here to stay, said Eaton’s Dorobantu.

“In the short term, the market in general faces a lot of uncertainty, which is probably not conducive to more investment,” he said. “I think in the longer term, we believe that this is the future.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-07/RangeEnergy-1200.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 19:11:25.981910
,Clean Energy ,2025-07-14 22:03:40+00:00,INDY Week,Budget Bill Hits NC's Renewable Energy Industry - INDY Week,Chase Pellegrini de Paur,,,,,https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/nc-renewable-energy-solar-budget-bill/,"Etheridge, who is from eastern North Carolina, called it an “American success story” in one of the most business-friendly states in the country.
Those provisions were set to continue through 2034, making renewable energy a pretty attractive industry for investors.
That residential solar tax credit “supports probably 50 percent of our total business and employment,” Etheridge tells INDY.
“We knew the writing was on the wall,” Etheridge told INDY after the event.
“It’s about, for me, the jobs and the skills and the people and how we help them grow,” Etheridge told INDY.","When Boviet Solar opened a new factory in Greenville this year, Will Etheridge, owner and CEO of Raleigh’s Southern Energy Management, was excited for his company to buy solar panels built in North Carolina and install them on North Carolina homes and businesses. Etheridge, who is from eastern North Carolina, called it an “American success story” in one of the most business-friendly states in the country.

Then President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” changed everything.

“We switched from planning for [expansion] to planning for job protection and layoffs,” Etheridge told a roundtable hosted by Representative Deborah Ross in Garner last week. “Now I’m going to be laying off North Carolinians.”

That’s because Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill guts the tax credit programs that Democrats muscled through in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act paid 30 percent of renewable energy-related homeowner expenditures (including installation of solar panels, solar water heaters, and related battery storage technology), provided a tax credit for builders of energy efficient homes, and provided tax incentives for investments in clean energy.

Those provisions were set to continue through 2034, making renewable energy a pretty attractive industry for investors. And the vast majority of those investments were in red districts.

It’s easy to tune out some sweeping numbers (the Clean Investment Monitor estimates that 18,100 North Carolinians work in operational and construction jobs created as a result of energy and manufacturing investments, with 20,000 potential jobs based on planned investments), but harder to ignore the impact on individual North Carolina companies.

That residential solar tax credit “supports probably 50 percent of our total business and employment,” Etheridge tells INDY. Matt Abele, executive director of NC Sustainable Energy Association, pointed out that North Carolina is “number one in the country for rural clean energy jobs.”

While Democrats like Ross have openly railed against the bill (the Raleigh-area representative calls it the big ugly bill), business owners were gentler in lobbying legislators like Senator Thom Tills to try to soften the impact by phasing out the energy provisions over time.

“We knew the writing was on the wall,” Etheridge told INDY after the event. “But instead of having any kind of multi-year phase down, which would let the market and our teams adjust and prevent a lot of job loss and a lot of investment loss, we got a cliff at the end of this year.”

Tillis ultimately voted against the bill. But he didn’t, or couldn’t, help with that cliff. Ted Budd, North Carolina’s other senator, voted for the bill.

Shasten Jolley manages the Greentech Renewables branch in Garner. Jolley’s 70,000 square-foot warehouse, just next to Amazon’s RDU1 warehouse on Jones Sausage Road, is stocked with solar panels, inverters, and electrical components that Greentech sells to companies like Etheridge’s.

Jolley told INDY that Republican legislators might not fully understand the utility of renewable energy at a time when data centers and AI server farms have helped push the American thirst for energy to all-time highs.

“Solar and renewables are the quickest way to deploy, the cheapest way to deploy, new electrons to the grid,” Jolley said. “I think back in the olden days of solar and renewable energy it was a very hippie liberal movement [about] carbon reduction and climate change. And although it does help offset carbon, it is so much bigger than that now. This is an economics play, this is a manufacturing play. This is grid resilience and energy independence.”

The rollback is obviously a failure for Democrats like Ross, who had hoped that landmark legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act would help them hold the presidency in 2024. Now, they’re openly admitting that they didn’t really communicate its impact to the American people.

“It had a funny name, right?” Tampa-area congresswoman Kathy Castor said at the roundtable event. “It didn’t really convey that it was the single largest investment in clean energy and community resilience in history, bigger than anything any other country in the world had done.”

“We’re working really hard on being better messengers,” Ross said in response to an INDY question on the matter. “We’re not great because we still always speak in paragraphs and want to qualify everything, but we’re getting better.”

North Carolina businesses, meanwhile, will be scrambling to figure out how to survive after the sudden policy change.

“It’s about, for me, the jobs and the skills and the people and how we help them grow,” Etheridge told INDY. “And I think that’s obviously bipartisan.”

GM is now doubling down on affordable electric vehicles as their Ultium Cells plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee will be upgraded to produce “low-cost” lithium iron phosphate batteries. Work will begin later this year and production is scheduled to start in late 2027.

More: All-New Chevy Bolt EV Is Coming In 2025

The automaker isn’t saying much, but they’re “targeting significant battery pack cost savings” by embracing lithium iron phosphate technology. They noted the move also increases consumer choice as the company will continue to offer batteries with a nickel cobalt manganese aluminum chemistry.

GM’s vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability said, “This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio.”

There’s no word on which vehicles will be equipped with lithium iron phosphate batteries, but nearby Spring Hill Manufacturing makes the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq. However, the batteries are likely destined for affordable EVs and not luxury models.

GM Still Focused On LMR Batteries

While GM is excited about LFP batteries, President Mark Reuss focused on their recently announced lithium manganese rich (LMR) chemistry. He noted construction at the Ancker-Johnson Battery Cell Development Center in Michigan hit a milestone last month when the final steel beam was hoisted into place.

Once the facility opens, its first task is to “advance LMR batteries into production before anyone else.” Reuss added the center will “help reduce development times for new batteries by as much as a year.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Chevrolet-Blazer-EV-SS-Media-Drive-02158-copy.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 19:11:15.041280

CIVIC project spokesman

Thousands of homes in Detroit face the urgent need for home repairs and the growing burden of high energy costs.

The goal of our NSF CIVIC Project is to streamline repair assistance efforts and demonstrate how lower income homes and neighborhoods can benefit from decarbonization. The project integrates electrification factors into existing home assessment surveys in Detroit to focus repair efforts on decarbonization and help families access all available assistance resources.

Josh Elling, CEO, Jefferson East

Since 2013, Jefferson East has deployed more than $3.3 million in home repair resources, helping more than 4,500 residents throughout the East Jefferson corridor. Most of our repairs have been focused on ways to make homes more energy efficient, boost their weatherization, and make them more resilient to the challenges posed by a changing climate and extreme weather events.

Thanks to the National Science Foundation CIVIC Grant, we’ll be taking that work a step further by analyzing 50 homes to help figure out how we can help residents focus on decarbonization, electrification, and find ways to weave renewable energy into their homes.

Most of our people in the neighborhood, they’re living very modest lives; they’re not driving huge cars, they don’t have a huge energy burden. They’re not driving climate change, but they’re bearing the brunt of what climate change is bringing to them. What can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change? So all that goes together, we like to say we focus on resilient houses and resilient humans.

CIVIC project spokesman

Jefferson East’s work with Janice Bradford illustrates the impact coordinated assistance can make on Detroiters’ lives and energy use.

Janice Bradford, Detroit homeowner

I have a refrigerator that I was very much in need of because sometimes the freezer wouldn’t freeze or things is warm at the bottom. My furnace. I was four years in this home without a furnace at all. No furnace. I was freezing. It was dangerous to have your stove burning to try to keep you warm. I have a new AC unit in the home. I don’t have to worry about all the fans and things now. And I don’t take advantage of it, you know? I don’t want my bills to go up extremely high. If it’s just me, I say, well, I’ll be okay.

CIVIC project spokesman

Assessing homes is a critical first step. Through resident surveys and in-person energy assessments, researchers from Pecan Street and the University of Michigan can analyze and model the energy cost impact of various home improvement options.

Cavan Merski, Data Analyst, Pecan Street Inc.

One important part of our project is inputting the information we gather from the decarbonization module in the home assessment into energy modeling software.

This software simulates how the home uses energy and shows how that could change after repairs and energy efficiency upgrades are made. It combines details about the home, local weather data and utility rates to simulate how the home will use energy and the cost per time of use rate structures. This is crucial because we want to make sure the upgrades reduce energy expenses and increase the home’s longevity and the homeowners comfort.

We’re able to model different types of insulation and heat pump models to ensure the homeowner will save the most money while making their home as comfortable, safe, and healthy as possible.

Mike Walker, Green & Healthy Homes Initiative

I’m a native Detroiter, lived in the city all my life. When I’m standing in your living room helping to alleviate your home of health and safety, it’s rewarding. I’m not there to sell you anything. I’m there to help. So ultimately, we want to be successful and proven effective in Detroit.

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark.
She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments.
“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” Holdren said.
That’s why it’s important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday took another step to make it harder to find major, legally mandated scientific assessments of how climate change is endangering the nation and its people.

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark. Such sites tell state and local governments and the public what to expect in their backyards from a warming world and how best to adapt to it. At the time, the White House said NASA would house the reports to comply with a 1990 law that requires the reports, which the space agency said it planned to do.

But on Monday, NASA announced that it aborted those plans.

“The USGCRP (the government agency that oversees and used to host the report) met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov’s data,” NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens said in an email. That means no data from the assessment or the government science office that coordinated the work will be on NASA, she said.

On July 3, NASA put out a statement that said: “All preexisting reports will be hosted on the NASA website, ensuring continuity of reporting.”

“This document was written for the American people, paid for by the taxpayers, and it contains vital information we need to keep ourselves safe in a changing climate, as the disasters that continue to mount demonstrate so tragically and clearly,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments.

Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s library and the latest report and its interactive atlas can be seen here.

Former Obama White House science adviser and climate scientist John Holdren accused the administration of outright lying and long intended to censor or bury the reports.

“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” Holdren said. “In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology.”

“They simply don’t want the public to see the meticulously assembled and scientifically validated information about what climate change is already doing to our farms, forests, and fisheries, as well as to storms, floods, wildfires, and coast property — and about how all those damages will grow in the absence of concerted remedial action,” Holdren said in an email.

That’s why it’s important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said. He said they are written in a way that is “useful to people who need to understand what climate change is doing and will do to THEM, their loved ones, their property and their environment.”

“Trump doesn’t want people to know,” Holdren wrote.

The most recent report, issued in 2023, found that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority communities, particularly Native Americans, often disproportionately at risk.

The DfT said 23 new electric car models are available for less than £30,000.
“We are making it easier and cheaper to own an electric car,” said Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary.
However, in April the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, confirmed the Labour government would relax the rules after an intensive lobbying campaign by the UK car industry against the policy.","Buyers of new electric cars priced at less than £37,000 will be able to get a discount of up to 10% under a new UK government scheme, a move that may benefit some cheaper Chinese models but leave Tesla fans still having to pay the full price.

The £650m electric car grant will offer a discount of up to £3,750 for the “greenest” vehicles based on sustainability criteria, with a second band offering a discount of up to £1,500.

The move may benefit cheaper electric vehicle makers such as BYD, which has overtaken Tesla in sales in the UK. Prices of new cars built by Elon Musk’s company start from about £40,000.

John Lewis, the chief executive of the infrastructure company char.gy, said the reintroduction of the grant brings the UK closer to a point where “driving electric is accessible to everyone, not just the privileged few”.

The DfT said 23 new electric car models are available for less than £30,000. The government has pledged to ban the sale of new fully petrol or diesel cars and vans from 2030. Chinese EV brands have seized a growing slice of the European market, undercutting western marques to achieve more than 10% of European battery EV sales in some months of 2024.

“We are making it easier and cheaper to own an electric car,” said Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary. “This grant will not only allow people to keep more of their hard-earned money – it’ll help our automotive sector seize one of the biggest opportunities in the 21st century.”

The Conservative government under Rishi Sunak brought in the zero-emission vehicle mandate to force carmakers to sell an increasing proportion of electric cars or face steep fines of up to £15,000 for every vehicle above their fossil-fuel quota.

However, in April the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, confirmed the Labour government would relax the rules after an intensive lobbying campaign by the UK car industry against the policy. Carmakers argued they were being forced to make unsustainable discounts in order to attract buyers, although environmental campaigners had called for the government to hold firm.

“This new scheme could be just the shot in the arm needed to help more drivers go electric,” said Simon Williams, the head of policy at the RAC motoring organisation. “Within weeks discounted cars should start appearing at dealerships across the country. And, as the biggest savings will be given to cars with the strongest ‘green’ manufacturing credentials, drivers will be picking models that are not only better for their wallets but better for the planet too.”

However, this month figures showed that carmakers are on track to meet existing UK electric car sales targets despite the successful lobbying push.

Some buyers have been wary of going electric for a number of reasons, with higher upfront vehicle costs a key concern. “Range anxiety” caused by an inconsistent and sometimes expensive array of public charge points has also been a factor, although it is diminishing because of the rapid pace of public charger installations.

The government said there are now 82,000 public charge points available across the UK.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98dafebbb2f563aff059cc3b9f77cd32f0173ea0/1495_338_4286_3429/master/4286.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b51b28c2ba7ce84cd2a965cc7303abd,N,,2025-07-14 18:17:49.717774

“I feel a deep sense of responsibility to the British people to tell them the truth about what we know about the climate and nature crisis,” Miliband said.
Reform has pledged to scrap all net zero policies and subsidies for renewable energy.
But with polls showing a majority of Britons back current net zero policies, Miliband said this was a dangerous falsehood.
Miliband said while resilience policies were important, relying on them alone was “a complete betrayal, because then you’re essentially running up the down escalator.","Ed Miliband is to explicitly call out politicians who reject net zero policies for betraying future generations in an unprecedented update to parliament about the state of the climate crisis, which he is calling “an exercise in radical truth-telling”.

With Reform UK proposing to scrap all net zero measures and even questioning the science behind climate change, and the Conservatives ditching environmental targets, Miliband hopes to regain the initiative with a stark warning to MPs.

In what is planned to be an annual event, the energy security and net zero secretary will make a “state of the climate” address to the Commons setting out the findings of a new Met Office-led report that says the UK is already facing extreme weather and its effects.

“I feel a deep sense of responsibility to the British people to tell them the truth about what we know about the climate and nature crisis,” Miliband said. “I want this to become an annual statement where it’s an exercise in radical truth-telling about the state of the climate and nature.

“I think only by levelling with people about what we know can we win people’s trust about the need for action.”

The Met Office-led report spells out that with an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, and an increased period of flood-causing intense rain, the UK is already very much affected by the climate crisis.

Reform has pledged to scrap all net zero policies and subsidies for renewable energy. The Conservatives, who put into law the commitment to reach net zero by 2050 under Theresa May, abandoned the target this year.

Miliband said his statement would be a chance for such voices to be “held to account”. He said: “When I talk about this on Monday, all parties are going to have to decide how they respond. And those who respond by saying: ‘There’s nothing to worry about, we don’t need to do anything’ – frankly it is the worst sort of betrayal of today’s and future generations. They need to be called out, and we are going to call them out. We are not going to let the shared commitment that we need to tackle this crisis disappear by default.”

Miliband is routinely portrayed by political opponents and sections of the media as a climate zealot whose policies are unnecessary and will increase bills. But with polls showing a majority of Britons back current net zero policies, Miliband said this was a dangerous falsehood. “My position is the position of the vast majority of the British people,” he said. “The extremists, the ideologues, are those who would deny the problem or deny the need to act on the problem.

“I think history will judge those people very, very harshly because people will look back at this moment and they will say, you knew you were in this unique generational position, which is you knew enough about the gravity of the problem on the one hand, but on the other hand, it wasn’t too late to do something about it.

“People will ask who stood up and said yes, we must act, and who tried to deny the problem.”

Amid his warnings on Monday that the “British way of life” as it currently exists is threatened without proper action, Miliband said he also wanted to set out reasons for hope, including a gradually growing global consensus on net zero, and the prospect of the UK being a world leader in green technologies and policies.

He will also take issue with politicians who accept the broad science but argue that the world can cope simply by adapting to a changed climate.

Miliband said while resilience policies were important, relying on them alone was “a complete betrayal, because then you’re essentially running up the down escalator. The problem will get worse and worse. We keep trying to adapt. It will keep costing us more, and we won’t be able to keep up.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21ebe6f5d4d5cdb0047b0cc5b07d055bec819396/250_0_3731_2984/master/3731.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5346eece2650d08bb1fb245334422578,N,,2025-07-14 19:11:59.453939

An internal memo from Nissan Americas chairperson Christian Meunier pointed to an overall retracting sedan market, according to Auto News. The planned production of two sedans, “LZ1F” and “LZ1E,” were announced as cancelled in the memo, along with an electric crossover dubbed “PZ1L.”

Nissan’s audible comes during a turbulent patch for the electric vehicle industry, with federal tax credits for purchasing an EV set to end after Sept. 30. Plus, the overall automobile market has been tossed to and fro by the White House’s storm of tariffs, leading to ballooning costs or thinning margins for many vehicle makers.

In the most recent fiscal year, Nissan reported losses of nearly $5 billion.

But even if the short-term outlook is gloomy for EV production in Mississippi, the Japanese automaker still has big ideas for Canton.

Much of Nissan’s manufacturing is moving to the U.S., partially in response to tariff costs as well as soaring logistics prices, and Canton seems it will play a big role. According to CarScoops, a new electric SUV will begin production in Canton, along with an EV on the luxury Infiniti line beginning production in May 2028. The auto news outlet also hinted that a lightweight pickup truck could also join the assembly line.

While the Canton EV production projects were scrapped, there’s good reason to expect plenty more beyond the 2028 models. Data from the International Energy Agency reported a 25% increase in EV purchases from 2023 to 2024, with more than one in five of every car purchase now being electric.

The Houston Business Journal first reported this story.

The plant is set to break ground in 2027 and begin commercial operation by 2032 as part of the state's federally backed HyVelocity hydrogen hub. Called Project Labrador, the start date for the facility has become a critical element following the passage of the federal budget reconciliation package and its enactment on July 4.

The law amended the sunset clause of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—specifically Section 45V, which created a clean-hydrogen production tax credit of up to $3 per kilogram that could amount to nearly $3 billion over the program’s 10-year span.

The revisions now require these types of cleaner energy projects to begin construction before Jan. 1, 2028, according to the Congressional Record.

In filings to Jefferson County, Texas, Chevron requested a 10-year, 100% property-tax abatement, an incentive package that comparable southeast Texas energy projects suggest could exceed $50 million in foregone local taxes, according to regional analysts.

Known as HyVelocity, Chevron is a partner in the regional clean hydrogen hub, one of seven chosen by the U.S. Energy Department under the 2021 infrastructure law. The partnership includes AES Corp., Air Liquide, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Mitsubishi Power Americas, and Ørsted, working to produce and deliver lower-carbon hydrogen across the Gulf Coast.

HyVelocit's website explained how Project Labrador will capture and sequester CO₂ emissions through the company’s Bayou Bend carbon storage initiative, although specific capture rates and storage locales remain undisclosed.

As a founding member, Chevron was set to be able to tap into up to $1.2 billion in federal cooperative-agreement funding for HyVelocity, of which an initial $22 million was disbursed in November 2024 for early engineering and carbon‑capture activities, according to the hub’s website.

When it created the hubs, DOE said activities would create up to 45,000 jobs in the Gulf Coast region while sequestering as much as seven million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Austin Knight, vice president of Chevron New Energies for Hydrogen, said in a statement then that ""partnering and helping to connect value chains are key components to make hydrogen happen at scale.”

President Donald Trump has not voiced strong support for hydrogen hub funding, but DOE had earlier described Project Labrador as a benchmark for large-scale blue hydrogen deployment. Chevron did not respond to an ENR query on the amount of federal money allocated to Project Labrador funding.

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark.

That's why it's important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday took another step to make it harder to find major, legally mandated scientific assessments of how climate change is endangering the nation and its people.

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark. Such sites tell state and local governments and the public what to expect in their backyards from a warming world and how best to adapt to it. At the time, the White House said NASA would house the reports to comply with a 1990 law that requires the reports, which the space agency said it planned to do.

But on Monday, NASA announced that it aborted those plans.

“The USGCRP (the government agency that oversees and used to host the report) met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov’s data,"" NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens said in an email. That means no data from the assessment or the government science office that coordinated the work will be on NASA, she said.

On July 3, NASA put out a statement that said: ""All preexisting reports will be hosted on the NASA website, ensuring continuity of reporting.”

“This document was written for the American people, paid for by the taxpayers, and it contains vital information we need to keep ourselves safe in a changing climate, as the disasters that continue to mount demonstrate so tragically and clearly,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments.

Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's library and the latest report and its interactive atlas can be seen here.

Former Obama White House science adviser and climate scientist John Holdren accused the administration of outright lying and long intended to censor or bury the reports.

“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” Holdren said. “In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology.”

“They simply don’t want the public to see the meticulously assembled and scientifically validated information about what climate change is already doing to our farms, forests, and fisheries, as well as to storms, floods, wildfires, and coast property — and about how all those damages will grow in the absence of concerted remedial action,” Holdren said in an email.

That's why it's important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said. He said they are written in a way that is “useful to people who need to understand what climate change is doing and will do to THEM, their loved ones, their property and their environment.""

“Trump doesn't want people to know,” Holdren wrote.

The most recent report, issued in 2023, found that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority communities, particularly Native Americans, often disproportionately at risk.

David Toland, a Democrat who doubles as the Kansas commerce secretary, said he’s not concerned about current economic conditions because the EV industry has grown overall.
In 2022, Kansas offered $829 million in tax incentives to convince the tech giant to build its newest, largest battery plant in the state.
Tax incentives at the local level require Panasonic to hire at least 2,500 full-time employees.
The Kansas News Service is a collaboration of KCUR, Kansas Public Radio, KMUW and High Plains Public Radio focused on health, the social determinants of health and their connection to public policy.","At Panasonic’s massive battery plant in De Soto on Monday, Kansas political leaders stood beside Japanese dignitaries on stage with wooden mallets in their hands.

They huddled together to perform “kagami wari,” a Japanese ceremony marking new beginnings. On the count of three, they plunged their mallets into white wooden sake casks, “Panasonic Energy” labels facing out.

The event drew lawmakers at every level, foreign media and major business leaders to celebrate the start of production. Officials said batteries started rolling down the line a week ago with 1,100 workers hired so far.

The company aims to employ 4,000 people by the end of 2026. And Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said the plant is expected to bring $2.5 billion of economic activity to the state each year.

Republican U.S. Senator Jerry Moran said the development represented the largest private investment in state history.

“This is a day of joy,” he said. “This is a major accomplishment for Panasonic and for the state of Kansas.”

That cheerful mood prevailed despite serious headwinds in the electric vehicle industry, which some fear could keep the 4.7 million-square-foot battery factory from reaching its full potential — and its hiring goals.

Tesla, tariffs and taxes

Republican President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs that would make it more expensive to manufacture EVs. Tesla, the nation’s largest EV maker, recently saw its profits dip amid CEO Elon Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration’s sweeping funding cuts and federal employee layoffs.

And as part of Trump’s seismic tax and spending bill that recently passed, a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchasers will end in September. Those tax credits were created during Democratic President Joe Biden’s term.

Allan Swan, President of Panasonic Energy North America, told reporters that turbulence in the EV market is to be expected.

“We're in a brand new industry,” he said. “So that industry's going to ebb and flow a little bit as she grows — and she will grow.”

At full capacity, Swan said the facility will produce 70 batteries per second for Tesla, Toyota, Lucid, Hexagon Purus and Harbinger Motors.

As for concerns about tariffs on products used to manufacture batteries, especially from China, Swan said Panasonic is working on finding more options to create “a stronger supply chain.”

De Soto Mayor Rick Walker shared Swan’s optimism for the long-term health of the EV industry. To take advantage of the tax credit before it expires, Walker recently bought an EV of his own — though he went for a cheaper option than a Tesla.

“I really like the car, even if I don't like the guy that is the front for it,” he said, referring to Musk.

A good deal?

Lt. Gov. David Toland, a Democrat who doubles as the Kansas commerce secretary, said he’s not concerned about current economic conditions because the EV industry has grown overall.

“We think that's going to continue in North America and, long term, this facility is going to be a huge win for the people of Kansas,” he said.

In 2022, Kansas offered $829 million in tax incentives to convince the tech giant to build its newest, largest battery plant in the state. That includes $500 million in tax credits in exchange for the company spending $4 billion to build the plant.

The city of De Soto later signed a separate tax incentive agreement to help fund the construction of public infrastructure needed to operate the plant.

Skeptics say deals like that often weigh heavily in businesses’ favor, without providing enough assurance that beneficiaries will provide high-quality jobs and investments in return.

In Kansas’ agreement with Panasonic, the company must spend a certain amount and stay in the state for 15 years to earn the full extent of the discounts on offer. Tax incentives at the local level require Panasonic to hire at least 2,500 full-time employees.

That deal was reached during a competition between Kansas and Oklahoma for the project. Toland said the incentives are a necessary burden for states looking to lure economic investment.

“Every single state in the country has incentives to attract and retain businesses,” Toland said. “So the notion that we should simply step away and put down all of our weapons while other states are fully armed, I think is not wise.”

All else being equal, those upper-echelon households don’t necessarily need a tax break to keep buying electric vehicles.
Despite the higher up-front cost, the total cost of ownership (TCO) for electric vehicles is already competitive with gasmobiles, partly due to the cost of gasoline.
New home buyers that may have been locked out of EV charging in their former situation can now walk into a more seamless environment for electric vehicles.
“Even amid today’s uncertain landscape — from shifting tariffs to evolving U.S. policy — many companies remain committed to their goals for electric vehicle adoption,” Trellis stated.","“With LFP battery technology, GM is targeting significant battery pack cost savings compared to today’s high-nickel battery pack while increasing consumer EV choice,” Ultium emphasized.

This Is Why Electric Vehicles Are Here To Stay

Of course, loss of the tax credit is going take some steam out of the electric vehicle movement here in the US. Or, will it? As pointed out by CleanTechnica editor Zachary Shahan, the new tax bill will most likely spark a short term surge in demand for EVs, which could help stimulate the demand for a more favorable tax policy in the near future.

That remains to be seen. However, loss of the tax credit may not be the deal-breaker that anti-EV lawmakers are hoping for. From the beginning, the up-front cost of owning an electric vehicle was a bridge too far for households on a budget, leaving the field to higher-income households. All else being equal, those upper-echelon households don’t necessarily need a tax break to keep buying electric vehicles. They just need a good reason to make the switch to electric mobility.

If you’re thinking that a spike in the cost of gasoline is an effective motivator, that’s one key factor. Despite the higher up-front cost, the total cost of ownership (TCO) for electric vehicles is already competitive with gasmobiles, partly due to the cost of gasoline.

Another important consideration is the unlocking of new markets in the higher income brackets. As recently reported by Electrical Contractor Magazine, new home builders are installing EV-supporting wiring hand over fist. New home buyers that may have been locked out of EV charging in their former situation can now walk into a more seamless environment for electric vehicles.

Millions of renters and owners in multi-household buildings are also among those currently locked out of the opportunity to charge up at home. If even a small fraction of them had access to EV charging on the premises, that would make have a huge impact on the pace of electric vehicle sales, as surveys consistently show that the overwhelming majority of EV owners prefer to charge up at home.

Innovative startups are beginning to uncork that bottleneck with new charging-as-a-service options that enable property-owning entities to obtain on-site EV chargers without up-front costs. The installer takes on all the headaches including ongoing operation and maintenance chores.

Electric Vehicles Are Coming For Your Fleet

The fleet electrification movement is another pressure point that can contribute momentum to the EV sales picture in the US. In one particularly interesting development in that area, Siemens has begun marketing a new accounting service that enables fleet managers to accurately reimburse employees who recharge their company cars at home, even if other electric vehicles use the same charger.

In April, the analytics firm Trellis Group took stock of the impact of both tariffs and tax laws on the fleet electrification situation in the US. “Even amid today’s uncertain landscape — from shifting tariffs to evolving U.S. policy — many companies remain committed to their goals for electric vehicle adoption,” Trellis stated.

“Despite higher acquisition costs, fleet owners are more satisfied with EVS than with internal combustion vehicles, according to the survey,” Trellis added, citing a Cox Automotive survey. “They deliver lower costs over the lifetime of a vehicle, higher efficiency and cleaner operations.”

What do you think, is there enough momentum in to overcome the obstacles set forth in the new tax bill, along with the “TACO” Trump tariffs, and anything else the anti-EV movement can throw into the pot?",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/electric-vehicles-cadillac-lyriq-gm.png,N,,2025-07-14 22:07:27.001701

New 2025 Car Loan Tax Deduction: Which Vehicles and Buyers Qualify

We’ve recently seen the creation of a new income tax deduction for interest paid on loans financing the purchase of qualified passenger vehicles. The deduction covers purchases made in 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028.

What defines a “qualified passenger vehicle”?

To qualify for the tax deduction, the vehicle must follow these guidelines:

Personal use only: The vehicle must be used for personal use, meaning no business or commercial vehicles will qualify for this deduction.

New vehicles only: This can include new SUVs, new trucks, and new cars.

“Final assembly” in the US: The final assembly of the vehicle will have to take place in the United States to qualify for the deduction. Our salespeople will be able to help you find the models assembled in the US.

Weight limit: The vehicle must weigh less than 14,000 pounds.

Who is eligible to take the tax break?

This deduction is for all eligible vehicle buyers, no matter if they itemize their deductions or take the standard deduction on their yearly tax returns.

How much interest can be deducted?

Qualifying buyers can deduct up to but no more than $10,000 in interest per year.

Do I need special documentation?

Your loan servicer will provide you with a tax form to claim the deduction, which includes information about the vehicle you purchase, the VIN (vehicle identification number), and details about the loan. Spitzer Acura will have more information about this form in the future.",https://di-uploads-pod23.dealerinspire.com/spitzeracura/uploads/2019/07/SptizerAcura-OG-200x200.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 03:03:42.269581

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark.

“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” Holdren said.
That’s why it’s important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday took another step to make it harder to find major, legally mandated scientific assessments of how climate change is endangering the nation and its people.

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark. Such sites tell state and local governments and the public what to expect in their backyards from a warming world and how best to adapt to it. At the time, the White House said NASA would house the reports to comply with a 1990 law that requires the reports, which the space agency said it planned to do.

But on Monday, NASA announced that it aborted those plans.

“The USGCRP (the government agency that oversees and used to host the report) met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov’s data,” NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens said in an email. That means no data from the assessment or the government science office that coordinated the work will be on NASA, she said.

On July 3, NASA put out a statement that said: “All preexisting reports will be hosted on the NASA website, ensuring continuity of reporting.”

“This document was written for the American people, paid for by the taxpayers, and it contains vital information we need to keep ourselves safe in a changing climate, as the disasters that continue to mount demonstrate so tragically and clearly,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments.

Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s library and the latest report and its interactive atlas can be seen here.

Former Obama White House science adviser and climate scientist John Holdren accused the administration of outright lying and long intended to censor or bury the reports.

“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” Holdren said. “In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology.”

“They simply don’t want the public to see the meticulously assembled and scientifically validated information about what climate change is already doing to our farms, forests, and fisheries, as well as to storms, floods, wildfires, and coast property — and about how all those damages will grow in the absence of concerted remedial action,” Holdren said in an email.

That’s why it’s important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said. He said they are written in a way that is “useful to people who need to understand what climate change is doing and will do to THEM, their loved ones, their property and their environment.”

“Trump doesn’t want people to know,” Holdren wrote.

The most recent report, issued in 2023, found that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority communities, particularly Native Americans, often disproportionately at risk.

Eight awardees from all corners of Michigan will become the first MI Solar for All pilots, awarded in round one of the Solar for Savings (SFS) grants opportunity. SFS is the first of a series of MI Healthy Climate Challenge (MHC Challenge) grant competitions to drive clean energy deployment and unlock additional investment across Michigan.

The Office of Climate and Energy (OCE) in the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) announced the awards today. Together, they tentatively total about $7.9 million – a number subject to change as the OCE works with awardees in the coming weeks to finalize grant agreements.

Projects are focused on deploying solar projects to help low-income participants save money by reducing energy costs or providing other benefits, improving energy resilience, and supporting Michigan’s energy independence through greater solar access across Michigan communities. Grants were awarded in two categories:

Residential rooftop solar projects

Hope Village Revitalization, Wayne County: Retrofit 10 homes in Detroit and Highland Park with rooftop solar, battery storage, weatherization and high efficiency, dual fuel, cold climate heat pumps, with a goal of scaling the program to 100 homes.

Southwest Housing Solutions Corp., doing business as MiSide Housing, Oakland County: Install solar on a 60-unit multifamily building serving low-income vulnerable seniors, including formerly homeless seniors, with solar benefits to fund part of the time for a service coordinator position for residents.

Superior Watershed Partnership, covering all Upper Peninsula counties: Install solar at 15 households. At least five households will receive energy storage. Critical care customers with medical devices dependent on electricity will be prioritized. Installations will provide electricity cost reductions to low-income households and, in cases with energy storage, added resiliency.

Residential-serving community solar projects

City of Benton Harbor, Berrien County: Install solar at city facilities. Benefits will be provided to eligible low-income beneficiaries on city water bills.

Hillsdale Board of Public Utilities, Hillsdale County: Install ground-mounted solar at a municipal airport with pollinator-friendly plants. Low-income benefits will be provided on utility bills.

Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Chippewa County: Install solar and storage at 12 residential homes and a community building to support resiliency, provided as electric bill offset to 12 households or through community programs focused on energy assistance or food security.

Lowell Light & Power, Kent County: Install solar canopies over the main parking lot at Stoney Lakeside Park for high visibility and community education with benefits provided on utility bills in an opt-out program.

North End Woodward Community Coalition, Wayne County: Expand the Solar Neighbors initiative to install solar, owned by a community trust.

The proposals serve as pilot projects laying the groundwork for the broader MI Solar for All (MI SFA) program, a federally funded initiative to bring solar energy to low-income households and communities statewide.

MI SFA will provide direct financial assistance for rooftop solar, community solar, energy storage, and upgrades, as well as workforce development, community outreach, and technical assistance opportunities. Participating households are expected to receive a benefit equivalent to an average 20% reduction on their electricity bill.

Michigan received $156 million for MI SFA through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All competition.

The state initially allocated $8.875 million for Solar for Savings but now has approved up to $20 million more to fund pilot projects that will broaden the knowledge base for MI SFA. Applications have closed for the first two rounds of Solar for Savings but remain open until 5 p.m. Sept. 30 for the third round. Awards will be made first-come, first-served, and each round’s applicants will remain eligible in subsequent rounds. To learn more and apply, visit Michigan.gov/MHCChallenge.

Beyond Solar for Savings, the MHC Challenge will offer multiple funding opportunities to help build momentum around clean energy initiatives statewide. Future grant competitions will focus on helping communities and partners leverage federal tax credits, expanding access to green lending, and unlocking large-scale climate financing for high-impact climate projects. Eligibility will vary by competition, but the MHC Challenge is designed to include a wide range of public and private participants – including local governments, community lenders, schools, faith organizations, nonprofits, and solar providers.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/EGLE-Logos/Social.jpg?rev=fa9af8ebc6cc48f4ab7777c144d928b5&hash=AD089C78988ABC2E4DD23E2D36B9B8E6,N,,2025-07-14 17:18:08.836979

Japanese ambassador Shigeo Yamada highlighted the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, saying Japan has been the strongest investor in the United States in the past 50 years and has created 1 million jobs.","DE SOTO — Hundreds from around the world gathered Monday to celebrate the grand opening of the Panasonic electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto and tour the 4.7 million-square-foot facility that claims the tag of the state’s biggest economic development project ever.

The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Panasonic leaders, and local, regional and national elected officials praised the partnership required to bring the project to fruition. Panasonic is expected to invest $4 billion in the plant, and the Kansas Department of Commerce estimates it will bring $2.5 billion to the state’s economy annually.

The state offered $829 million in incentives to Panasonic through the Attracting Powerful Economic Expansion Act, or APEX.

“Just two and a half years ago, November 22, we stood on this very ground,” said Allan Swan, president and chief operating officer of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America. “At that point, it was just a big open field, but we had a whole vision to build a world-class facility that would power the future of clean transportation, create thousands of jobs, new high-quality jobs, and serve as the catalyst for economic growth in Kansas and across the region.”

“Today,” he said, “that vision is a reality.”

One week ago, the first production line began operating, and it will take three to four months for it to achieve full capacity, Swan said after the ceremony.

By early January, Swan said, three additional lines will be operating and construction will begin on a second wing of the building, which is expected to house an additional four lines in about 18 months.

Currently, the plant makes about 50,000 batteries per day — at a rate of about 70 per second — and employs 1,100 people, Swan said. It is expected to employ 4,000 people when at full capacity.

Reports by international media that decreased Tesla sales will delay the move to full capacity are just part of being in a new business, Swan said.

“We’re in a brand new industry,” he said. “That industry is going to ebb and flow a little bit as she grows, and she will grow, and we’re clearly growing in one direction. It’s not going to change. The beauty of Kansas is we can build these lines out. We’ve got customers that want them, so we should be in a good place.”

Batteries won’t begin to ship out to customers for three or four weeks because of rigorous safety and quality testing, Swan said.

The marketplace

Customers who will use the electric vehicle batteries in their products were in attendance, including representatives from Lucid Motors, Toyota, Harbinger Motors and Tesla. Nick Twork, spokesman for Lucid, said they were pleased to see a new plant built.

“It’s really great because obviously it allows us to have a domestic supply chain for battery cells,” he said. “This facility will start supplying us next year, and we’ll ship batteries to our factory in Arizona.”

Upcoming changes to U.S. policies, like eliminating tax credits for buying electric cars, aren’t really something that concerns Lucid, Twork said.

“As long as it’s a level playing field, that’s the most important thing,” he said. “Obviously that’s going to affect the marketplace, so we’ll adapt as necessary. We’re an agile business, and we’ll do what it takes.”

Twork said he wasn’t willing to comment on any acrimony the public is feeling about Tesla products and reports the company’s sales are down.

“From our standpoint, we’ve had six consecutive quarters of record growth for the company,” he said. “We keep selling more vehicles, so more and more customers are finding out about

what Lucid has to offer.”

Supply chains

U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran spoke at the ceremony and afterward said trade negotiations need to take place to get rid of barriers that keep U.S. products out of international markets.

“But as I’ve indicated to the ambassador today, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that the outcome of those conversations between Japan and the United States are beneficial to both countries,” Moran said.

The federal government wants supply chains brought home, he said.

“This is an example of where business that was being done outside the United States will now be done in the United States,” he said of the Panasonic plant.

Swan said Panasonic is working to bring more suppliers to locate in the United States. Three already have space in the De Soto plant.

“It’s an ongoing process, and we’ll keep working with our suppliers who already exist to see whether we can get them here to the United States, or find another way of creating a stronger supply chain,” Swan said.

There are still 6,000 acres near the plant that could be used for expansion or where suppliers could build. Swan said the company would like to see that developed and is working with the state of Kansas to bring suppliers “as close as possible.”

Swan praised the De Soto plant as the largest plant his company has built with top-of-the-line manufacturing capabilities.

“We built the first one with Tesla over in Nevada, so that’s their factory. This is our factory,” he said. “We’ve redesigned it to make it quite more productive. There is roughly 10% less machinery here and a lot more automation, so that’s where the innovation comes in. The lines here are the fastest lines that we’ve ever had.”

The labor-saving production lines are expected to achieve approximately 20% higher productivity compared to the Nevada factory, a press release said.

Workforce training

All of those who spoke Monday highlighted the partnerships that it took to make such a large project successful. Speakers repeatedly mentioned the collaboration with local community colleges to help the company train the workforce it needs.

Greg Mosier, president of the Kansas City Kansas Community College, said new programs at the school train Panasonic’s entry level skilled maintenance technicians and advanced engineering technicians.

The program is a mix of schooling at the community college and working at the Panasonic plant, he said.

“We developed it in partnership with Panasonic, and then it’s also 16 credit hours, so they get a college certificate with it as well,” Mosier said. “It’s an apprenticeship model, so they are on the regular 16-week schedule. They do two days at the college, three days at the factory.”

In response to a Panasonic request, the community college was able to condense the program to eight weeks, he said. After completing the course and working full time at Panasonic, Mosier said, students are earning $50,000 to $60,000 per year.

Japanese investment

The investments Panasonic is making in Kansas will strengthen the state’s economy and do much more, said Yasuaki Takamoto, CEO of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America.

“What happens here is just the first step in building a stable and secure domestic supply chain, one that’s becoming a reality thanks to our ongoing investment and partnership,” he said. “We are supporting domestic production with critical EV components, strengthening North America’s manufacturing ecosystems and helping America maintain its competitive edge.”

Takamoto said that selecting Kansas for the plant meant choosing the community and the workforce they believed in.

“Since then, we built relationships that will last for years to come,” he said.

Japanese ambassador Shigeo Yamada highlighted the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, saying Japan has been the strongest investor in the United States in the past 50 years and has created 1 million jobs.

“Japanese investment in this country is about much more than just dollars and cents,” he said. “By working hand-in-hand with local communities, Japanese companies are building enduring ties and a sense of trust with their peoples. These personal ties — connections — form the very foundation on which the bilateral relationship is built and allowing us to collaborate, not just as allies, but as trusted friends.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/p1010181-1024x5761752526146.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=oqSpZeJu,N,,2025-07-14 19:11:33.806776

For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.","Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.

The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would ""make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.""

That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.

Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.

At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.

Here's what to know.

The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in ""qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,"" beginning with 2025 purchases.

While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.

Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?

The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.

To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.

The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.

What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?

The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.

Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.

Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.

How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?

An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.

How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?

That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.

Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan, according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.

At a 9.3% interest rate — typical of people with subprime credit scores — an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.

How do—or how did—USAID and other development organizations fit into this energy transition?

We will see how long this feeling of emancipation lasts and whether the new government can somehow pick up the momentum of Lebanon’s recent energy transition.","As the Trump administration’s cuts to USAID reverberate throughout the world, Lebanon—a famously aid-dependent country and a frontline state in the transnational confrontation between the United States and the Iran-aligned “Axis of Resistance”—is undergoing an unprecedented energy transition with the ostensible support of international donors. Camillo Stubenberg, a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Cornell, studies the adoption of decentralized electricity technologies in Lebanon—a sector that USAID had been trying to support. In this Q&A with Century International fellow Zachary Cuyler, Stubenberg talks about the role of USAID in Lebanon’s solar boom and the possible impact of Trump’s aid cuts.

Zachary Cuyler: How much assistance did USAID provide to Lebanon? What’s been the overall impact of the Trump administration’s cuts to USAID?

Camillo Stubenberg: We do not, at the moment, know how much less the United States is spending on aid to Lebanon, so it’s somewhat hard to know exactly what the effects of cuts will be. One leaked document suggests that only 29 percent of all USAID assistance to Lebanon has been cut. Others think it’s more. There are many unknowns—among them, what the ultimate disposition of USAID will be once the dust settles from the ongoing lawsuits challenging the Trump cuts.

However, it’s clear that the Trump cuts will have a substantial impact. The United States oscillates between being the largest and second-largest bilateral donor to Lebanon. In 2024, Washington spent around $329 million in the country. About half of American support goes to the Lebanese Armed Forces—this assistance comes through Department of State programs. On the development front, USAID is active in various sectors, from health care to water and sanitation, community development, agricultural development, support for businesses and industries, and—more recently—energy.

One recently laid-off project manager I spoke to joked, “You know what? The only negative impact of the cuts is that all the people like me are losing their jobs.” That is certainly the most immediate, palpable effect of the financing cuts: stop-work orders that, in many instances, translated into firings. But we’re not talking about just a few people losing jobs. With Lebanon’s entire economic output being something like $28 billion—which, by the way, is a third lower than it was before the economy imploded seven or eight years ago—the aid cuts could represent a small but significant macroeconomic shock. And for a certain segment of Lebanese society, that is a massive, immediate, and very scary effect. It’s visible in terms of employment of a certain kind of middle-to-upper-middle-class, educated set of Lebanese who were able to live a decent life because of the good salaries in the aid sector.

One level up, I think it remains to be seen how much this will impact institutions such as the Michel Daher Foundation and the Renee Moawad Foundation (which are economic development nonprofits that USAID supported), and, below them, the various municipalities and the mayors or heads of unions of municipalities who had good ties with USAID. USAID was kind of an intermediary between these projects, these communities, and American aid money. Its role and standing will likely be diminished: there might not be any more mediating to do.

Zachary: Your research focuses on Lebanon’s post-2021 energy transition. How do—or how did—USAID and other development organizations fit into this energy transition? And how do the Trump cuts affect the transition, if at all?

Camillo: Lebanon’s energy transition was born out of severe fuel shortages in 2021, and it was decentralized—it happened on a household level, rather than being centrally planned. Lebanon’s state electricity utility, Electricite du Liban (EDL) had struggled to supply sufficient power since the Lebanese Civil War, which ended in 1990. A system of private neighborhood generators emerged to meet the gap. Under this “dual” energy regime, citizens relied on a cheap but ineffective state utility on the one hand, and functional but very expensive private generators on the other.

This system collapsed in 2021 when fuel shortages disrupted power generation both by EDL power plants and by the private generators. What ensued was an almost total blackout, since both sources of electricity were based on a functioning fossil fuel supply chain. Households scrambled to find an alternative, and solar power became the country’s hottest commodity.

Almost overnight, solar panels proliferated, and households became independent of both the state grid and private generators.

Private, small-scale solar entrepreneurs led this shift. Almost overnight, solar panels proliferated, and households became independent of both the state grid and private generators. However, this emancipation from the old “dual” energy regime brought new constraints and connections. What were previously collective questions became intimate. In my dissertation I describe this as life under the patronage of the sun. This change not only restructured how families went about their daily life (“we only run the washing machine on sunny days”) but also affected the way companies went about their business. Industries that had “solarized” their operations were now organizing their processes according to the rhythm of the sun. For instance, one food producer cancelled night shifts because it was more cost-effective to only operate when electricity was effectively free, during the day. Quite old, preindustrial temporal and spatial patterns of energy usage returned to both daily life and the broader political economy.

Lebanon’s energy landscape has changed dramatically, but not because of the intervention of international aid agencies or the Lebanese government. The transition had previously revolved around foreign-funded pilot projects meant to demonstrate the decarbonization benefits of solar and to form the basis for future larger-scale policies. But the rapid adoption of off-grid solar systems was entirely driven by private households and businesses seeking to increase their energy security. And many of the Lebanese I’ve spoken to are quite proud of the grassroots nature of this transition.

Zachary: Given how much the energy transition in Lebanon was driven both by necessity and by Lebanese people’s responses to this very complex, overlapping set of crisis conditions, what kind of support did USAID actually provide? And who did USAID tend to partner with for these projects?

Camillo: Before the 2021 energy crisis, USAID was financing a handful of solar projects under the framework of its Community Support Program. Solar panels would be installed to support local concerns like schools, wells, or small businesses. In Baaloul, for instance, a program called Baladi tried to support local rural economies and provided a grant to install a solar-powered irrigation system. Donors might provide small grants to an olive press to get some solar panels. But these were pretty niche, sometimes gimmicky projects.

But with the financial and energy crises, donors—including USAID—were dumbfounded as to how to proceed. Sam Heller’s 2023 Century International report on Lebanese aid described how donors were increasingly reluctant to spend any money that would go directly to Lebanese institutions at the national level. But the energy crisis was on everyone’s mind, including among international staffers living in Lebanon.

The main USAID response to the Lebanese energy crisis was a project called Inara, or Innovation for Affordable and Renewable Energy for All, which began in 2021 with a $29 million grant for decentralized energy access at the municipal level. The idea was that Inara would improve small sections of the EDL grid rather than attempting to fix the whole thing. Thus, in contrast to previous plans of building one or several large new power plants on the coast that would reduce electricity shortages in the entire country, Inara proposed to build new generation capacity near certain target communities.

The project had two phases. The first “trial” case was the refurbishing of one of Lebanon’s oldest hydropower plants in Rechmaya. The surrounding villages would receive at least eight hours of electricity per day, up from about one hour per day. The second phase of the project foresaw the building of a seven-megawatt solar farm that would benefit a particular set of villages.

The idea definitely had appeal. It was a way to leverage the impact of relatively small renewable energy projects to make a significant difference for local beneficiaries: eight hours of electricity per day is much better than one. That localized benefit was important because, otherwise, the benefit of the new installations would be diluted across the country. If Inara had panned out, it would have been replicable, and the grid might have been rebuilt piece by piece.

But Inara faced many challenges and delays even before the stop-work order came from Washington early in 2025. Today, the Rechmaya plant has been fixed, but the second phase of the project was halted just when it was about to start the tendering process. That’s a real pity, because now we don’t know if Inara’s proposition of rebuilding the grid locally through this kind of patchwork approach is feasible.

Zachary: So what went wrong?

Camillo: The reasons for Inara’s difficulties reveal quite a lot about both the general difficulties of doing energy projects in Lebanon as well as the specific challenges that come with the USAID approach.

First, working with EDL is difficult. The company has a well-earned reputation for being dysfunctional to the core—corrupt, politicized, and wildly inefficient. EDL has a complicated and politicized governance structure, and also lacks basic operational capacity. One Inara employee explained to me that they would have to pick up their counterparts to go to visit field sites and even had to supply basic materials such as printer paper because of the dire economic circumstances of EDL.

The second challenge was to get local communities to buy into the project. With Rechmaya, there was a lot of pushback from farmers who had been using the river’s water for the many years that the power plant had been broken. The repair of the hydropower plant by USAID meant that they could no longer control the flow of water into their orchards and fields. Inara also had a lot of trouble finding the right target community for the solar component of the project. The set of villages had to be the right size for the planned seven-megawatt solar plant, they had to get along with each other, and—importantly—the project had to exclude any Hezbollah-led municipalities. The search for a technically and politically feasible project within these parameters took much longer than expected. In the end, Inara settled on Deir El Ahmar, a Lebanese Forces stronghold in the northern Bekaa valley.

Beyond these challenges, donors and local Lebanese partners have long complained about coordination problems with USAID. The agency is isolated—literally and figuratively. Its offices are in the highly fortified embassy north of Beirut. And the agency is also known to be secretive. I remember the UNDP and other people saying they had “no idea what these guys are doing.” Lebanese ministries and other aid agencies made similar comments.

Zachary: You mention that the community Inara chose was a stronghold of the Lebanese Forces, a right-wing Christian party-militia that is a rival of Hezbollah. What role did American political aims play in planning aid? And what were the consequences of those aims?

Camillo: In terms of USAID policies—or its role as a source of patronage—it was a key goal not only to preserve the multi-sectarian character of Lebanon, but also—and the agency has openly said this—to counter Hezbollah’s narrative and influence.

The United States also doesn’t want to have some new infrastructure that USAID paid for covered with Hezbollah flags, or to have a Hezbollah mayor say, “We did that.” And Hezbollah wouldn’t want that either—it’s a two-way street. There were also legal considerations. It all added up to a lengthening of the USAID implementation process, which was already famously bureaucratic and complicated.

USAID is also clearly more comfortable working with organizations and companies that are politically oriented toward the West, and which might have investments in North America and Europe.

The upshot of all of this is that USAID assistance tends to go to predominantly Christian, Sunni, Druze, and mixed villages—not predominantly Shia villages where Hezbollah or its allies are in charge. You can imagine the types of perceptions this creates in Lebanon, which has so many political and sectarian divisions. Passing through the Beqaa Valley, I’ve seen USAID plaques—“Funded by the American People”—riddled with bullet holes. Targeted, presumably, in opposition to what people perceive as U.S. imperialism.

Zachary: Are there any silver linings to the cuts, or anything we can learn from them?

Camillo: In the broadest sense, these aid cuts are a net negative. Even if there was an argument for reducing U.S. assistance to Lebanon, the way the Trump administration did it was completely irresponsible. At the same time, the cuts do provide an opportunity to consider the structural flaws with the aid regime.

One flaw is that bureaucracy seriously dampened the impacts of aid. It’s still very unclear what the effects of the cuts will be on big energy sector projects. I’m personally tempted to say that this experience has shown how incredibly inefficient it is to spend money through aid agencies. Inara spent $29 million, and doesn’t have much to show for it. A lot of work was done—legal, strategic, political—aligning EDL with the local municipality, getting some kind of contractual security. This was all hard work for the people who did it. But for the actual end-beneficiaries, nothing happened. There’s an argument to be made that it would have been better just to transfer $29 million to households to defray the costs of solar panels or higher-quality batteries.

Still, a curious outcome of the halt of U.S. foreign aid is that there appears to be astonishingly little immediate, day-to-day impact. Critics of development assistance might see this as evidence supporting their argument that development aid is too inefficient. And both in Lebanese media and among people I talk to, there is also a sense of emancipation that comes with the USAID breakdown—a kind of opportunity to take one’s development trajectory back into one’s own hands. We will see how long this feeling of emancipation lasts and whether the new government can somehow pick up the momentum of Lebanon’s recent energy transition.

This update details changes made by the Act to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA or the Act),[1] which enacts significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax benefits available to clean energy projects. The text of the Act can be found here. Our prior alert on the tax highlights of the Act can be found here.

This alert provides further details regarding the changes made by the OBBBA to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).[2]

Wind and Solar Energy (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying wind and solar projects were eligible for a production tax credit (PTC) under section 45Y or an investment tax credit (ITC) under section 48E. Under the IRA, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC were subject to phase-out following the later of 2032 or the year the Treasury Secretary determined that the annual greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) from the production of electricity in the United States was equal to or less than 25 percent of a 2022 baseline. Our prior alert on the section 45Y and 48E credits can be found here.

Under pre-OBBBA IRS guidance (first issued in 2014), a wind or solar project that began construction would qualify for ITCs or PTCs if it was placed in service by the end of the fourth calendar year after the year in which construction began (assuming other applicable requirements are met).[3] Construction of a project was deemed to “begin” by the performance of physical work of a significant nature or by satisfying a safe harbor through payment or incurrence of at least five percent of certain project costs.[4] That pre-OBBBA IRS guidance contains rules governing the type of “physical work” that qualifies but specifically provides that “there is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required to satisfy” the physical work standard.[5]

Projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026

Under the Act, qualifying wind and solar projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to be eligible for ITCs and PTCs.

Projects that begin construction on or before July 4, 2026[6]

As of the date of this alert (July 14, 2025), the section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC placement-in-service deadline is uncertain for qualifying wind and solar projects that began construction before July 4, 2026 and thus are exempt from the December 31, 2027 placement-in-service deadline.

This uncertainty stems from President Trump’s July 7, 2025 Executive Order that directed the Treasury Secretary, by August 18, 2025, to “strictly enforce the termination of the [section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC] for wind and solar facilities,” which includes

issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

Both the scope of the Executive Order and the manner in which it will be interpreted are unclear, and we will publish another alert once this guidance is issued.

Certain Leasing Arrangements

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA prohibits the section 48E ITC for qualified investments in certain small wind facilities (used in connection with a residential dwelling unit by the lessee) if the taxpayer rents or leases the facilities to a third party, and disallows the section 45Y PTC with respect to electricity produced by such facilities during those taxable years.

Application of the prohibition is uncertain with respect to facilities generating electricity from solar energy. The heading of the provision states that it applies to “solar leasing arrangements,” but the prohibition by its terms (and a potentially errant cross-reference) applies to solar water heating property, which is not eligible for either the section 48E ITC or section 45Y PTC in the first instance.

Foreign Entity of Concern Rules (FEOC)

The OBBBA also introduces new section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC eligibility requirements that target certain foreign (e.g., China) ownership or influence with respect to benefited projects and participation in supply chains (collectively, “Foreign Restrictions”).[7] As discussed below, some or all of the restrictions also apply to various other credits.

More specifically, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC are not allowed to a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (FIE), nor are they allowed with respect to a facility the construction of which receives “material assistance” from an SFE or an FIE. These three concepts are discussed in more detail below.

SFE: An SFE is defined to include the governments (including agencies and instrumentalities) of China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea; citizens or nationals of any of those countries;[8] entities or branches formed in or having their principal place of business in any of those countries; and controlled entities and subsidiaries of any of the above (determined on a more-than-50 percent equity ownership basis and regardless of jurisdiction of organization).[9] SFE status is generally determined as of the last day of the taxable year.[10]

FIE: An FIE is defined as an entity that meets any of the following tests: (i) an SFE has direct authority to appoint certain officers, (ii) an SFE has at least 25 percent equity ownership or, taken together with other SFEs, at least 40 percent equity ownership, (iii) one or more SFEs has issued at least 15 percent of the entity’s debt, or (iv) the entity made an “effective control” payment to an SFE during the previous year (discussed below). FIE status is determined as of the last day of the taxable year.

Effective Control: An entity makes an “effective control” payment if, during the previous taxable year, the entity made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement that entitles the SFE (or a related party) to exercise “specific authority over key aspects” of the energy generation of the entity’s (or a related person’s) facility that are “not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt” that otherwise would determine FIE status. The OBBBA goes on to provide a broad list of contractual provisions (relating to amount and timing of electricity production, offtake arrangements, access to data, and facility maintenance and repair) that convey impermissible authority to a counterparty. The OBBBA is especially scrutinous of intellectual property licenses (other than qualifying bona fide sales)—for example, any such arrangement (relating to a facility) that is entered into after July 4, 2025 is deemed to convey effective control to the SFE.[11]

Material Assistance: A facility receives “material assistance” from an SFE or FIE if an impermissible amount of the total direct costs of the manufactured products (including components) incorporated into the facility upon completion of construction are mined, produced, or manufactured by an SFE or an FIE. Pending receipt of Treasury guidance contemplated by the Act, taxpayers may rely on certifications from suppliers of manufactured products to determine if those products (or components) were manufactured by an SFE or FIE; new penalties apply to false or inaccurate supplier certifications.[12] Stricter penalties (and an extended statute of limitations) apply to assessments in respect of credits disallowed for “material assistance” violations.

Special rules allow publicly traded entities to rely on publicly reported information to determine their SFE and FIE status.[13]

The SFE ownership, FIE, and “effective control” rules apply to credits claimed for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the “material assistance” rules apply to projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

The “effective control” payment rules are also backed up by a new section 48E ITC recapture rule, effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Under this rule, for the 10 years after a qualifying facility is placed in service, a section 48E ITC is subject to 100-percent recapture (i.e., no vesting) if the taxpayer (i) is allowed a section 48E ITC for any taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 and (ii) makes a payment to an SFE (“with respect to a taxable year”) pursuant to a contract that entitles the SFE (or a related person) to “effective control” over any facility of the taxpayer or a related person.[14] The recapture tax is due in the year the “effective control” payment is made.

The OBBBA did not include a controversial proposed excise tax included in prior versions of the legislation that would have applied to wind and solar facilities (regardless of whether ITCs or PTCs were claimed) that incorporated certain components sourced from prohibited foreign sources.

Domestic Content Clarification

The Act aligns the thresholds for the domestic content bonus credit under the section 48E ITC with the domestic content thresholds under the section 45Y PTC by increasing the section 48E thresholds to match the section 45Y requirements. In an apparent drafting glitch made by Congress in the IRA, the domestic content thresholds were lower under section 48E as compared to the domestic content thresholds under section 45Y.[15] This change is effective for facilities the construction of which begins on or after June 16, 2025.

Depreciation

The Act does not affect the eligibility of solar or wind projects to claim preferential five-year accelerated depreciation.

Battery Storage (Section 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying energy storage projects were eligible for the section 48E ITC, subject to phase-out on the same timeline as wind and solar projects (discussed above).

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA did not change the section 48E ITC eligibility timeline for battery storage projects.

The OBBBA subjects storage projects seeking the section 48E ITC to the Foreign Restrictions applicable to wind and solar projects (discussed above), albeit with stricter “material assistance” provisions.

Fuel Cells (Section 45V and 48E)

Background

Under prior law, fuel cells were eligible for credits under Section 48E only if those cells met the emissions requirements of that section. Because feedstocks for fuel cell projects typically produce GGEs, this often made eligibility for the section 48E ITC challenging.

OBBBA Changes

Qualifying fuel cell projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 are now eligible for a new 30-percent ITC that exempts the projects from the IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and GGE requirements. The new ITC is not eligible for the domestic content and energy community bonuses made available under the IRA.[16]

The Act also moves up the commencement-of-construction deadline for the IRA’s 10-year credit under section 45V for the production of clean hydrogen (a fuel cell feedstock) from January 1, 2033 to January 1, 2028. The Foreign Restrictions do not apply to the clean hydrogen PTC. Our prior alert on the section 45V credit can be found here.

Clean Fuels (Section 45Z)

Background

Before the OBBBA, section 45Z provided a PTC for clean transportation fuel, including a higher credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel. This credit was not available for fuel sold after December 31, 2027

OBBBA Changes

The Act extends the clean fuel production credit by two years, with the result that eligible fuel sold until December 31, 2029 is eligible for this credit.

The Act also relaxes the lifecycle GGE rules for credit-eligible fuel produced after 2025 by excluding the effects of indirect land use changes from the lifecycle GGE calculation.

In an apparent negative reaction to Treasury and IRS guidance released earlier this year, the OBBBA also authorizes the Treasury Secretary to confirm that sales by a taxpayer to an intermediary are permitted if the taxpayer has reason to believe that the fuel ultimately will be sold to an unrelated person.[17]

The Act effectively introduces a new cap on the credit. As background, the credit’s rate is the product of a formula that reduces the credit by reference to a specific fuel’s GGE rate; before the Act, however, fuels with a negative GGE rate could have seen their credit rate increase over the headline statutory rate under the Code’s formula.[18] The Act prospectively limits the fuels for which negative GGE rates that can be taken into account to fuels from specific animal manure feedstocks (e.g., dairy, swine, poultry).

The Act also provides that, for fuel produced after 2025, the credit is available only for fuel derived exclusively from feedstocks produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. The Act also eliminates the enhanced credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Certain of the Foreign Restrictions also apply to clean fuel PTCs. The SFE ownership prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Nuclear (Section 45Y and 48E)

Background

Under current law, qualifying nuclear projects are eligible for PTCs under section 45Y or ITCs under section 48E.

OBBBA Changes

Under the Act, a bonus amount was added to the section 45Y PTC for certain nuclear facilities placed in service in metropolitan statistical areas that have (or, at any time after December 31, 2009, has had) at least 0.17 percent direct employment in nuclear-related sectors.[19] The bonus amount is available for qualifying projects that begin construction in taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The Foreign Restrictions apply to ITCs or PTCs for new nuclear projects on the same timeline as wind and solar projects. For nuclear facilities placed in service before the IRA and claiming the section 45U PTC, the SFE prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration (CCUS) (Section 45Q)

Background

Prior to the OBBBA, section 45Q provided a tax credit of $60 per metric ton for qualified CCUS facilities that captured qualified carbon oxides (QCOs) and either “utilized” (e.g., used in a commercial process) the QCOs or used the QCOs for enhanced oil and gas recovery. Qualified CCUS facilities that stored QCOs in secure geological formations were eligible for a higher credit of $85 per metric ton.[20]

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA increases the section 45Q credit for QCOs that are “utilized” or used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery to equal the credit rate for QCOs that are stored in secure geological formations. The credit rate increase applies to equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025

The SFE ownership prohibition and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) apply to CCUS projects for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Background

The IRA made available a tax credit for the production and sale of certain eligible solar, wind, and energy storage components manufactured in the United States, as well as the production of certain critical minerals. The credits (other than the credits for critical minerals) were subject to a phaseout beginning in 2030.

OBBBA Changes

The Act introduces a new category of credit-eligible critical minerals—metallurgical coal suitable for use in the production of steel, regardless of where produced. The metallurgical coal credit is 2.5 percent of qualifying production costs (as compared to the 10 percent credit for other critical minerals).

The credit for wind components is terminated for components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The Act phases out the credit for critical minerals (other than metallurgical coal) starting in 2031 and terminates the new credit for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029.

The Act also revises the definition of credit-eligible battery module production to require inclusion of all essential equipment necessary for battery functionality.

The Foreign Restrictions are made applicable to section 45X but are generally applied to the production of components (rather the construction of the facility) and are subject to separate “material assistance” thresholds.

These changes are effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The OBBA did not adopt an earlier Senate proposal to prohibit claiming multiple credits (or “stacking”) for the production of components that are integrated into and sold as a single product but did add new requirements to qualify for such stacking. To be eligible for stacking, the components must be produced at the same facility, the end product must be sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65 percent of the direct material costs of the underlying components must be attributable to United States mining, production, or manufacturing. This change is effective for components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Tax Credit Transfers (Section 6418)

Background

The IRA made certain tax credits (including the section 45Y PTC and 48E ITC) transferable for cash on a one-time basis, subject to certain limitations. Please see our prior client alert on the IRA tax credit transfer regime here.

OBBBA Changes

The Act largely leaves intact the tax credit transfer regime introduced by the IRA; for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, however, an SFE cannot buy section 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E credits.[21]

New Classes of Qualified Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Background

Publicly traded partnerships are generally taxed as corporations unless they derive at least 90 percent of their income from certain qualifying sources. Prior to the OBBBA, qualifying sources were limited to passive income and income from certain fossil fuel-related energy or transportation activities.

OBBBA Changes

The Act expands the definition of “qualifying income” to include income derived from qualifying hydrogen storage and transportation; electricity production from qualifying nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal facilities; carbon capture facilities, including electricity production from qualifying facilities with sufficient carbon capture; and thermal energy from hydropower and geothermal facilities.

The amendment is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Ultium Cells LLC, its joint venture, has announced plans to upgrade its Spring Hill, TN plant to produce LFP battery cells.
Strengthening domestic LFP cell production The decision to scale LFP battery cell production in the US is a critical step toward reducing reliance on foreign imports, particularly from China, which currently dominates the global LFP market.
Cost reduction & consumer accessibility One of the most significant advantages of LFP battery cells is their affordability.
This investment underscores the long-term viability of the US EV battery industry and its role in driving local economic development.","The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently released a report highlighting significant shifts in the electric vehicle (EV) battery market, including falling battery prices, the rising adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistries, and China's growing dominance in global manufacturing. In response, General Motors (GM) and LG Energy Solution are making a bold move to strengthen the US EV battery supply chain. Ultium Cells LLC, its joint venture, has announced plans to upgrade its Spring Hill, TN plant to produce LFP battery cells. This decision aligns with global trends while addressing domestic manufacturing needs.

This announcement comes as GM continues to gain momentum in the EV market. The automotive company recently reported a 111% year-over-year increase in EV sales during Q2, delivering 46,280 units. The move to scale LFP production not only allows GM to benefit from the affordability and durability of LFP technology but also strengthens its commitment to innovation, reducing costs, and economic growth.

Strengthening domestic LFP cell production

The decision to scale LFP battery cell production in the US is a critical step toward reducing reliance on foreign imports, particularly from China, which currently dominates the global LFP market. By localizing production in the US, Ultium Cells is addressing a key vulnerability in the EV supply chain while aligning with US government initiatives to bolster domestic manufacturing.

Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability, emphasized the importance of this upgrade: ""At GM, we're innovating battery technology to deliver the best mix of range, performance, and affordability to our EV customers. This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese-rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio.""

The Spring Hill facility will join other Ultium Cells plants, such as the one in Warren, OH, which focuses on nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum (NCMA) chemistries. This diversification ensures that GM can meet a wide range of consumer needs, from high-performance EVs to more affordable options powered by LFP cells.

Cost reduction & consumer accessibility

One of the most significant advantages of LFP battery cells is their affordability. They do not rely on expensive materials like nickel and cobalt, making the battery cells cheaper to produce. This cost efficiency is expected to translate into more affordable EVs, broadening their appeal to a broader range of consumers.

Kelty highlighted this benefit, stating, ""With LFP battery technology, GM is targeting significant battery pack cost savings compared to today's high-nickel battery packs while increasing consumer EV choice."" This focus on affordability is crucial for accelerating EV adoption, particularly among price-sensitive consumers. By offering a range of EVs at different price points, GM aims to make electric mobility accessible to millions of Americans.

Job creation & economic impact

The Spring Hill facility currently employs approximately 1,300 people, and the planned upgrade is expected to sustain and potentially grow this workforce. This investment underscores the long-term viability of the US EV battery industry and its role in driving local economic development.

Kee Eun, president and CEO of Ultium Cells, expressed gratitude for the support received from Tennessee: ""This investment expands our capabilities beyond a single battery cell chemistry, allowing us to produce new chemistries alongside our existing cells. Expanding our product portfolio ensures Ultium Cells will remain at the forefront of battery cell innovation and sustain our commitment to be a stable, long-term employer for the communities we serve."" The upgrade will likely stimulate growth in related sectors, such as raw material processing, battery recycling, and EV infrastructure development, further solidifying the US as a global leader in EV manufacturing.

As GM continues to gain market share in the EV sector, Ultium Cells' investment in LFP battery cell production represents a strategic move to maintain this growth trajectory. By strengthening the domestic supply chain, reducing costs, and creating jobs, this initiative not only supports GM's vision for a sustainable future but also positions the US as a competitive force in the global EV market.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltd5d85e6928931440/68756509c0d7743b25300c4b/The_Ultium_Cells_plant.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-14 19:10:55.515971

“Agriculture is Arkansas’ largest industry, and Arkansas farmers are the backbone of our state’s economy,” said Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
“Major companies like Weyerhaeuser are paying attention and we are grateful for their investment in South Arkansas.” The Monticello/Warren facility will be Weyerhaeuser’s fourth manufacturing facility in Arkansas.
Most recently, LaCroix Precision Optics added new optical assembly capabilities in 2024 to provide a vertically integrated business model to better support customers.
“We are proud to support LaCroix Precision Optics as they grow and continue to make a global impact from Independence County, Arkansas.”","Wayne-Sanderson Farms recently celebrated the grand opening of its $43 million, state-of-the-art feed mill at the company’s Danville Complex in Arkansas. The facility is designed to produce more than 8,500 tons of feed per week, supporting 130 family farm partners throughout the region. The expansion project is the most recent in a lineup of Arkansas companies that are creating jobs and capital investment across the state.

“The opening of our new Danville feed mill represents a major investment in the long-term success of our company and the local farming community,” said Kevin McDaniel, President and CEO of Wayne-Sanderson Farms. “This facility enhances our operational efficiency, supports the family farms at the heart of our supply chain, and reinforces our commitment to sustainable poultry production in Arkansas.”

“We are proud to expand our footprint in Arkansas and excited about the long-term benefits this new feed mill will bring to our employees, farm partners, and the greater River Valley area,” added Toby Tapp, Wayne-Sanderson Farms’ Danville Complex Manager. “This achievement would not have been possible without the ongoing support of the City of Danville, Yell County, the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, and Arkansas Poultry Federation.”

The Danville feed mill is equipped with advanced automation technology to produce nine types of feed formulations tailored to various nutritional needs, ranging from baby chick feed to broiler, pullet and hen formulas. The mill includes two dedicated receiving systems capable of unloading up to 26,500 bushels of soy or corn grain per hour, and operates entirely on truck-delivered ingredients to optimize supply chain efficiency. It also offers expanded storage for feed products and ingredients, along with additional warehouse space for inventory management. In addition to supplying regional poultry farms, the facility will source corn and other grains from local farmers, amplifying its economic impact throughout the surrounding agricultural community.

“Agriculture is Arkansas’ largest industry, and Arkansas farmers are the backbone of our state’s economy,” said Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “It’s investments like these that keep our rural communities strong and ensure that the future of farming in Arkansas remains strong for generations to come. Thank you, Wayne-Sanderson Farms for being such a community staple and for building this important mill.”

“Building a new feed mill is a significant investment, and we are proud that Wayne-Sanderson Farms has chosen Danville, Arkansas as the site for their newest facility,” said Clint O’Neal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission (AEDC). “Wayne-Sanderson Farms has deep roots in Danville, and this feed mill will help both the company and the community as it creates new jobs and drives growth in the poultry sector.

Weyerhaeuser Breaks Ground For $500M Facility In South Arkansas

Last. month, Weyerhaeuser Company broke ground on its new TimberStrand® facility near Monticello and Warren, Arkansas. The company will invest an estimated $500 million in the facility, which is expected to create 200 jobs in the region once fully operational. Weyerhaeuser announced plans for the new facility in November 2024, with the goal of starting operations in 2027.

“We primarily do business in small rural locations all across the U.S. and that dynamic that we have with those local communities is one of the reasons why we’re still in business. Frankly, it’s one of the things that makes this company special, and that couldn’t be more true with our operations here in Arkansas,” said Devin W. Stockfish, Weyerhaeuser president and chief executive officer.

“We’ve been in Arkansas since the mid 1950s. This is a great, great place to do business at the state level,” Stockfish continued. “At the local level, we’ve really just had wonderful engagement across the board all the way from the Governor’s Office, the local community, state legislature, federal. Everyone has really bent over backwards to help us get this facility here. And I can tell you the reason we’re sitting here today in Monticello, Arkansas, and not somewhere else is because of that support and that engagement that we’ve had from our friends in the legislature, the economic development team, the Governor’s office. They’ve all made us feel very welcome. And so we just couldn’t be more excited.”

The facility will produce TimberStrand®, a laminated strand lumber that is engineered for consistent strength and straightness and used in a range of building applications for single- and multi-family wood frame construction. The new facility is expected to add approximately 10 million cubic feet of annual production capacity and help Weyerhaeuser meet growing demand for TimberStrand® and better serve its customers across the U.S. South. Weyerhaeuser plans to source fiber logs from company-owned timberlands in south Arkansas and surrounding regions.

“Arkansas is competing where we know we can win, like in the timber industry, which is why we’ve made big investments in skills-based education, including at the new Forest Research Center at the University of Arkansas – Monticello,” said Gov. Sanders. “Major companies like Weyerhaeuser are paying attention and we are grateful for their investment in South Arkansas.”

The Monticello/Warren facility will be Weyerhaeuser’s fourth manufacturing facility in Arkansas. Weyerhaeuser currently operates a lumber mill in Dierks, a plywood and veneer plant in Emerson, and a seedling nursery in Magnolia. In addition, the company maintains four Timberlands offices in Arkansas, including its main Southern Timberlands office in Hot Springs, and owns or manages 1.2 million acres of timberlands in the state.

Conveyor Technology Invests $33M To Expand In North Little Rock

Electric drum motor dealer and repair company Conveyor Technology is investing $33 million to expand in North Little Rock, Arkansas. This expansion project is expected to create 100 new jobs. The state-of-the-art facility will be the production hub for Conveyor Technology’s proprietary line of drum motors, produced under the Tech-Roll brand name.

“The launch of our new state-of-the-art manufacturing center marks a bold new chapter for Conveyor Technology,” said Justin Carmody, Founder and CEO of Conveyor Technology Inc. “By producing Tech-Roll electric and hydraulic drum motors here in Arkansas, we’re preserving over 20 high-paying jobs, creating a path to more than 100 new ones, and aiming for $54 million in annual revenue. We’re grateful to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission and the Governor’s Office for their support and for helping make this vision a reality.”

Conveyor Technology is currently the only U.S.-based manufacturer of electric drum motors. The company is partnering with FoxDen Capital on the investment project, which will create high-tech manufacturing jobs in Arkansas and reinforce the state’s position as a hub for advanced industry. Conveyor Technology currently has 33 employees.

“Conveyor Technology is an industry leader, and we are proud that the company is continuing to grow in the Natural State,” said AEDC’s O’Neal. “With this latest expansion, Conveyor Technology is contributing to the strength of the U.S. domestic manufacturing sector while also creating new jobs that will have an impact on the lives of many Arkansans.”

LaCroix Precision Optics Expands In Batesville, Creating 107 Jobs

In Batesville, Arkansas, LaCroix Precision Optics will invest $13.8 million to expand its manufacturing operations.The project will create 107 new jobs over five years. The expansion will add new equipment and add 18,750-square-feet of manufacturing space. Construction on the expansion has already begun with operations planned to start in December 2025.

“LaCroix Precision Optics is excited to expand our operations in Batesville, Arkansas to support a multi-year military contract that will help restore a critical supply chain to the United States,” said Kirk Warden, President of LaCroix Precision Optics. “This expansion will allow us to enhance our capabilities with advanced equipment and additional manufacturing space.

The new milestone comes as renewable energy is facing several headwinds.
“As the federal government turns its back on innovation and commonsense, California is making our clean energy future a reality,” Gov.
Battery storage has increased tenfold in the past five years in California, from 1,474 megawatts in 2020 to 15,7763 megawatts now, according to the California Energy Commission.
The state projects it will need 52,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2045, given steadily growing demand from electric vehicles and new data centers needed for artificial intelligence.","California has hit a new record for clean energy.

Solar, wind, hydropower and other carbon-free sources made up 67% of the state’s retail electricity supply in 2023, the most recent year that data is available, according to new statistics released Monday by the California Energy Commission.

The total is an increase from 2022, when it was 61%. And it exceeds the prior record of 64%, set in 2019.

Under a state law signed by former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 aimed at reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change, California is required to reach 100% renewable and carbon-free electricity by 2045.

Solar, wind, geothermal, large hydropower, biomass and nuclear energy are allowed to count under the law.

The new milestone comes as renewable energy is facing several headwinds. Earlier this month, Republicans in Congress passed and President Trump signed a bill that removes and reduces many of the tax breaks, federal grants and other incentives that were put in place by President Biden for states, private companies and homeowners to expand renewable energy and electric vehicles.

“As the federal government turns its back on innovation and commonsense, California is making our clean energy future a reality,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday in a statement. “The world’s fourth-largest economy is running on two-thirds clean power – the largest economy on the planet to achieve this milestone.”

A key part of the state’s ability to keep expanding renewable energy has been fast growth in the construction of battery storage plants over the past five years. The plants capture electricity generated by solar power during hot parts of the day when the sun is shining and then release it back onto the power grid at night after the sun goes down.

But a major fire in January at one of the world’s largest battery storage plants, run by Texas-based Vistra and based in Moss Landing, in northern Monterey County, has raised safety concerns about the technology and given rise to community groups opposing the construction of new plants in their neighborhoods.

Battery storage has increased tenfold in the past five years in California, from 1,474 megawatts in 2020 to 15,7763 megawatts now, according to the California Energy Commission. A megawatt is enough electricity to run 750 homes.

But much more will have to be built. Electricity demand is steadily growing statewide due the growth in electric car sales — 25% of new car sales in California are now electric vehicles, the most of any state — along with the expanded demand from data centers needed for artificial intelligence, among other factors.

The state projects it will need 52,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2045, given steadily growing demand from electric vehicles and new data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

The plant is set to break ground in 2027 and begin commercial operation by 2032 as part of the state's federally backed HyVelocity hydrogen hub.

The start date for the facility, called Project Labrador, has become a critical element following passage of the federal budget reconciliation package and its enactment on July 4. The law amended the sunset clause of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—specifically Section 45V, which created a clean-hydrogen production tax credit of up to $3 per kilogram that could amount to nearly $3 billion over the program’s 10-year span.

The revisions now require these types of cleaner energy projects to begin construction before Jan. 1, 2028, according to the Congressional Record.

In filings to Jefferson County, Texas, Chevron requested a 10-year, 100% property-tax abatement, an incentive package that comparable southeast Texas energy projects suggest could exceed $50 million in foregone local taxes, according to regional analysts and first reported by the Houston Business Journal.

Chevron’s filing indicates that Project Labrador will capture and sequester CO₂ emissions through the company’s Bayou Bend carbon storage initiative, although specific capture rates and storage locales remain undisclosed.

HyVelocity is one of seven regional clean‑hydrogen hubs selected by the U.S. Energy Dept. under the 2021 infrastructure law, with its industry partners including AES Corp., Air Liquide, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Mitsubishi Power Americas and Ørsted to catalyze production and delivery of lower‑carbon hydrogen across the Gulf Coast.

As a founding member, Chevron was set to be able to tap into up to $1.2 billion in federal cooperative-agreement funding for HyVelocity, of which an initial $22 million was disbursed in November 2024 for early engineering and carbon‑capture activities, according to the hub’s website. When it created the hubs, DOE said activities would create up to 45,000 jobs in the Gulf Coast region while sequestering as much as seven million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Austin Knight, vice president of Chevron New Energies for Hydrogen, said in a statement then that partnering and helping to connect value chains are key components to make hydrogen happen at scale.”

President Donald Trump has not voiced strong support for hydrogen hub funding, but DOE had earlier described Project Labrador as a benchmark for large-scale blue hydrogen deployment. Chevron did not respond to an ENR query on the amount of federal money allocated to Project Labrador funding.

It represents ingenuity, resilience and upward mobility. In the San Joaquin Valley, we see those values in motion every day: in companies that are automating processes, reskilling workers and exporting goods that fuel both our local economy and global markets.

Nationally, the manufacturing sector is undergoing a seismic shift. After decades of offshoring and underinvestment, the U.S. is rethinking its industrial future. Tariffs, global supply chain disruptions and new federal investments have created both pressure and opportunity. Reshoring, infrastructure upgrades and clean energy manufacturing have become our reality. The question is: are we prepared?

In the Valley, signs point to yes.

Across the region, industry and education are working more closely than ever. Community colleges are expanding hands-on training. Local high schools are building stronger career technical education pathways. Employers are opening their doors to apprenticeships and internships that offer real-world experience. These efforts are part of a growing, coordinated push to equip our workforce for what’s next.

At the same time, many local manufacturers are adapting in real time. With input costs rising and skilled labor in short supply, companies are embracing technology to stay open. Automation, digital production tools and efficiency upgrades are no longer optional. They’re how smaller manufacturers are staying nimble and growing sustainably in a rapidly changing environment.

This transformation is being fueled by collaboration between employers, educators, economic development leaders and policymakers. That collaboration is critical as we look ahead. Because if this moment is about anything, it’s about the choices we make now to secure a more inclusive, durable economy for the future.

This October, the 10th Annual Valley Made Manufacturing Summit offers a chance to reflect on that progress and push the conversation forward. The event brings together stakeholders from across the region to share insights and align around solutions. This year’s keynote speaker, Oren Cass of American Compass, will offer a timely challenge: What does it take to rebuild American industry in a way that supports working families and strengthens local economies? What we believe is that it must start in places like the Valley.

For the San Joaquin Valley, manufacturing is about ensuring that our economy includes and uplifts the communities that make this region unique.

We have the grit, the vision, and the leadership to shape the next era of manufacturing. To learn more about the San Joaquin Valley Manufacturing Alliance and how you can get involved, visit www.sjvma.org.

in De Soto

TOPEKA – Governor Laura Kelly and Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland along with many federal and state dignitaries today celebrated with Panasonic Energy the grand opening of the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing plant in the United States. Panasonic is investing $4 billion and already has hired approximately 1,000 staff at the De Soto plant.

“Panasonic’s state-of-the-art EV battery plant marks a bright new era in Kansas,” Governor Laura Kelly said. “The monumental effort that has gone into every aspect of this project has culminated in this historic day as the plant begins mass production of EV batteries. It’s hard to overstate what Panasonic’s investment means to Kansas and the value of the partnership that made it possible.”

The De Soto plant is the largest economic development project in company history — and Kansas history. An estimated $2.5 billion in new economic activity in Kansas will be generated annually by the project.

“The opening of our Kansas factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said. “This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas. Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains, and nurturing the next generation of battery talent. This facility represents not only our commitment to the region but also a foundation for long-term collaboration and innovation in the U.S.”

The project is expected to create up to 4,000 new jobs and significantly boost the regional and state economy, supporting an estimated 4,000 additional jobs created by suppliers and community businesses and 16,500 construction jobs, as cited in an independent Wichita State University economic impact study.

“Kansas leaders did the equivalent of kicking down doors and leaping over tall buildings to win this $4 billion investment by Panasonic,” Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland said. “This is a once-in-a-generation move that will power our economy, support thousands of Kansas families and spark opportunity for decades to come. It’s bold. It’s historic. And all Kansans can feel pride today in seeing that our state can do big things again, and that our best days are ahead of us.”

The 300-acre manufacturing plant, which is opening almost three years to the date of the initial announcement, is located in De Soto’s Astra Enterprise Park. The state-of-the-art facility will operate and produce approximately 66 lithium-ion batteries per second. Its infrastructure is broken into two wings, with four battery lines on each wing. At the end of both wings, infrastructure is designed for shipping, packing, and sub-supply vendor spaces for Panasonic partners.

“Panasonic’s new state-of-the-art facility in De Soto is a milestone for our state and a testament to Kansas’ talented workforce and leadership in energy production and innovation,” U.S. Senator Jerry Moran said. “I commend the leadership of Panasonic for choosing the Sunflower State for its U.S. manufacturing site, creating thousands of quality jobs for Kansans and drawing new people to the Midwest. With this investment, we are continuing to make certain Kansas remains a place where the next generation – with their knowledge and talent – can stay and build a future.”

“The grand opening of the Panasonic plant is a huge milestone for De Soto and our entire community. This project shows what’s possible when local, state, and federal leaders work across the aisle to bring opportunity home,” Representative Sharice Davids (KS-03) said. “I’m proud to have helped make this happen — and even prouder of the long-term jobs, innovation, and economic growth it will bring to our community.”",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 22:07:30.491691

By Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh

Changes made in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) to the tax credits (45Q) companies receive for capturing carbon dioxide fit within President Trump’s oft-stated goals of global competitiveness, “drill baby drill,” and penalizing unfriendly nations. Indeed, one of the provisions in the bill could lead to an increase in the amount of oil produced through enhanced recovery, although ultimately, many factors will come into play.

The 45Q tax credit pays companies to capture carbon dioxide from industrial and power sources or using direct air capture (DAC). Historically, companies received higher credit amounts for storing the carbon permanently, as opposed to utilizing the carbon in materials or for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The Biden administration increased the credit amounts for point source capture and DAC in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This was done to incentivize the deployment of both carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and DAC for their climate benefits and achieved early success.

The Trump administration made two notable changes to the tax credit in the OBBBA.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC). As with other tax credits, an FEOC measure was included. However, unlike other credits, the FEOC for 45Q only applies to the entity claiming the tax credit, not to the supply chain or materials associated with the project, making it easier to comply with.

Parity between storage and utilization. This provision equalizes the credit amount for both CCS ($85/ton) and DAC ($180/ton), whether the carbon is stored permanently or used in products or for enhanced oil recovery.

The parity provision strengthens the economic case for both CCS and DAC, as the captured carbon can be used as a value-add for or in products. Captured carbon can be used to carbonate beverages, help cure concrete, or extract more oil from existing oil fields.

The decision to produce oil via EOR is complex and influenced by the quality of current inventories, enabling infrastructure, and the price of oil. Historically, companies needed an oil price of around $75/barrel for EOR to be economically viable. One CCS project, Petra Nova, had to shutter its capture facility after the price of oil dipped below that amount during the COVID-19 pandemic. The revision of 45Q in the OBBBA changes that calculus and may increase the production of oil from EOR in the United States.

EOR accounts for around 2 percent of the overall barrels produced worldwide and around 6 percent in the United States. However, the IEA has projected an increase in EOR production through 2040. The change in tax credit could position the United States to increase EOR market share. That projected EOR increase, coupled with carbon pricing regimes around the world, could raise the value of American EOR, as it can have a lower carbon content compared to standard produced barrels.

The increased credit amount likely means greater deployment of CCS, and potentially DAC. The climate benefits of this will need to be assessed on a project-by-project basis. It is not clear if this administration values the climate benefits of CCS and DAC, but what is clear is its commitment to US oil and gas production.

Low-Emissions Hydrogen

By Anne-Sophie Corbeau

Now that the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has passed, it appears to be less damaging to US progress on low-emissions hydrogen than initially expected, but is still less supportive than the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). On the supply side, support for low-carbon hydrogen remains unchanged, while support for renewable hydrogen is curtailed over time. Meanwhile, domestic demand for low-emissions hydrogen appears weaker, primarily due to uncertainties surrounding H2Hubs funding, potentially forcing the US to turn to highly competitive and limited export markets.

The Biden Administration’s low-emissions hydrogen strategy aimed to scale up clean hydrogen production and use to meet national sectoral decarbonization goals. It received major backing from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the 2022 IRA. The BIL appropriated $9.5 billion in funding for clean hydrogen through the Department of Energy (DOE), including $7 billion for seven hydrogen hubs (H2Hubs) that were selected in October 2023, and $1 billion for demand-side support. The IRA seemed to mark a pivotal moment for the US hydrogen industry: its generous 45V production tax credits (PTC) of up to $3/kilogram based on carbon intensity, an increase upon the existing 45Q (supporting low-carbon hydrogen), and technology-neutral approach instantly made the US appear as one of the world’s most attractive hydrogen markets. As of May 2024, the US had 1.6 Mt of hydrogen projects having reached FID, more than any other country, including China (with 1.4 Mt). However, most of these projects were supported by 45Q. Delays in the Department of the Treasury’s final rules on 45V held back renewable hydrogen projects.

The OBBBA shortens the deadline for 45V PTCs for hydrogen projects by five years. While this still allows time for projects to start construction (by the end of 2027), the administration’s unfavorable stance on wind and solar, coupled with intensifying competition for electricity driven partly by growing demand from data centers, could limit the number of renewable hydrogen projects that move forward. One potential exception is low-carbon hydrogen projects aiming to qualify for 45V based on low methane emissions. Meanwhile, the bill leaves the 45Q deadline of 2032 and $85/ton PTC largely unchanged, continuing support for low-carbon hydrogen.

Given this continued, if curtailed, support for clean hydrogen supply, the bill is unlikely to stop US development in the sector, but it may reinforce the trend toward low-carbon hydrogen projects supported by 45Q. That said, supply projects will need offtakers, and domestic demand for clean hydrogen (especially renewable) has been weak — a situation that is unlikely to change given the new administration’s limited regulatory pressures on reducing emissions, the high cost of renewable hydrogen, and the uncertain outlook for hydrogen hubs (pending the DOE’s review of programs). Hubs rumored to face cuts had planned to use renewable and nuclear power to produce hydrogen, further weakening the outlook for domestic demand for renewable hydrogen. Moreover, a recent DOE audit found that the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations lacked proper planning and resources for the H2Hubs Program, which may lead to a focus on fewer (mostly low-carbon) hubs.

As a result, hydrogen project developers and electrolyzer manufacturers may increasingly turn to export markets — though these remain narrow and highly competitive, with importers scrutinizing the carbon intensity of imported hydrogen and derivatives. Beginning in 2028, US competition in renewable hydrogen exports will fade, opening opportunities for projects in the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa, while in the absence of a domestic market, US electrolyzer manufacturers may lose out in their competition against China.

Critical Minerals

By Dr. Tom Moerenhout

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) represents a mixed bag for US critical minerals development. While the bill ramps up extraction funding, it guts demand and key incentives for processing. This could widen, not close, America’s critical mineral gap with China.

On the one hand, the bill expands federal support for domestic mineral extraction, appropriating $5 billion to the Department of Defense’s Industrial Base Fund for critical mineral supply chain investment, plus $2 billion for strategic stockpiling and $500 million to leverage up to $100 billion in project development loans and guarantees. This represents a meaningful shift from the more piecemeal approach to directly funding critical mineral supply chains of the Biden administration. Combined with recent executive orders on critical minerals, it signals a more interventionist White House willing to prioritize resource security. In that sense, Trump’s approach mirrors historical US strategies on oil: secure extraction to reduce import dependency.

But if end-to-end industrial strength is the goal, the bill also leaves some gaps unaddressed and includes some serious setbacks. Unlike with oil, the US lacks a mature domestic processing and refining base for most key critical minerals. This is also where China dominates, in many cases accounting for over 60 percent of global processing and refining. The bill includes no provisions to address this issue; in fact, it repeals or phases out key measures introduced by the Biden administration that were put in place precisely to spark processing and midstream capacity building.

These measures included the 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit and other clean energy tax credits as well as the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. The former was originally intended to increase demand for electric vehicles coupled with local content requirements that necessitated domestic production of batteries and battery components as well as production of critical minerals in Free Trade Agreement partners. Eliminating it will erode much of the demand pull for critical mineral investments, making it more difficult to finance critical minerals projects. National defense applications are important, but the demand from them is much smaller than that from the clean energy sector.

The 45X credit was meant to incentivize domestic processing of clean energy components, including critical minerals. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the 45X credit for critical minerals did not phase out at all, reflective of the long-term and capital-intensive nature of critical mineral mining and processing. The final 45X rule under the Biden administration also included direct and indirect material costs, which was a significant upgrade to lower competitiveness disadvantages of US processors. The tax credit will now be phased out for critical minerals starting in 2031, which reduces the attractiveness for processors as it takes several years and a great deal of capital to get a processing project up and running. The fact that 45X is a production credit and not an investment credit means that it is far less attractive for financing new processing infrastructure.

The OBBBA will likely go some way toward expanding US critical mineral investment. But a resilient US supply chain requires more than increased extraction; it also needs processing and midstream capacity development, and urgently so. On this latter front, the bill falls short, and may even be a setback.

Electric Vehicles

By Dr. Tom Moerenhout

US electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and competitiveness will be hard hit by President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The bill’s rollback of US EV tax credits may serve Trump’s goals of saving federal dollars in the short term, but it could create significant risks for the United States in the long term. The measures will likely reduce domestic demand for EVs, cede EV market share to foreign competitors (especially China), and jeopardize battery investments and innovation that underpin electric mobility.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) deployed historic subsidies to jumpstart US EV adoption and manufacturing in an effort to enter the United States into a global race largely dominated by China. The IRA’s $7,500 new EV credit (30D), $4,000 used EV credit (25E), 45W commercial EV credit, and 45X production tax credit for batteries spurred domestic sales, manufacturing, and investment, while the IIJA funded nationwide charging infrastructure. These policies helped EVs surpass 8 percent of new US car sales in 2023 and anchored over $110 billion in announced battery and EV supply chain investments.

Trump’s bill takes three big swipes at these IRA policies and EVs.

First, it terminates the 30D and 25E consumer credits, ends the widely used 45W commercial EV credit, and sets a hard sunset for the 45X battery production credit by 2033. Market predictor Rho Motion projects US EV sales to fall by over 40 percent through 2030. This is because 50 percent of EVs sold in the United States received the $7,500 tax credit and because the leasing tax credit meant that about two-thirds of EVs sold recently were for leased EVs. The weakened 45X incentive further blunts US efforts to compete with China’s battery dominance. In a world where battery cost is the primary driver of EV competitiveness, this effectively means that the ever-growing global EV market is ceeded to China.

Second, it undercuts the ability of Tesla and any other company that produces EVs to profit from regulatory credit sales by eliminating federal penalties for automakers that miss fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The new bill doesn’t end the CAFE standards but effectively ends any civil penalties under the Transportation Department’s fuel economy rules for not reaching them. While Tesla is not the only company that produces only EVs, it is by far the largest, and the impact of the changes on its business could prove substantial, as credit sales have been hugely important for Tesla across the world, delivering $595 million of revenue in Q1 2025 alone. With Tesla sales falling in the United States and Europe, this poses a significant risk to the largest Western EV champion with a global scale.

And third, it introduces a new auto loan interest deduction for certain US-assembled vehicles through 2028, limited in terms of amount and household income. The deduction allowance largely benefits the early purchasing of lower-cost domestic gas cars, again increasing the incentive for consumers to switch away from EVs.

In addition to the impact on EVs discussed, the cuts to tax credits could reduce demand for critical minerals and batteries, in turn making financing for such projects more difficult. This could hamper efforts to diversify supplies of the critical minerals that fuel the digital economy and the national security sectors.

Nuclear

By Dr. Matt Bowen and Dr. Ashley Finan

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) preserves key federal support for nuclear, including access to tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Department of Energy’s loan program. It adds resources to accelerate micro-reactor development for military use, though also adds foreign entity provisions for the IRA tax credits, which could constrain their use for new commercial plants depending on implementation.

New nuclear projects remain eligible for the IRA’s two main clean electricity tax credits: the Section 45Y production tax credit (PTC) and the Section 48E investment tax credit (ITC). As with the original IRA text, new nuclear projects must start construction by 2033 to get the full benefit of these credits. As with other technologies, the OBBBA introduces restrictions on eligibility for entities with ties to specified foreign countries. The scope and impact of these restrictions will depend on future regulatory guidance and how the Department of the Treasury defines foreign influence. The bill also adds “nuclear energy communities” to the definition of “energy communities” under Section 45. This change could allow certain projects, including uprates or restarts, to qualify for a 10 percent bonus to the 45Y credit, depending on how eligibility is interpreted.

Support for existing plants is maintained through the 45U credit for zero-emissions electricity, though access has been narrowed. After 2027, projects using nuclear fuel from countries such as Russia or China will no longer qualify, unless the fuel was secured under contracts signed before 2023.

Beyond tax credits, the bill makes structural changes to the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which has been an important source of financing for large-scale energy infrastructure, including nuclear. It eliminates language from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that directed LPO funding to projects that “enable operating energy infrastructure to avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases,” and removes the requirement that new fossil fuel projects include emissions controls. The bill also broadens eligibility to include fossil and critical minerals projects, along with nuclear and other technologies that enhance grid reliability. The bill extends commitment authority for the LPO by two years, from September 30, 2026 to September 30, 2028, and adds $1 billion for the LPO to carry out activities.

Generally, while the bill rescinds funds for LPO commitments to specific renewable energy technologies, the LPO’s ability to support nuclear energy projects remains unchanged. The broadening of the LPO’s authority to support fossil and critical minerals projects could limit the commitment authority available for nuclear energy if many fossil and mineral projects are supported.

In line with its national security emphasis, the bill provides $125 million for “the acceleration of development of small, portable modular nuclear reactors for military use” as outlined in section 20005. The funding could be intended to support existing military micro-reactor projects and to accelerate the implementation of priorities set out in the administration’s May 23, 2025, executive order on advanced nuclear technologies for national security.

Overall, the provisions in the bill relating to nuclear energy leave unchanged existing subsidies for the deployment of new commercial reactors. The new foreign entity provisions that apply to the IRA tax credits may adversely impact the utilization and impact of those credits, but the effects will depend on implementation details. The bill also provides funding to accelerate development of micro-reactors for military use.

Solar and Wind

By Dr. Noah Kaufman

Consistent with the Trump administration’s broader rollback of US climate policies, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) introduces spending cuts targeted at provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that were primarily aimed to address climate risks, including subsidies for solar and wind.

While often grouped together in a single bucket, the clean energy provisions of the IRA differed across important dimensions. The OBBBA largely leaves intact the incentives that support technologies with little current role in the energy mix, such as enhanced geothermal and next generation nuclear energy.[1] Subsidies for promising emerging technologies are relatively inexpensive, and they can be justified by the boost they offer to energy innovation and associated gains to economic productivity, which are broadly shared goals. In contrast, solar and wind energy[2] have become cost competitive over the last decade[3] and are the source of most new electricity capacity in the US. The bill phases out tax credits for solar and wind over roughly two years, though within days of its passage Trump seemingly ordered federal agencies to end them sooner.

The IRA’s solar and wind incentives were key components of President Biden’s climate strategy, which aimed to align federal policy with emissions goals. Rapidly deploying solar and wind offered unrivaled potential for near-term emissions reductions.[4] In addition, Biden’s strategy sought to prepare the US economy for an impending global energy transition by building domestic renewable energy supply chains, currently dominated by China. To that end, the IRA’s tax credits included bonuses for using US-made equipment, complemented by separate incentives to spur domestic clean tech manufacturing.

In contrast, President Trump has eliminated US climate goals and has an energy policy strategy that emphasizes expanding fossil fuel production. The Trump administration argues that subsidies for mature, intermittent technologies like solar and wind distort energy markets and harm grid reliability.

Repealing the solar and wind tax credits effectively transfers funds to the federal treasury that would have been provided to energy developers (and, indirectly, to energy consumers in the form of lower electricity prices). It will also lead to less wind and solar on the US grid, although the precise impacts are uncertain because they depend on how market participants and regulators respond. Some projects will be canceled, while others will rush to meet deadlines or proceed without federal support.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image_Assessing-the-Energy-Impacts-of-the-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Act.png,N,,2025-07-14 16:18:24.371980

Kyle Spencer, Norfolk’s chief resilience officer, said it will look much different than the existing floodwall that the Army Corps built around Nauticus in the 1970s.
In May, city and Army Corps officials told the City Council that the cost and timeline for Resilient Norfolk have both gone up.
The Army Corps’ Norfolk District stated it cannot comment on a new price tag until officials conduct a formal analysis, but they expect it to rise beyond the $2.6 billion Congress approved in 2020.","People passing through the eastern edge of downtown Norfolk will soon see construction for the first phase of the city’s massive floodwall project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The Norfolk Planning Commission recently approved designs for Phase 1A of the more than $2.6 billion project, which the city calls Resilient Norfolk.

The effort aims to protect the city from catastrophic flooding during major storms and is part of the Army Corps’ wider Coastal Storm Risk Management program developed after 2012’s Hurricane Sandy. Virginia Beach and the Peninsula are working on CSRM projects but are still in the study phase.

Norfolk’s project is set to include home elevations, pump stations, surge barriers across several waterways and a nearly 9-mile seawall wrapping around downtown to Lambert’s Point.

The first piece will stretch around the shoreline from the Berkley Bridge east to the Chesterfield Heights neighborhood, including Harbor Park and the future casino.

The wall will range in height from about 6 1/2 feet to about 16 1/2 feet, according to the city.

Kyle Spencer, Norfolk’s chief resilience officer, said it will look much different than the existing floodwall that the Army Corps built around Nauticus in the 1970s.

The old one “is just a big, bare concrete slab sticking out of the ground,” Spencer said. “Ours will look mainly like an elevated walkway, bike path and have some textures and design elements to it that kind of soften it to the eye.”

The Elizabeth River Trail will sit on top of the wall and levee system from the Berkley Bridge to the Amtrak railroad tracks. Spencer said the goal is to install benches and lighting to allow people to take in the river view.

The floodwall will be more visible from the street side along Water Street, he said.

The first phase also includes two new pump stations to help drain heavy rainfall during storms, and a living shoreline along parts of the seawall.

Norfolk plans to start sitework this fall, such as relocating utilities and tearing up pavement. Contractors hired by the Army Corps would then build the actual wall, likely not until 2027.

In May, city and Army Corps officials told the City Council that the cost and timeline for Resilient Norfolk have both gone up. The new estimated end date for all parts of the project is 2037, five years later than the original timeline.

The federal government is responsible for paying 65% of the cost, with the city on the hook for the rest, or more than $930 million.

The Army Corps’ Norfolk District stated it cannot comment on a new price tag until officials conduct a formal analysis, but they expect it to rise beyond the $2.6 billion Congress approved in 2020.

Today, Earthjustice, on behalf of Ironbound Community Corporation (ICC), sued the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission (PVSC) for approving a fourth gas power plant in Newark, despite strong community opposition. The plant would be built next to the Ironbound neighborhood, which is already crowded with smokestacks, diesel trucks, and power plants.

The facility would sit in one of the most polluted ZIP codes in New Jersey, where residents face higher rates of asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and shortened life spans. In just four square miles, over 50,000 people, most of them working-class people of color, live breathing the air pollution from three existing gas plants, the state’s largest trash incinerator, and nonstop diesel truck traffic from one of the largest ports in the country, along with sprawling warehouses.

“Our community has said no, again and again, but PVSC continues to put our health at risk with a project we didn’t ask for and don’t need,” said Hazel Applewhite, CEO of Ironbound Community Corporation. “We’re fighting to protect our families, our elders, and especially our children, so they can grow up breathing clean air and living full, healthy lives. Newark residents are not disposable. This lawsuit is about safeguarding our community today and for generations to come. We will not be ignored.”

PVSC claims the plant is needed to prevent power loss. But the electric utility spent $4.8 billion on grid hardening, including elevating the substation that serves PVSC’s wastewater treatment plant. Thanks to these investments, the facility has not lost power in years. Still, PVSC wants to spend some $280 million more on a polluting fossil-fuel plant the community doesn’t need. Even FEMA warns that gas is unreliable during storms and shouldn’t be used for emergency power.

“Ironbound residents have been clear. They deserve clean air, and PVSC has safer, cleaner options,” said Colin Parts, Earthjustice associate attorney. “PVSC’s decision to push forward with this polluting, unnecessary gas plant is arbitrary, unjustified, and will only exacerbate the harms Ironbound residents already face.”

Furthermore, some billions of investments in clean energy infrastructure are at risk of delays or outright cancellation, and greenhouse emissions are expected to rise.

As much as half to two-thirds of the cost increases for households are expected to be driven by increased spending on fuel, including gas, diesel, and electricity for EVs, according to the report.

Rhodium anticipates fewer EVs on the road due to earlier termination of EV tax credits, and a subsequent rise in gas consumption of as much as 11 percent. Increased gas use is projected to drive up gas prices by as much as 3 percent in 2035. The report attributes as much as one quarter to half of the rise in household energy spending to rising electricity rates, which are expected to jump 2 to 4 percent in 2035.

Just outside Nashville, American ingenuity and innovation are thriving in the rolling hills of Spring Hill, Tennessee. Ultium Cells – General Motors’ joint venture with LG Energy Solution – is demonstrating America’s ability to lead in transformative new battery cell technology. With the Ultium Cells sites in Spring Hill and Warren, Ohio, GM has the largest OEM battery cell manufacturing capacity in this country.

Building on a $2.3 billion commitment announced in 2021, Ultium Cells Spring Hill will guide the next phase of our battery strategy, capable of producing multiple chemistries.

In addition to today’s nickel cobalt manganese aluminum (NCMA) pouch cells, the Ultium Cells plant will produce battery cells using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. LFP was an American breakthrough that’s grown in popularity as a low-cost battery solution worldwide. I’m proud that we’re bringing its benefits – and associated jobs – back to America. Work on the LFP battery cell lines at Spring Hill will start soon, with full commercial production targeted for late 2027.

With Spring Hill established as the home for LFP, the next step will be finalizing a home for lithium manganese rich (LMR) chemistry. As we recently announced, GM plans to be the first company to produce LMR prismatic battery cells at commercial scale. This advancement is key to delivering the best mix of range, performance, and affordability for our EV customers.

Our expertise in these three battery chemistries will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LMR and LFP cell technologies so we can produce both full-size electric pickups and affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Bolt. The new battery chemistries will complement our NMCA solutions and expand the range of choices available across our growing EV portfolio.

Meanwhile, in Michigan

On a cool day last month in Warren, Michigan, the final steel beam was placed at the newly named Ancker-Johnson Battery Cell Development Center on our nearly 70-year-old Global Technical Center campus outside Detroit. Between this 500,000-square-foot building complex and the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center next door, we’ve invested $900 million to strengthen our U.S. technology base and secure a competitive advantage in the global race for battery leadership. Our commitment to modern facilities and cutting-edge equipment far exceeds the investment of any U.S. automaker.

CAPTION: The final steel beam of the Ancker-Johnson Battery Cell Development Center in GM's campus in Warren, Michigan, was signed by the facility and construction teams before being raised into its home in June.

The Ancker-Johnson Center, named for pioneering physicist and former GM executive Betsey Ancker-Johnson, will help reduce development times for new batteries by as much as a year.

Its first assignment? To advance LMR batteries into production before anyone else.

Workhorse Group just unveiled plans to merge with a private US electric commercial vehicle company – and lined up fresh financing, debt restructuring, and a sharp 40% drop in its share price.

What does this mean?

Workhorse Group announced on July 14, 2025, that it's in merger talks with a private US electric vehicle maker, planning to form a new subsidiary and distribute newly minted Workhorse shares to seal the deal. The agreement calls for refinancing current convertible notes, canceling certain warrants, and building a fresh financial lifeline. Part of the package: nearly $20 million from a sale-leaseback of Workhorse’s Indiana facility, funded by affiliates tied to the private firm’s top shareholder. Once wrapped up, the deal would let Workhorse wipe about $33 million in debt off its books and issue three million new shares. But that didn’t soothe investor nerves – shares tumbled over 39% to $2.69 on the news.

Why should I care?

For markets: Shareholders brace for impact as dilution fears rise.

This deal showcases the uphill battle electric vehicle startups face, especially as they scramble to secure funding and strategic partners. The swift stock drop reflects investor anxiety over share dilution and the company’s future prospects, highlighting skepticism that more shares and heavy restructuring could weigh down possible gains. The trend isn’t new for the EV sector: challenging conditions and high-stakes deals have put plenty of pressure on smaller players looking to survive.

The bigger picture: Industry shake-ups drive a new era in electric vehicles.

Consolidation is heating up among electric commercial vehicle makers, with scale and access to capital now crucial for survival. Established automakers and ongoing supply chain struggles keep the pressure up, so smaller firms are getting shoved toward mergers or risk fading out. These kinds of tie-ups could reshape the competitive order, rewarding companies that raise funds efficiently, control costs, and keep investors on their side as the sector evolves.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3411361_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=8866056489741cdcaac3122ada76862d,N,,2025-07-14 16:21:19.839560

As the planet logs some of its warmest years on record, Maryland is trying to make good on some of the most ambitious climate goals in the country. But the state is struggling to keep up with deadlines it set for itself.

Maryland is halfway to its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions — the primary driver of climate change — by 60% by 2031, though progress has been at a standstill since 2020. The state has another, more ambitious goal on the horizon: net zero emissions by 2045.

Transitioning to renewable energy is another goal, as Maryland aims for half of its electricity to come from renewables by 2030. That includes a significant chunk from solar energy, though experts say reaching these goals is proving difficult.

Federal opposition to state climate action poses a problem, too. In an April executive order, President Donald Trump directed his administration to halt the enforcement of state climate laws, calling them a threat to national security, the economy and “American energy dominance.”

Adding it all up, environmentalists see Maryland’s climate ambitions as laudable — but threatened.

“Maryland is not on track right now for either its renewable energy goals or for its climate goals,” said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Sierra Club. “That doesn’t mean that it can’t be on track, though, because there are a lot of positive programs that will help improve people’s lives and reduce pollution and help with the climate.”

Reducing emissions

Maryland’s plans for emissions reductions are among the nation’s most ambitious — but the state is struggling to keep up with its ambitions.

A 2022 state law says by 2031, Maryland must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% compared to 2006. By 2045, it must produce net zero emissions of the gases that cause global warming.

Getting to a 60% reduction by 2031 would require programs to cut emissions of carbon dioxide — the main driver of climate change across Maryland’s economy — and cost $1 billion a year, according to the state’s Climate Pollution Reduction Plan.

Maryland reduced its emissions 30% by 2020, halfway to the 2031 goal, according to the state Department of the Environment’s greenhouse gas inventory.

But the state hasn’t made progress since then. Though emissions vary across economic sectors, state officials are expecting to see a slight increase in statewide emissions from 2020 to 2023. This is because transportation emissions — the largest category — have increased 6% since the end of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, as emissions from electricity have dropped 10%, according to preliminary state data.

Meanwhile, the state hasn’t found a source for the $1 billion annual investment needed to reach its emissions goals.

“We don’t have cash coming in the door,” said Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters. “So that will slow down the implementation and meeting those reduction goals, no doubt about it.”

On top of that, the state just passed legislation to speed up permitting for new natural gas power plants amid concerns about high energy prices. That could worsen greenhouse gas emissions, though natural gas-fired power plants are cleaner than coal or oil plants.

Coble said she believes the state remains committed to its goals, but she’s pessimistic about meeting them on time because of money issues — including the Trump administration’s impact on climate funding.

The federal administration has made cuts to state climate grants and dismissed climate researchers. It’s also started rolling back environmental regulations as it tries to reinvigorate the country’s fossil fuel industries.

“Under the [Joe] Biden administration, they had billions of dollars going toward it, and I would have been far more optimistic,” Coble said. “But that money is in jeopardy, and those of us working in this field … don’t even know if it’s going to get deployed and how, or what that looks like.”

Renewable energy

Maryland has been moving toward renewable energy for decades, but as of right now, it’s not on track to hit the goals set by the General Assembly six years ago.

Half of Maryland’s electricity consumption is supposed to come from renewable sources by 2030, according to a 2019 law. Within that half, 14.5% of consumption must come from solar power.

But the state is falling behind.

“At this rate, we won’t meet the 14.5% [solar] carveout by 2030,” said Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration.

At a briefing earlier this year, he introduced a report published by the Maryland Energy Administration, which concluded renewables in Maryland and the surrounding region aren’t growing fast enough to keep up with state goals.

Experts also point to issues with the state’s system of incentivizing renewable energy. Electricity suppliers can either provide renewable energy by buying “credits” or pay a fine that goes to a state fund for clean energy grants.

But in 2023, the latest year for which the state has data, renewable energy credits met less than half of the state’s goal and fines made up the rest. That’s a big drop from previous years, and the state said it happened because it was less expensive in 2023 for electric utilities to pay the fine than to pay for renewables.

A 2024 executive order from Gov. Wes Moore set another goal: 100% clean, in-state energy by 2035. The order told the Maryland Energy Administration to create a plan to get there.

Reaching that goal by 2035 is “extremely, extremely unlikely,” Pinsky said at the briefing.

Maryland is struggling to build renewable energy within state borders for several reasons.

It can be expensive and difficult to build large-scale facilities like solar farms in Maryland, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition’s advocacy arm, MAREC Action. Land constraints, high land prices and a crowded transmission grid complicate such efforts, he said.

A backup in project approvals on the regional electricity grid has also caused difficulties.

“While the state certainly does have a strong and growing renewable energy supply today, it does have some unique challenges,” Vaughan said. “You find … common trends across a lot of the smaller, land-constrained states on the East Coast in particular.”

Another law sets a goal of 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2031, equal to over half of Maryland’s total energy sales in 2023.

However, that buildout is in peril. The Trump administration paused leasing and permitting for new offshore projects earlier this year. On top of that, Rep. Andy Harris, State Sen. Mary Beth Carozza and Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan have asked the secretary of the interior to halt a federally approved project off Maryland’s Atlantic coast. There has not yet been a formal response from the Trump administration.

Without new leases for offshore wind, the state won’t be able to achieve its goal, according to the Maryland Public Service Commission. The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” passed in July, will end tax breaks for renewable energy projects such as wind and solar.

Adding it all up, advocates and experts agree Maryland is not where it needs to be.

“You keep on hearing people say, ‘Maryland is a leader in clean energy,’” said Adam Dubitsky, consulting state director of the Maryland Land & Liberty Coalition, a conservative clean energy advocacy group. “And it is simply not true.”

In the General Assembly

While some advocates wanted more of a focus on climate or clean energy during this year’s state legislative session, they celebrated the wins that came their way.

Though advocates are still wary about the push to expedite natural gas, they supported other provisions of the final package such as battery storage procurement — which would store energy generated by wind, solar and fossil fuels — and rate reform. The package would also stop trash incineration from receiving renewable energy subsidies and includes new solar siting standards.

Moving forward, “we just have to figure out how we can responsibly deploy as many renewables and as much [energy] storage as possible,” said State Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, a Democrat from Montgomery County.

Supporters praised the new solar standards as a way to streamline projects and overcome restrictive county rules, but the standards drew backlash from Eastern Shore Republicans. They asked Moore to veto the bill, saying it could upend agriculture in their districts, but the governor signed it into law.

The package also moved Maryland toward new nuclear energy, which doesn’t produce carbon emissions. Environmental advocates are split on whether nuclear is a boon or a danger, but many lawmakers hailed new nuclear tech as a viable long-term option for clean, reliable energy. Nuclear power already makes up 40% of the electricity generated in Maryland.

“There appears to be an acknowledgement by the majority party and the leadership that we need to incorporate nuclear and natural gas in order to achieve the energy demands that we have in our state, which is a big deal,” said State Del. Jesse Pippy, a Republican from Frederick County who serves as minority whip.

Moore vetoed one of the three bills in the package, which would have set up a new energy planning office. Moore cited costs and overlap with other state agencies as reasons for the veto. The office would have focused on reliability and affordability alongside clean energy goals, and the bill drew praise from both sides of the aisle.

“It’s something that I believe we should have done from the very beginning, before we moved forward with all of our climate change legislation a few years back,” said Carozza, a Republican who represents Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties.

The governor also vetoed one study of the costs of greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland and one on data center impacts, frustrating environmental advocates.

Carozza said she believes the state should have known more about the cost of different energy sources, including wind, before enacting its climate goals.

“There now is a recognition at the state level that you cannot just depend on renewable energy to meet Maryland’s energy needs or Maryland’s climate change goals,” Carozza said.

Incremental progress

So, in light of the state’s progress and aggressive goals, can Maryland meet its climate and energy goals on time?

“I am not sure,” said State Sen. Malcolm Augustine, a Democrat from Prince George’s County who serves as president pro tem of the Senate and chair of an energy subcommittee. “But what I do know is that we’re going to work hard to try to achieve that.”

The energy package the General Assembly passed this year moves the state in the right direction, he said. It doesn’t mean the state is backing off its goals but finding a “more achievable route.”

The goals remain state law and Maryland still takes climate change seriously, said State Sen. Brian Feldman, a Democrat from Montgomery County and chair of the Education, Energy and the Environment Committee. He was a lead sponsor of this year’s solar siting bill and sponsored the 2019 law that boosted Maryland’s renewable energy goal to 50% by 2030.

But some advocates felt there wasn’t enough of an emphasis on climate action during the spring legislative session.

“Climate didn’t stay in the conversation the way it should have,” said Tulkin, the Maryland Sierra Club director.

The future is still cloudy for state climate action, though, thanks to the Trump administration’s slew of changes to federal climate and energy policy. Among a host of other actions from the administration, a Trump executive order directs the U.S. attorney general to identify and stop state laws addressing climate change, emissions or environmental justice issues.

Pinsky wrote in response that the move was “worse than irresponsible” and disruptive, accusing the administration of interfering with state matters during a global crisis.

Even so, other climate advocates note Maryland is moving in the right direction despite the challenges it faces.

“What we need to do is just keep taking steps forward,” Coble said. “We just keep chipping away at it, and if we continue to take two to three steps forward every year, it is a whole lot better than doing nothing, that’s for sure.”",https://marylandreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DownsizedDansMountainWind2.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 16:18:50.440545

Major companies, such as Meta and Microsoft, have looked to alternative forms of energy to power their data centers, focusing on nuclear energy.","The rise of commercially available AI systems has led to alarming headlines: each time ChatGPT writes an email, it’s like dumping out a bottle of water, or every prompt answered by a chatbot is equivalent to powering a light bulb for about 20 minutes.

As the technology becomes more integrated into our daily lives, researchers are attempting to quantify AI’s impact on the environment. While concerns over AI’s energy demand and its increasing ubiquity grow, successful efforts among policymakers to track or regulate the industry’s footprint have not. That is largely due to the lack of relevant data and reporting mechanisms from companies in the tech and energy sectors.

What are AI energy costs? And where do they come from?

The environmental similes used in news articles highlight just one aspect of AI’s energy demands. The technology’s ecological impact spans the months and sometimes years that it can take to train and deploy an AI model. Different stages of development rely on specialized hardware with varying, but rather large, consumption needs.

During the training stage, models are fed curated—though often extensive—amounts of data to “learn” based on their algorithms. The electronic chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), used during this process often run 24 hours a day, leading to high energy demands (usually supported by non-renewable sources) that increase quickly depending on the complexity of the model.

For example, researchers from Google and UC Berkeley estimated that training OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 model consumed enough electricity to power around 120 U.S. homes for one year. While a lack of access to this kind of data has made calculating the electricity demands of GPT-4 more difficult, researchers estimate that it likely took 50 times more electricity.

One estimate using data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggested that ChatGPT uses nearly 10 times more electricity than a normal Google search. These numbers will only grow as more users embrace generative AI programs instead of traditional search engines. In fact, researchers estimate that if Google processed 9 billion AI-powered searches per day, they could require 23-30 times the amount of energy needed for normal searches.

Some experts, such as Sasha Luccioni, the AI and Climate Lead at Hugging Face, are maintaining an “AI Energy Score” dashboard, reporting an approximately 62,000 times difference between the highest and lowest energy needs across the dashboard’s different use cases and models. Energy demands for generating text, images, and videos also vary widely, with video generation being the most energy-intensive; the MIT Technology Review￼ recently found that an AI model used about 3.4 million joules, the amount of energy to run a microwave for over an hour, to generate a 5-second video.

Much of the processing of these commands comes through data centers. Data center electricity consumption was 4.4% of U.S. electricity demand in 2023, and could grow to 6% by 2026. Globally, these centers account for 1-2% of the world’s energy needs, but given the rising demands of AI, some expect this could reach 21% by 2030.

This doesn’t account for the use of water, which is needed to cool hardware. Some U.K. researchers estimate the global use of water for data processing could reach half of the country’s water usage by 2027.

Additional indirect energy costs are incurred by maintaining large building infrastructures themselves, including computing hardware, storage systems, and network equipment.

There are also end-of-life costs. A GPU is typically used for four years before being discarded or repurposed. Currently, there is a lack of information on how these devices are disposed of and what the environmental impact of this waste accumulation will be.

Lack of data makes AI energy consumption less transparent

These estimates are further complicated by the fact that tech and electric companies don’t typically release energy or water consumption data and are not subject to obligations to disclose them.

Most estimates are uncertain because they lack proprietary information. While Google, Microsoft, and Meta declined to share AI prompt energy needs of their models, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently wrote that an average query uses 0.34 watt-hours, or how much a lightbulb uses in a couple of minutes, and 0.000085 gallons of water. These figures, however, do not include the extensive energy needs of training the model and only reflect energy needs on a per-query basis.

Growing efficiencies in AI energy consumption

This level of consumption is not lost on those leading the charge. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman conceded that AI will consume more power than might be expected.

Although there has been some growth in efficiency, these improvements have recently plateaued. Larger data centers present an opportunity for greater energy efficiency, as exemplified by the construction of “hyperscale” centers. Other examples include improvements at the hardware level, such as power capping, or limiting the amount of power that’s fed to processors and GPUs; this technique has been shown to decrease energy consumption by up to 15% with minimal effects on the user’s experience.

Other efficiencies are also resulting from the building of smaller models, pruning or quantization of algorithm architecture design, switching to renewable energy sources, increasing collaboration amongst AI firms, or using AI to identify possible improvements for itself and other models. For example, Google DeepMind said it succeeded in reducing its energy consumption in data centers by 30% by using AI to better predict cooling needs.

However, these improvements still require additional use of AI and therefore greater energy consumption, even with new efficiencies accounted for. With lower energy costs for AI systems, increased demand may lead to a rebound effect, where more efficient technology and its lower production costs generate greater demand and adoption, again resulting in increased consumption. This cycle is sometimes referred to as Jevons paradox, a term initially coined when the steam engine became more efficient.

Unfortunately, the impact of increasing energy demands will not be felt equally. Some regions and states are already being drained of resources far more than others. Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” offers one example; it hosts over 300 data centers, the largest number in the United States. Residents are fighting back against the continuous expansions of data centers in the region, leading to rising energy bills, increasing water demand, and worsening air quality due to the facilities’ back-up diesel generators.

Further south, the NAACP recently sued Elon Musk’s xAI for allegedly operating turbines for a South Memphis data center without appropriate permits. The NAACP emphasized that toxic emissions from the turbines were directed toward predominantly Black neighborhoods that bear the brunt of environmental racism.

What will power AI in the future?

To ensure that increasing AI adoption does not exacerbate environmental degradation, policymakers, companies, and communities will need a better understanding of where to focus their attention and resources, starting with better data on emissions and energy consumption.

MIT scientists found that companies using independent auditors for assurance decreased their total emissions by 7.5% annually, even when starting with higher emissions than companies without assurance. However, estimates might not be detailed enough. For example, the IEA estimate includes activity across data centers, without a direct focus on AI applications. Unless tech companies reveal what percentage of their energy use is related to AI, the ambiguity will persist.

Last year, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the “Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024” to better measure the impact of AI. The legislation would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a comprehensive study about the issue, in addition to convening a consortium of stakeholders through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and creating a voluntary reporting system. This would culminate in an interagency report submitted to Congress to report findings and provide policy recommendations.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) also published a report on generative AI’s environmental and human effects in April 2025, outlining six possible policy options, including encouraging developers to share model details about the infrastructure used for generative AI’s training and usage, as well as providing government incentives for more resource-efficient models and training methods.

At the state level, at least 60 bills have been introduced across the country to address the impact of data centers, but there has been little meaningful change. Harvard researchers found that the carbon intensity of data centers was 48% higher than the nationwide average, partly because data centers are often built in areas with dirtier electrical grids.

Major companies, such as Meta and Microsoft, have looked to alternative forms of energy to power their data centers, focusing on nuclear energy. However, the MIT Technology Review emphasized that nuclear power makes up only 20% of electricity production in the U.S., while clean but intermittent technologies, such as wind and solar, cannot fully power always-on data centers.

Given the many unknowns, the time is right for the U.S. to support further research initiatives into methods to lower AI’s environmental impact, while continuing to improve transparency and set standards in this important area. Failure to do so could not only accelerate the climate crisis, but also slow the adoption of AI applications and delay their benefits.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-03-19T103847Z_1081787533_RC2XEDAT64AK_RTRMADP_3_USA-POWER-DATA-CENTERS-1.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-07-14 17:17:59.076615

Now, a newly passed federal spending bill has pulled the plug. President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” ends EV and plug-in hybrid tax credits on September 30, 2025. That leaves consumers a tight summer window to cash in on savings​ up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used models​ before Washington slams the vault shut.

And make no mistake: this is no temporary pause. It’s one of the most aggressive federal walk-backs on electrification policy to date. If you’re shopping for an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, the clock’s ticking​ and so is your potential to save thousands.

How does it compare to rivals?

The biggest rival right now isn’t another car​ it’s time. Only around 20 models qualify for full federal incentives, due to complicated rules around domestic manufacturing, battery sourcing, and price caps under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, and Tesla Model 3, Y, and Cybertruck still make the cut. Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 sneak in via leasing, thanks to a quirk in the legislation that awards credits to the leasing company rather than the buyer.

This leasing loophole has become the industry’s clever workaround. Many models that don’t qualify for tax credits under direct purchase​ such as foreign-built EVs​ can still benefit from credits if leased. The catch? It’s up to the leasing company to pass those savings along, and not all do. So shoppers should ask pointedly before signing anything with an “APR” on it.

Who is this for​ and who should skip it?

If you’ve been on the EV fence, this summer may be your best shot to leap off it. New electric vehicles remain expensive​ the average EV sells for about $63,000, a solid $13,000 more than a comparable gas-powered model. Tax credits helped narrow that gap for many buyers. Come October, they’ll be gone, leaving price-conscious shoppers to either pay full freight or wait for automakers to lower MSRPs voluntarily.

Shoppers looking at “affordable” EVs should be especially aware. The Chevy Equinox EV, touted as a sub-$30K electric crossover after incentives, could see its effective price jump by several thousand dollars this fall. And Slate Auto​ , a startup promising a $19,900 EV​ , recently updated its pricing to “mid-twenties.” Surprise, surprise. The base model budget EV is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

On the flip side, buyers who prioritize performance, luxury, or tech over price may shrug. For them, EV adoption isn’t just about cost​ it’s about experience. But don’t expect those tax credits to return soon. The political winds have shifted, and Washington’s wallet is staying closed.

What's being done about rising power demand?","Rising demand for electrical power in the U.S. has been prompting data centers to generate unprecedented amounts of electricity, with the latest estimates for the coming months skyrocketing with recent trends.

What's happening?

While prior forecasts anticipated about a 2% rise in commercial demand and a 1% rise in overall power consumption for the upcoming year, the Energy Information Administration's June report places those same metrics at 5% and 2%, respectively. According to Bloomberg News, the drastic increase in projected power usage rates can be attributed to a sudden expansion in data centers over the past month.

According to EE Power, ""This sharp upward revision is largely attributed to the expansion of data centers, particularly in areas served by the ERCOT (Texas) and PJM Interconnection (Mid-Atlantic) independent system operators.""

As the EIA's June report noted: ""Data center computing is significantly more energy intensive than computing in general. By 2050, as much as 7% of all U.S. commercial floorspace requires additional energy to meet data center demand across most building types.""

Why is rising power demand important?

Data centers require massive amounts of energy if they're to continue expanding in order to maintain our current digital needs as well as support in-progress technologies like crypto mining and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the pressures placed on power companies as a result can prove taxing both for the environment and for your wallet, since utility costs are sure to rise under duress.

Meanwhile, most conventional power plants rely on the combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity — a process that releases millions of metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution into the atmosphere. The power sector accounts for about one-third of the U.S.'s total carbon pollution, per the Congressional Budget Office, making its climate burden quite significant.

The effects of carbon pollution reverberate far and deep, working to the detriment of our weather, our food, our public health, and more.

What's being done about rising power demand?

Finding alternative means to generate power that don't depend on dirty fuels is key to mitigating the carbon problem in the electricity sector and cutting down your electricity costs. Researchers are still working on innovative new solutions — such as various forms of nuclear power — in order to diversify our clean energy possibilities, but in the short term, solar and wind are the most accessible.

You can even take advantage of solar energy from the comfort of your home by installing solar panels, bringing your monthly utility bills, as well as your power-based carbon emissions, down to near zero.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rising-power-demandimage-reczKM6A6ej6F6ygw-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 16:18:59.764674

Panasonic is investing $4 billion and already has hired approximately 1,000 staff at the De Soto plant.

“Panasonic’s state-of-the-art EV battery plant marks a bright new era in Kansas,” Governor Laura Kelly said. “The monumental effort that has gone into every aspect of this project has culminated in this historic day as the plant begins mass production of EV batteries. It’s hard to overstate what Panasonic’s investment means to Kansas and the value of the partnership that made it possible.”

The De Soto plant is the largest economic development project in company history — and Kansas history. An estimated $2.5 billion in new economic activity in Kansas will be generated annually by the project.

“The opening of our Kansas factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said. “This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas. Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains, and nurturing the next generation of battery talent. This facility represents not only our commitment to the region but also a foundation for long-term collaboration and innovation in the U.S.”

The project is expected to create up to 4,000 new jobs and significantly boost the regional and state economy, supporting an estimated 4,000 additional jobs created by suppliers and community businesses and 16,500 construction jobs, as cited in an independent Wichita State University economic impact study.

“Kansas leaders did the equivalent of kicking down doors and leaping over tall buildings to win this $4 billion investment by Panasonic,” Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland said. “This is a once-in-a-generation move that will power our economy, support thousands of Kansas families and spark opportunity for decades to come. It’s bold. It’s historic. And all Kansans can feel pride today in seeing that our state can do big things again, and that our best days are ahead of us.”

The 300-acre manufacturing plant, which is opening almost three years to the date of the initial announcement, is located in De Soto’s Astra Enterprise Park. The state-of-the-art facility will operate and produce approximately 66 lithium-ion batteries per second. Its infrastructure is broken into two wings, with four battery lines on each wing. At the end of both wings, infrastructure is designed for shipping, packing, and sub-supply vendor spaces for Panasonic partners.

“Panasonic’s new state-of-the-art facility in De Soto is a milestone for our state and a testament to Kansas’ talented workforce and leadership in energy production and innovation,” U.S. Senator Jerry Moran said. “I commend the leadership of Panasonic for choosing the Sunflower State for its U.S. manufacturing site, creating thousands of quality jobs for Kansans and drawing new people to the Midwest. With this investment, we are continuing to make certain Kansas remains a place where the next generation – with their knowledge and talent – can stay and build a future.”",https://thisistopeka.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1200px-Kansas_State_Capitol_in_Topeka_44441302334.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 16:18:20.452328

At every sector, solar installations are expected to take a hit. From utility-scale projects to community solar, energy storage, residential solar and the businesses that support and supply these projects, the untimely end of tax credits is a headwind to navigate.

Tax credit eligibility is also denied to projects that exceed thresholds of components or investment from foreign entities of concern (FEOC), placing further pressure on both project developers and manufacturers.

The policy outcome causes pain for clean energy investors and the communities that created jobs or expected more job creation, particularly in Republican districts. Since the tax credits were enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, over 224 projects totaling nearly $110 billion in investment and leading to over 83,000 jobs were announced in Republican voting districts, according to E2. This was roughly 80% of the expected economic boom onset by the Biden-era industrial policy. Even before the bill was passed, the looming threat of cuts led to billions in project and factory cancellations, with more likely to come.

Despite the stranded investment, Lazard analysis found that solar levelized cost of electricity beats the lowest-cost fossil fuel for new-build projects, even without tax credits. Solar represented 77.7% of new capacity added to the grid thus far in 2025, and with electricity demand expected to rise, the fundamentals for solar are still strong.

pv magazine USA published a list of industry reactions from leading trade organizations shortly after the bill passed. Below are reactions from solar industry businesses and organizations directly supporting those businesses.

Emily Walker, director of insights, EnergySage

“This bill doesn’t just eliminate clean energy tax credits prematurely—it will kill thousands of jobs, crush small businesses, and make home energy more expensive for millions of Americans. Clean energy is the only viable energy future—one that is sustainable, affordable, and provides the abundance of energy the world needs… In the short term, we will help as many American homeowners as possible go solar before the tax credits expire at the end of this year. Beyond that, we will serve the millions of homeowners for whom solar remains a smart investment and an important act of independence from rising utility rates.”

Richard Lu, chief executive officer, SolarBank

“SolarBank is prepared. We have enough advanced-stage projects we can get into construction before the deadline to take advantage of the tax credits. March 2025 marked the 19th consecutive month that solar was the largest source of new electrical capacity in the U.S. As costs continue to fall, and with superior speed to market, in my view there remains a bright future for solar and battery storage projects.”

Rodolfo Bitar, vice president of business development PV Hardware USA

“PVH USA remains committed to the U.S. solar energy market, which has demonstrated its resilience in the past and remains a vital and growing part of the country’s energy sector. The decision to locate PVH USA’s factory in Houston was no accident. The city and region have historically been an energy hub for progress in the country, and that is still the case today. Similarly, our dedication to serving the U.S. solar market is unchanged and is as strong as it was the day we opened our factory more than one year ago.”

Brett Henderson, chief executive officer, Solar Panel Recycling

“This isn’t the first setback the solar industry has faced—and history shows that each time, it pushes forward stronger. At SPR, we remain fully committed to investing in the future of solar. We’re continuing to scale our operations, with plans to open a new regional recycling facility in 2025 and another in 2026, creating jobs and expanding USA-based recycling capacity at a time it’s needed most. We’ve built our business on innovation and we’ll continue to invest heavily in R&D and advanced recycling technology to support this industry at scale.”

Chris Hopper, chief executive officer, Aurora Solar

“Solar is one of the fastest, most scalable solutions for strengthening America’s energy resilience. Weakening incentives will slow our ability to meet demand, especially as AI and electrification accelerate energy use nationwide. Without solar, we risk overreliance on more expensive energy sources that take longer to bring online, compromising our economic competitiveness. While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we remain committed to our mission and to working with policymakers, partners, and our peers to continue building a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

Charlie Lord, managing principal, Renew Energy Partners

“Even as policy landscapes shift, demand for energy efficiency and distributed clean energy keeps growing, driven by grid constraints and AI growth, rising electricity costs, the attendant need for predictable energy costs, and the need for resiliency. The continued support for battery energy storage systems (BESS) and geothermal through the Investment Tax Credit is a critical signal that technologies enabling decarbonization and cost savings are here to stay.”

Keith Martin, partner, Norton Rose Fulbright on the Currents podcast

“In the short term, we’re all going to be extremely busy trying to get projects going at the outset of July 4, 2026. After that, I think people will have their heads down trying to develop and build these projects, finance them. There’ll be a distant place and service date for those… So I think we’ll do fine. Eventually there will be a new administration. Maybe people will be more concerned about climate change. We’ve seen this play before. These tax credits started in 1992 and they have expired, been restored, expired, been restored. So it’s perfectly possible we’ll see that again.”

Broadcast version by Eric Galatas for Colorado News Connection for the Public News Service/Daily Yonder Collaboration

In southwest Colorado, a rural electric cooperative is taking a big step towards energy independence and locally driven power decisions.

La Plata Electric Association (LPEA), a rural electric co-op for parts of Southwest Colorado, is in the middle of a two-year contract termination process to leave Tri-State, the generation and transmission organization that currently provides LPEA with electricity.

Rural electric cooperatives are member-owned, not-for-profit organizations that provide electricity to more than half of the country, including most of rural America. Established in the 1930s, electric co-ops were the government-backed response to a lack of investor-owned electric utilities in rural areas.

Venturing Out on Their Own

The cooperative model means that all customers of the electric co-op are also its owners. Each co-op has a member-elected board of directors that makes strategic decisions, most of which can be made without member approval, based on the bylaws of the individual co-op.

In March 2024, LPEA provided unconditional notice to leave Tri-State, starting a two-year stopwatch for the withdrawal from its contract and membership with the not-for-profit generation and transmission organization.

Leaving Tri-State ""will allow us to invest locally and it will allow us to invest in a way that helps bolster economic growth in our service territory,"" said Chris Hansen, CEO of LPEA in a Daily Yonder interview.

Despite the member-elected board having control over decisions like leaving Tri-State, some members feel misrepresented by their board and do not support the move away from the Tri-State contract.

Dale Ruggles, a member of LPEA, expressed concerns that the LPEA board of directors is making decisions that do not reflect the feelings of their constituents. When asked what he would have wanted to see done differently, Ruggles said he wanted ""a vote of the members, if the members vote to leave Tri-State, so be it"".

Local control, cheaper prices, and flexibility with sourcing are what co-ops like LPEA hope to gain by leaving contracts with their current power suppliers.

But members who are against leaving Tri-State, like Ruggles, say that they are worried about the cost that will be put onto members and the potential volatility of being on the open market instead of in a consistent contract like with Tri-State.

The withdrawal from Tri-State comes with what some of these members see as more than a $200 million price tag.""It's just too much debt, and they're not being transparent,"" said Ruggles to the Daily Yonder.

Hansen said that the money is a contract termination payment and not anything more than they were already contractually obligated to pay during their contract with Tri-State.

""It's not a punitive fine. It is the amount of debt we would have already had to pay if we stayed there,"" said LPEA board member Nicole Pitcher.

The payments are calculated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and are determined through a specific calculation that helps to maintain rate stability for the rest of Tri-State's members.

Moving Towards Renewables

Lee Boughey, VP of strategic communications for Tri-State, said that reliability and affordability are Tri-State's number one priorities. Boughey emphasized that Tri-State is owned and governed by its members - the distribution co-ops like LPEA all have representatives on the Tri-State board- and decisions like contracts are also dictated by the members. But part of that is allowing members to leave if Tri-State is not serving their own needs.

Rural electric co-ops are leading the way in energy innovation because of this member-driven governance. ""It's part of the co-op model to respond to local demand and to do innovation,"" said Gilbert Michaud, a professor of environmental policy at Loyola University Chicago.

Tri-State is going through its own transition, led by the members. In 2020, Tri-State announced their Responsible Energy Plan, which laid out their plan to move away from coal and towards renewables like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.

Boughey said that as renewable energy has become more affordable, generation and transmission co-ops like Tri-State have been able to invest in them more. ""For cooperatives, reliability and affordability are critical, so it's only natural that you would see cooperatives add more renewables as those prices came down,"" he said.

Until recently, cooperatives haven't been on the same playing field as investor-owned utilities when it comes to developing their own utilities. As a non-profit organization, Tri-State does not have access to renewable energy tax credits that are available to for-profit companies. Rural electric co-ops are now able to take advantage of direct pay tax credits, the result of legislation passed in 2022.

""We're among the first cooperative utilities in the country to own large [scale] solar, so that's exciting,"" said Boughey.

However, for LPEA, leaving Tri-State is still the right option, according to Hansen. He also said that leaving will lower the co-ops cost of electricity immediately, putting less pressure on rates.

""We've got lower wholesale contracts on the day we leave. On April 1, 2026, our wholesale power costs will come down,"" said Hansen. Some of that power will be coming from power purchase agreements with Tri-State, different from the contract, which would have locked them into Tri-State's rates until 2050.

The total bill for members won't necessarily go down, because of other increasing costs like infrastructure, but Hansen added that ""it takes the pressure off of our rate structure if your wholesale costs are flat or declining.""

Boughey also said that Tri-State's wholesale contracts keep costs down for its members. He said their contracts allow for more consistency, whereas being on the open market could have more volatility. Tri-State's rates have grown 2.46% between 2017 and 2025.

A Trend Across the Country and the Region

Attempting to get out of traditional electricity contracts is not unique to Colorado.

In South Dakota, in 2023, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision by a federal judge that Dakota Energy Cooperative could not leave its contract with its wholesale power supplier, East River Electric Power Cooperative.

Dakota Energy Cooperative wanted to buy energy from Guzman Energy, a for-profit company out of Denver, Colorado, which has been a partner to many rural electric co-ops looking to leave their long-term contracts. But in South Dakota, this became a question of local vs out-of-state, with East River Electric taking the stance that local is better, even if it was coal-powered energy compared to the renewables that Guzman offered.

On June 1, 2025, Indiana electric co-op Tipmont left its contract with its power supplier, Wabash Valley Power Alliance, after multiple years of negotiations.

In the Southwest, four other electric co-ops have left contracts with Tri-State over the last decade. Kit Carson Electric Coop, in Taos County, New Mexico, was the first in 2016.

As of 2022, Kit Carson has reached 100% daytime solar energy-all generated locally-something they never could have done under the Tri-State contract.

Kit Carson CEO Luis Reyes, who has worked at the co-op for over 40 years, said starting in the early 2000s, the Kit Carson member owners were concerned about committing to long-term contracts with Tri-State, which at the time was primarily buying and producing coal-powered electricity.

""The co-op program has been great. I think it's the best model to deliver electricity to everybody with the members being the focal point,"" said Reyes.""My opinion is we lost who the focal point was. We catered more to what Tri-State wanted than what our members wanted.""

Reyes says since Kit Carson left in 2016, Tri-State has ""really turned the ship,"" but in 2002 when Kit Carson first wanted to invest in renewables, ""solar was bad,"" Reyes said, according to the board members of Tri-State at the time. But for Reyes, ""it was good business, and it's what the members want."" For Reyes and Kit Carson, leaving Tri-State was the way to accomplish their solar and renewable goals that the members wanted.

Kit Carson completed their $37 million contract termination payment in 2022 six years after formally withdrawing from Tri-State. That year, Kit Carson said their power rates were lower than any Tri-State member.

The pressures from members leaving, decreasing prices of renewables, and new voices at the table have brought Tri-State a long way from ""solar was bad"". Current contracts, which Boughey said have been signed by most members, increase the amount of local power that members can generate from 5% to 20%, giving members a lot more flexibility to develop their own utilities.

A lot has changed at Tri-State since Kit Carson left Tri-State in 2016, and Boughey said that any member has the ability to pursue leaving at any time, if the current policies aren't working for them. They continue to have good relationships with co-ops that have left, including LPEA which is in the process of leaving now.

""It's not a negative issue,"" said Boughey. ""It's flexibility that our members want to have, that some members take advantage of, and we work very closely to execute those withdrawals in the spirit of the cooperative business model.

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.

The Michigan Innovation Fund is the largest funding proposal for the state's entrepreneurship ecosystem since the passage of the 21st Century Jobs Fund in 2005, Jennifer Hayes, senior vice president for operations and policy at Invest Detroit, previously told Crain’s.

It’s also Michigan’s first contribution to evergreen structured investment funds. An evergreen fund is an investment fund with no fixed end date, meaning investors can enter or exit the fund at various points throughout its life, and allows the fund manager to reinvest proceeds from successful exits into new opportunities.

“We remain grateful and committed to creating the environment for a higher probability of success for all involved in this process – from our governor to the state legislature, the entrepreneurs and startups who continue to bet on Michigan and our team at the MEDC, and partners from academia and elsewhere throughout Michigan’s increasingly vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem,” Quentin Messer Jr., CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corp., said in a news release.

ID Ventures, the investment arm of Invest Detroit, as well as Ann Arbor Spark, the University of Michigan Accelerate Blue Fund and the Michigan State University Research Foundation each receive $10.6 million from the fund. Western Michigan University Biosciences Research & Commercialization Center caps off the disbursement of existing evergreen funds with a $5.3 million investment.

InvestUP, which supports the state’s outdoor recreation VC fund Michigan Outdoor Investment Fund, Traverse City-headquartered 20Fathoms and Grand Valley Research Corp. will each receive $1.6 million to establish emerging evergreen funds.

“Access to capital is a particular challenge for entrepreneurs and startups here in the Traverse City region,” Craig Wesley, executive director at 20Fathoms, said in the release. “The Michigan Innovation Fund is an important step in a larger process to get much-needed funding to this region, and across the state.”

Most investments in Michigan-based startups are by private VC investors, not government-backed funds, Crain’s previously reported. Those government-backed funds are how Michigan’s competitors, such as Ohio, have been able to pull ahead of the state in ecosystem growth and return on investment.

The disbursement of the funds comes after a Business Leaders for Michigan report found that Michigan’s innovation economy ranks 32nd in growth funding compared to other states, as well as 36th in seed funding, 23rd in early-stage funding and 35th in late-stage funding.

The Michigan Innovation Fund draws funding from the Venture Michigan Fund, a venture capital fund investment program that was formed under the Michigan Early Stage Venture Investment Act of 2003. Investment proceeds are slated to be returned to the state in 2030, but Whitmer proposed to return $100 million early, with $60 million going to the Michigan Innovation Fund and $40 million to the general fund.

As part of the new Michigan Innovation Fund, the state will receive 10% of any return on investment that exceeds $8 million within 15 years after the initial investment. No less than 85% of the return on investment will be reinvested into the evergreen structured fund.

Invest Detroit spearheaded the movement to establish the Michigan Innovation Fund, earning Executive Vice President Patti Glaza recognition as part of Crain’s inaugural Women of Influence class.

Whitmer signed the package to establish the Michigan Innovation Fund in January, and the Michigan Strategic Fund board finalized the implementation of the funds with a vote in April.

According to the Michigan Innovation Fund website, $3 million of the remaining $7.2 million will be invested in universities or nonprofits that will support high-quality entrepreneurial programming with statewide economic impact.

The remaining $4.2 million is available to Michigan-based nonprofit organizations that provide qualified startup support services, through programs such as startup acceleration tracks, entrepreneurship and innovation convenings and more.

Mr Trump is expected to share details of the new initiatives at an event outside Pittsburgh, according to an administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the planning. Investments from a range of companies will include new data centres, power generation expansion and grid infrastructure upgrades, along with AI training programmes and apprenticeships, the official added.

Mr Trump will be joined by Republican Senator David McCormick who’s hosting the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University. AI and energy leaders, including as many as 60 executives, are expected to attend. Among those slated to participate are BlackRock’s Larry Fink, Palantir Technologies’ Alex Karp, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, Exxon Mobil’s Darren Woods and Chevron’s Mike Wirth, the official said.

Blackstone’s Jon Gray is expected to announce a US$25 billion project for data-centre and energy infrastructure development and a joint venture to increase power generation, which is expected to create 6,000 construction jobs annually and 3,000 permanent jobs, according to Mr Jake Murphy, a spokesman for McCormick.

Blackstone declined to comment. Axios reported the details of summit earlier.

The announcements on July 15 would mark the latest step by Mr Trump toward meeting his pledge of ensuring US leadership in artificial intelligence. Since the start of his second term, the president has taken a wide-ranging approach that includes drawing in private-sector investments, moving to ease regulations and accelerating the permit process for new projects.

Earlier in 2025, Mr Trump announced a US$100 billion investment in AI data centres from SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The administration has also rescinded the AI chip curbs imposed by former president Joe Biden’s administration as part of a broader effort to boost American innovation and ease US allies’ access to advanced technology.

The administration’s moves are aimed at keeping the US ahead of China in the race for an advantage in AI. China has invested significantly in the emerging technology, and the Chinese startup DeepSeek rattled investors on Wall Street in January with its breakthrough R1 model that suggested AI could be developed for far lower cost.

Mr Trump and other administration officials have also stressed the importance of meeting another tech industry priority: ensuring the US has enough power to run energy-hungry AI data centres. In their view, adequate electricity supply is intertwined with national security, essential to keeping the US ahead of global competitors in the race to dominate artificial intelligence.

By 2035, data centres are projected to account for 8.6 per cent of all US electricity demand, more than double their 3.5 per cent share today, according to data from Bloomberg NEF.

The Trump administration has said expanding the use of coal-fired power, along with electricity from natural gas and nuclear, is needed to help fuel the boom and has warned of future blackouts if the that fails to happen. The US Energy Department has already used emergency authority to keep two-power plants that were slated to close online, and has signaled additional federal intervention may be forthcoming.

By hosting the event in Pennsylvania, Mr Trump and McCormick are elevating the political importance of accelerating AI development. The Keystone state is a so-called battleground that Mr Biden won in 2020 and Mr Trump took 2024.

The event follows the closing of the US$14.1 billion

acquisition of Pittsburgh-based US Steel

by Nippon Steel, an agreement that ended a bruising takeover battle that was embroiled in American politics for months until finally gaining support from Mr Trump.

That deal is expected to domestic steel production and protect thousands of jobs.

The most celebrated event in the revival of fusion research came at the Geneva Superpower Summit in November 1985, when General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proposed a collaborative international project to develop fusion energy for peaceful purposes.
Until recently, the MIT Report says, the U.S. and Europe were the dominant public funders of fusion energy research and home to many of the world’s pioneering private sector fusion projects.
But in the past five years, China has upped its support for fusion energy to the point it threatens to dominate the industry.
But are the Europeans and Americans sufficiently focused – and willing to commit – to staying in the race and playing to win?","Nobody is saying it, but the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning may be springboarding the increased intensity of the competition for nuclear fusion – which many are now saying is far less than “30 years away.” The burning question among the few who are fully aware of the stakes in this race is “Who will get there first?” coupled with “Does first matter more than best?”

The greatest obstacle to fusion supplying the world with limitless electricity is learning how to maintain a balance between magnetic confinement and the severe heat (100 million degrees Celsius). Fusion produces cleaner energy than fission (its only byproducts are helium and other greenhouse gases – not radiation), and its fuels – deuterium and tritium – can easily be sourced from seawater and lithium. Scientists today are trying multiple ways to skin this cat.

Serious consideration of nuclear fusion began in the 1930s with the discovery of tritium by a research team led by experimental physicist Ernest Rutherford, who had earlier collaborated with Niels Bohr in the discovery of the neutron. In 1938, University of Michigan scientist Arthur Ruhlig proposed that deuterium-tritium fusion occurs with a very high probability when the two are brought into close proximity – but then World War II put fusion research into the freezer.

The most celebrated event in the revival of fusion research came at the Geneva Superpower Summit in November 1985, when General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proposed a collaborative international project to develop fusion energy for peaceful purposes. A year later the European Union (as Euratom), the U.S., Japan, and the Soviet Union agreed to jointly pursue the design for a large international fusion facility they called ITER (the way).

Fast forward to 2001. After 13 years of conceptual design work and detailed engineering design work, the final design for ITER was approved. Two years later the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea joined the project, with India coming on board in 2005, the year that ITER members agreed to site the gigantic project near Aix-en-Provence in France. A year later, the members formally created the ITER Organization with the goal of building theITER Tokamak, the world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion experiment.

Last November, the ITER Organization updated its baseline proposal to prioritize a “robust start” to scientific exploitation with a more complete machine than initially planned – with a divertor, blanket shield blocks, and other key components and systems. These are to be in place in time for the first operational phase for the tokamak, Start of Research Operation.

This first phase features hydrogen and deuterium-deuterium plasmas that culminate in operating the machine in long pulses at full magnetic energy and plasma current. The goal is to achieve full magnetic energy by 2036 and the start of the deuterium-tritium operation phase in 2039 (rather than 2033 and 2035, as originally planned).

Meanwhile, both public and private (and public-private) entities have not sat around waiting for ITER to generate limitless energy in southern France. Instead, there is a growing race among nations and corporations to find quicker ways to turn straw into gold – or rather hydrogen into electricity and more. Western nations, already left in the dust on lithium-ion battery and other technologies and supply chains by the Chinese, now fear that China may win this race too.

Just last month China announced that its Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) – its artificial sun -- had broken its own record by confining plasma for nearly 18 minutes, longest in the world to date. That might sound like a small step toward the mandatory requirement that a fusion device maintain stable operation at high efficiency without interruption to continuously generate electric power.

That is one reason that a recent report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology warned that “The U.S. and other Western countries will have to build strong supply chains across a range of technologies in addition to creating the fundamental technology behind practical fusion power plants” to stay in the race at all. One of China’s overall strengths, and the West’s weaknesses, has revolved around investment in supply chains and scaling up complex production processes.

Until recently, the MIT Report says, the U.S. and Europe were the dominant public funders of fusion energy research and home to many of the world’s pioneering private sector fusion projects. But in the past five years, China has upped its support for fusion energy to the point it threatens to dominate the industry.

To compete, the U.S. and its allies and partners must invest more heavily not only in fusion itself—which is already happening—but also in those adjacent technologies that are critical to the fusion industrial base. The MIT Report says that China already has leadership in three of the six key industries needed for constructing tokamaks -- thin-film processing, large metal-alloy structures, and power electronics. The West has little time to cash in on its opportunity to lead in cryo-plants, fuel processing, and blankets -- the medium used to absorb energy from the fusion reaction and to breed tritium.

China is the world leader in thin-film, high-volume manufacturing for solar panels and flat-panel displays, with the associated expert workforce, tooling sector, infrastructure, and upstream materials supply chain needed to manufacture rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconductors – the highest performing materials for use in fusion magnets. China’s high-speed rail industry, renewable microgrids, and arc furnaces give it an edge as well in large-scale power electronics, and Chinas’ manufacturing capacity and metallurgical research efforts position it well to outcompete the world in specialty metal allows machined for fusion tokamaks.

But are the Europeans and Americans sufficiently focused – and willing to commit – to staying in the race and playing to win? As Euractiv reported this week, Christophe Grudler, an influential member of the European Parliament’s industry committee, is hardly sanguine.

Grudler stated before a gathering of politicians and stakeholders at a Fusion for Energy event that “There is a lack of political leadership [at the European Commission] when it comes to nuclear energy in Europe…. Only 2% of the global amount of fusion investment is currently going to Europe, while 75% is going to the U.S.”

Seconding his concern, Massimo Garribba, deputy chief of the Commission’s energy department, said the intent is there for fusion but there needs to be a larger strategic focus that goes beyond financing. There is plenty of money and enough wonderful people, but “you don’t have an ecosystem of facilities which actually drives toward having a functioning system at the end of the day.”

As for the U.S., the Department of Energy last November released its DOE Fusion Energy Strategy 2024, the second step in its comprehensive effort to work with the private sector to accelerate “the feasibility of commercial fusion energy.” The DOE’s own plan tacitly admits that the U.S. is playing in catch-up mode.

Several U.S.-based private sector projects are under way, including those reliant on stellarators rather than tokamaks, but none have confined plasma for anything near 18 minutes, and there are huge questions about the supply chain needed to support a fusion industry. Regulatory reforms on the way may help – but what happens if today’s protesters turn on the nuclear industry?

About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.
Indian air conditioners are inefficient Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.
“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.

Altering the rules proposal will kick off another 60-day public comment period without altogether restarting the process once the amended rules are published on July 21.
Regulators plan to hold a remote public hearing on the amended proposal in September and are aiming to approve the rules in January before the end of Gov.
The state’s amended proposal would require 4 feet of elevation for new or substantially improved construction, down from 5 feet under the original plan.
It was not immediately clear how many homes and other buildings were removed from proposed flood maps as a result.","New Jersey’s environmental regulator will loosen a series of controversial proposed flood rules in response to shifting climate data and public outcry, according to Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette.

The changes to the department’s proposed flood rules — called Protection Against Climate Threats Resilient Environments and Landscape Rule, or Pact Real — would lower a contentious elevation requirement, add language exempting affordable housing from some rules, and allow some ongoing projects to be completed under existing rules, among other things.

“It is critical that, as we work to advance the protection of our coastal and our inland communities, that we’re meeting people where they are and we’re listening to the concerns and the need for clarity that come from our coastal communities,” LaTourette told reporters Monday.

Altering the rules proposal will kick off another 60-day public comment period without altogether restarting the process once the amended rules are published on July 21. Regulators plan to hold a remote public hearing on the amended proposal in September and are aiming to approve the rules in January before the end of Gov. Phil Murphy’s second term.

Most notably, the new proposal uses a more conservative estimate of sea level rise over the next 75 years that officials said was driven by new modeling. Those forecasts peg global temperature rises over the next 75 years at 2.7 degrees Celsius, rather than 3.3.

They said the shift reduced the most severe sea level rise models from 5.1 feet by 2100 to 4.4 feet. The state’s amended proposal would require 4 feet of elevation for new or substantially improved construction, down from 5 feet under the original plan.

“We’re hearing from our coastal communities that they’re comfortable with a higher level of risk, and we need to consider that in how we move forward,” LaTourette said.

Business groups and shore residents had chaffed at the five-foot provision, arguing it would raise the price of construction in an already expensive state based on a scenario that modeling said had only a 17% chance of occurring.

The amended proposal’s reduction did little to assuage those concerns.

“They really have not addressed the serious concerns and the underlying problems with this rule. It seems to be more window dressing and still not based on the latest science,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.

By lowering its expectations for sea-level rise, the state will also slow the expansion of its flood maps. The original proposal was set to add 1.5% of New Jersey’s terrestrial area to flood maps, while the amended one will add about 1%.

It was not immediately clear how many homes and other buildings were removed from proposed flood maps as a result. Officials said updated flood maps would be released next week, adding that the change in covered structures was not linear with the change in flood map area.

Environmentalists see the changes as a backslide that could imperil New Jerseyans amid the growing frequency of severe storms and flooding.

“These rollbacks by the Murphy administration’s DEP in this rule proposal, they seem to contradict the original intent of these rules, which was to protect more communities and adopt more measures to reduce flooding in our coastal communities,” said Doug O’Malley, executive director of Environment New Jersey. “Clearly, we’re disappointed.”

The proposal requires officials to reexamine flooding rules every five years, and elevation standards could see further changes during those reviews.

The new version of the proposal will include language explicitly naming affordable housing as a compelling public need that could win exemptions to some flood rules. Some local officials had warned that proposed provisions limiting construction in flood-prone areas could impact their ability to meet affordable housing obligations.

LaTourette said that exempt affordable housing projects may be required to adopt other mitigation methods.

“There are public safety standards built into that hardship exception, so we can take a look, work with the developer, look at the plans, and decide whether flexibility is appropriate here because there are still things that can be done that will still protect the public and the residents of that building,” he said.

The amendments eliminate language that would have subjected the state’s inundation risk zone — the portions of New Jersey forecast to be permanently underwater or subject to daily flooding tides by 2100 — to strict impervious coverage requirements that critics warned would bar all building in even sparsely developed coastal areas.

Department of Environmental Protection officials maintained the prior proposal created no so-called “no-build zones,” noting they already review development projects in other designated special areas. But they acknowledged the provision had spurred concern among local officials and builders that development might be entirely barred in flood-prone areas.

“That, of course, was never the intent, and we want to make sure we are erasing that concern from people’s minds,” said Jennifer Moriarty, assistant commissioner for watershed and land management. “It isn’t going to happen. It never was.”

The amended proposal includes a grace period for ongoing projects. Developers can submit their applications up to 180 days after the Pact Real rules are approved and still have their projects governed by prior rules. Under the original proposal, they would have been subject to the new rules immediately.

As the climate crisis intensifies, the ability to move clean energy efficiently and reliably will become increasingly important for governments and utilities.","In short:

Democrats are demanding investigations into whether staffing cuts and budget reductions at the National Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the Trump administration worsened the impact of flooding that killed over 100 people in Texas.

The White House and Republican lawmakers deny any connection between federal agency changes and the disaster, calling such claims politically motivated and misleading.

Multiple bills are being proposed to reform FEMA, bolster disaster preparedness, and address communication issues during emergencies, including efforts to make alerts available in more languages.

Key quote:

“The President threatening to eliminate FEMA, firing scientists, and muzzling experts helps no one and puts us all in danger.”

— Bennie Thompson, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee

Why this matters:

Floods are getting deadlier and more frequent as the climate warms and infrastructure ages, but federal disaster response and forecasting systems are being asked to do more with less. When agencies like NOAA or FEMA face staff shortages and budget cuts, it can mean slower warnings, missed threats, and communities left without help in the aftermath. Forecasting errors or communication gaps during extreme weather events can cost lives. If the public loses trust in these agencies, or if their capacity shrinks further, the nation’s safety net for climate-fueled disasters could erode just as demand for it is rising.

Read more: Texas flooding puts scaled-back FEMA under scrutiny

In short:

Trump’s administration is considering reforms that would make it harder for states to qualify for FEMA assistance and cap how much of the recovery costs the agency will cover, threatening California’s ability to respond to worsening natural disasters.

FEMA has already rescinded nearly $900 million in disaster-preparedness grants, including wildfire prevention funds in Napa County, and delayed disbursing key emergency management grants with no public explanation.

With California’s $12 billion budget deficit and rising disaster frequency, state and local officials say they can’t replace lost federal funding, even as some FEMA payouts for individuals remain minimal or are simply denied.

Key quote:

“They’re just cutting these projects even though they have proven benefit cost analyses in place.”

— Laurie Schoeman, senior adviser on climate resilience to former President Joe Biden

Why this matters:

Climate-fueled disasters are growing more frequent, intense, and expensive. In California, wildfires now destroy entire neighborhoods, displace tens of thousands, and strain public systems for years after the flames are out. FEMA has long helped states shoulder the burden, covering a major share of disaster response and recovery costs. But under the Trump administration's new approach, the federal government is stepping back, pulling funds for prevention projects and making it harder for states to access aid. This shift could force local governments to choose between rebuilding homes, maintaining emergency services, or preparing for the next crisis.

In short:

A group of 139 EPA workers who signed a letter condemning Trump administration policies were put on leave, prompting union outcry.

The letter accused the agency of ignoring science and dismantling environmental programs, including those supporting environmental justice.

The employees’ union argues the suspension violates free speech rights and federal protections for whistleblowers.

Key quote:

""These employees engaged in protected speech on a matter of significant public concern, and their actions are fully protected by federal law and our collective bargaining agreement.""

— Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238

Why this matters:

Silencing federal scientists and staff for speaking out undermines transparency and trust in public health and environmental protections. The union representing these employees says the agency’s action reeks of political retaliation. These are the people who sounded alarms as climate policy was gutted, as environmental justice programs were shelved, and as public health protections were rolled back with the stroke of a pen. It's causing many to ask: If scientists and regulators can’t criticize the EPA — the very agency tasked with protecting health and the planet — then who will?

What’s happening to EPA-funded community projects under Trump?

Pennsylvania health advocates say Trump’s first 100 days in office have caused “100 harms” to local communities

In short:

The EPA launched new public webpages outlining what it knows about contrails and geoengineering, addressing theories that linked these to catastrophic flooding in Texas.

The agency reaffirmed that contrails are condensation trails and not evidence of chemical spraying, stating it found no scientific basis for claims about military or covert operations.

The agency is reviewing the actions of Make Sunsets, a private firm releasing sulfur dioxide for solar geoengineering, citing concerns about pollution and the need for regulatory oversight.

Key quote:

“There are scientists who work at the Environmental Protection Agency who could explain water vapor and condensation to [Zeldin] but unfortunately he is trying to fire all of them.”

— Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer

Why this matters:

Claims that weather events are being artificially engineered have gained traction in some political circles and online platforms, often overshadowing scientific consensus and distracting from pressing environmental concerns. Understanding the science — and separating fact from fiction — is vital for sound policy and public trust.

In short:

Warmer temperatures are changing the timing and intensity of South Asia’s monsoon rains, leading to more frequent flash floods and droughts across India, Pakistan, Nepal, and neighboring countries.

Scientists report that glacial melt is accelerating across the Himalayan region, placing hundreds of high-altitude glacial lakes at risk of overflowing and threatening downstream communities.

Rapid urban growth and shrinking floodplains are amplifying the damage, while experts warn that current disaster responses are reactive and lack long-term planning.

Key quote:

“If we continue with, you know, business as usual, and we have the same kind of emissions, then the world is going to keep on getting warmer and there will be more intense rain and floods. At some point, we could go beyond the limits of adaptation.""

— Miriam Jackson, glaciologist at the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative

Why this matters:

South Asia’s shifting monsoon is a growing public health and environmental crisis. Home to nearly two billion people, the region depends heavily on seasonal rains for drinking water and agriculture. But rising global temperatures are making those rains more intense and dangerous. The atmosphere holds more moisture, which can fall all at once, flooding cities and washing out crops. Rural areas face drought when the rain doesn’t come at all. Melting glaciers add another layer of risk, creating unstable lakes in the Himalayas that can burst and destroy entire villages downstream. As the region urbanizes, drainage systems struggle to keep up, leaving millions exposed to disaster.

In short:

Operation Green Shield, led by the United Arab Emirates and coordinated through a climate-focused law enforcement initiative, targeted illegal resource extraction and trafficking across Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

Authorities recovered 2,100 live animals, 6,350 dead specimens, 310 tons of raw minerals, and dismantled organized crime cells operating in Indigenous territories.

Real-time satellite tracking and cross-border collaboration helped law enforcement conduct more than 350 synchronized raids over a two-week period.

Key quote:

""Environmental crime displaces communities, fuels violence against women and children, and erodes cultural heritage. These are not just crimes against nature — they are crimes against people.”

— Lt. Col. Dana Humaid, director-general of the International Affairs Bureau at the UAE Ministry of Interior

Why this matters:

Environmental crime in the Amazon Basin is a web of illegal mining, smuggling, and wildlife trade that fuels organized crime and endangers some of the world’s most biodiverse and culturally rich ecosystems. These activities strip land from Indigenous communities, poison water with mercury, and drive species extinction. When enforcement fails, vulnerable populations bear the brunt of pollution, displacement, and violence. The Amazon’s fate is closely tied to the global climate system; continued environmental degradation there could disrupt rainfall patterns, accelerate carbon emissions, and destabilize efforts to curb warming.

In short:

A Boston Consulting Group analysis finds a €250 billion shortfall in planned European power grid investments from 2025 to 2029, despite a planned tripling of capital expenditures to €345 billion.

Demand is being driven by electrification, data centers, AI growth, renewables integration, and aging infrastructure, even as recent blackouts in Spain, Portugal, and the Czech Republic raise concerns about grid resilience.

Transmission system operators are facing financial strain, with rising debt loads and limited access to equity markets, and will need to bridge the gap through debt, asset sales, or reduced shareholder payouts.

Key quote:

""Without rapid innovation in how we finance grid infrastructure, Europe risks having world-class renewable generation that can't reach consumers because the grid hasn't kept pace.""

— Tom Brijs, BCG partner and co-author of the report

Why this matters:

Europe is pushing hard to decarbonize by adding renewable energy sources, yet those clean electrons won’t matter if the wires can’t carry them where they’re needed. Add in rising demand from electric vehicles, heat pumps, and data centers powered by AI, and the pressure on outdated infrastructure grows. Blackouts threaten public health, food security, and economic stability. As the climate crisis intensifies, the ability to move clean energy efficiently and reliably will become increasingly important for governments and utilities.

After a multi-year fight against former President Joe Biden’s energy, climate and environmental policies, Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has corralled 18 other Republican attorneys general to back President Donald Trump and his energy policies.

Knudsen, who has led the Montana Department of Justice since 2021, is attempting to enter the judicial ring in a constitutional fight over three executive orders Trump issued earlier this year to “unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources.” In May, 22 young Americans — including 10 involved in the Held v. Montana constitutional climate lawsuit the state Supreme Court decided in the plaintiffs’ favor late last year —filed a lawsuit to undo the executive orders.

The lead plaintiff is Eva Lighthiser, a 19-year-old Livingston resident. In May, Lighthiser said Trump is “waging war” on her and her co-plaintiffs, who are “fighting back with the Constitution.” More specifically, the plaintiffs argue in the 126-page lawsuit they filed in the U.S. District Court in Missoula that Trump is threatening their rights to life and liberty. They also invoke a separation-of-powers claim, a constitutional argument frequently cited in the hundreds of lawsuits that have arisen in response to Trump’s aggressive second-term agenda.

“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” Lighthiser and her co-plaintiffs contend in their request that judges toss the orders out. “Plaintiffs’ lives are presently harmed by the ‘unleashing’ of fossil fuel pollution, and their injuries will get worse as the directives continue to be implemented.”

In his motion to intervene, Knudsen argued that states like Montana are uniquely positioned to enter the legal arena to defend Trump’s energy agenda.

“The State of Montana has an interest in this case because it will directly impact the business done in the energy sector within its borders, as well as the employment implications and development implications involved that will impact so many of its citizens,” the filing reads. “Only the State Intervenors have the capacity, competency, and incentives to represent their unique interests not shared by the Federal Defendants.”

In a statement about Montana’s bid to join the litigation, Our Children’s Trust argued that fear is motivating the red states’ move to intervene. Over the last decade and a half, the Oregon-based nonprofit has filed dozens of lawsuits to force the government to act on climate change.

“Since President Trump returned to office, over 450 lawsuits have been filed challenging executive orders or the agency actions taken to carry them out. Out of all of those cases, only one has triggered a coalition of 19 states and a U.S. territory to intervene — this one. That speaks volumes,” Our Children’s Trust Chief Legal Counsel Julia Olson said in the press release. “Their intervention confirms what we already know: this constitutional rights case is vitally important, urgent, and it is exposing unlawful policies they are desperate to defend.”

Both sides would likely agree that the Treasure State is a fitting backdrop for a fight over energy development: Montana has an abundance of the types of resources — coal, natural gas, copper and rare earth elements — that the White House is set on extracting. (See “Public Comment,” below.)

Public Comment 🗣️

The Bureau of Land Management is taking comment on a proposal to reopen the Powder River Basin to coal leasing as part of President Donald Trump’s move to reverse his predecessor’s energy and climate policies.

The Powder River Basin, which spans southeastern Montana and northeastern Wyoming, holds the largest coal reserves in the United States. Some of the coal mined in the area is bound for U.S. power plants, while some is shipped overseas. Last May, former President Joe Biden announced that no new mines would be permitted in the area, citing the decline in coal production over the past two decades and the climate and public health impacts of continued coal burning. Burning coal to create electricity is a significant source of greenhouse gas, contributing to some of the largest releases of carbon dioxide in the country and the globe.

Environmental groups and ranchers wary of coal mining’s impact on water supplies, air quality and livestock forage celebrated the move by the Biden-era BLM. Mark Fix, a Miles City-area rancher and member of Northern Plains Resource Council, argued last year that it was about time the federal government started protecting taxpayers from “wasting publicly-owned resources on lowball leases to subsidize an industry in decline.” But the move irked statewide GOP politicians like U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, who said that it would weaken rural economies and destabilize the country’s electricity grid.

Now, the BLM is taking comment on the plan to open up 2,600 square miles — an area larger than Delaware — to new or expanded coal mines. In Montana, the area spans 17 counties, encompassing 2.7 million acres of BLM-administered land and 11.7 million acres of federal mineral estate.

The agency is accepting comments through Aug. 7. More specifically, the BLM is interested in hearing about the scope of the proposal, potential alternatives and any studies or relevant information that merit consideration.

The move came just days after Trump signed a massive budget bill that reduces the royalty rate for federal coal leasing from 12.5% to 7%, further unwinding Biden’s work to reshape the country’s energy landscape.

Verbatim 💬

“Are you guys detaining him separate from the traffic stop?”

“Yeah, he’s like getting deported.”

— An exchange between Helena Police Officer Seth Montgomery and an unnamed federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer recorded on body camera footage after officers pulled over Christopher Martinez Marvan on July 1 in Helena.

Police and ICE officers were searching for two Venezuelan men in the area when they stopped Martinez Marvan, a 31-year-old Helena resident and Mexican national. Officers determined he was not one of the men they were looking for, and Montgomery wrote up a citation for driving without a license. The footage shows that when Montgomery got out of his car with the ticket, federal officers were taking Martinez Marvan, who was ultimately detained in the Cascade County Detention Center in Great Falls.

During a hearing in federal district court in Missoula on Thursday, Martinez Marvan’s attorneys argued officers pulled him over because he was Latino and therefore similar in appearance to the men they were searching for, an action that made his detention unlawful. Molly Danahy, litigation director of Upper Seven Law, asked Judge Dana Christensen to order Martinez Marvan’s release and prevent evidence gathered during the stop from being used to immediately re-detain him.

Attorneys representing the government said Christensen does not have jurisdiction over the case, and it should move to immigration court. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Weldon said Martinez Marvan is not being detained illegally because he was driving a truck with an expired registration. Weldon also cited a warrant for arrest and notice to appear in immigration court that federal authorities submitted to Christensen’s court on Thursday.

Christensen has not ruled on the case as of early Friday afternoon.

3 Questions

When Indian Health Service opened the Little Shell Tribal Health Clinic in Great Falls three years ago, Little Shell Chair Gerald Gray said it was the tribe’s plan to assume ownership one day. Indian Health Service (IHS) is the federal entity responsible for providing health care to federally recognized tribes. The agency is chronically underfunded, and tribes nationwide have long called for an improved care system. In Montana, Native Americans die about 17 years earlier than their white neighbors, and experts attribute that disparity, in part, to the overburdened IHS.

Tribes have the option to take control of some federally run programs, like health care, through a process commonly called “638.” Enacted in 1975, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, allows tribes to contract with the federal government to operate programs that serve tribal members.

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes on the Flathead Reservation and the Chippewa Cree Tribe on the Rocky Boy’s Reservation have each assumed ownership of their health clinics through that process. Other tribes, like the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux, have taken control of some health care services.

Gray said in an interview with Montana Free Press that the 638 process was long and arduous. It requires years of clean tribal government financial audits and negotiations with IHS. But on July 1, the Little Shell Tribe officially took control of the health clinic, a move that Gray said “reflects our long-standing commitment to self-determination.”

We spoke with Gray about the significance of operating the clinic and what it will mean for the tribe and its members. Responses are edited for length and clarity.

MTFP: Why was assuming ownership of the clinic a goal for the tribe?

Gray: It all stemmed from a trip to Alaska, where we got to go visit the Southcentral Foundation, which is the health care for all [Alaska Native] villages. And they provide a system of care called Nuka. It’s more about the whole person, the whole body. The best way to describe it is if you go in to see a doctor and let’s say something is bothering your knee. A team will look at your chart and say, “You know, you also haven’t had your teeth cleaned in a while. Can we set you up with a dentist? And also you probably need to have this exam.” It’s all very preventative care. IHS doesn’t offer that. I just thought that would be much better for our citizens. And we just feel we know our citizens better and can provide that next level of care, preventative care instead of reactive care.

MTFP: What will this mean for patients and for clinic employees in the short- and long-term?

Gray: We haven’t fully implemented it yet, because it’s only been a week. But what they’ll see is there will be a team approach to care. Right now when you go in there, it’s pretty much the same until we get providers and staff trained in that system of care. … We’re also expanding the clinic because we did get some money from the state. We’re going to create a behavioral health and counseling room where you can do group sessions. I’m really excited about that. And once the Nuka system has been established, we’ll have iPads readily available for our citizens. They really are going to be customers. Without them, we wouldn’t have this. They’re not patients, they’re actually customer-owners. And when they come in, they’re going to be able to do a survey [on the iPad] so we can always be improving the system of care.

MTFP: Can you elaborate on that distinction between being treated like a patient versus being treated like a customer?

Gray: In the typical setting, if you go to the doctor, you’re a patient and you’re seen in a way where they try to see as many [patients] as they can so they can bill [for services]. A customer is someone who is much more appreciated, and we want to provide that whole care, that preventative care. Then you’re not going to have a whole bunch of sick citizens because you’re getting that care. It’s just a more respectful way to treat people.

In a recent letter to Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright, the Grain Belt Express says it's been the target of an ""unwarranted and unhinged crusade"" through media attacks from Missouri Republicans.

The letter follows U.S. Senator Josh Hawley's announcement on X Thursday declaring he'd to put a stop to the project.

Meanwhile, just a week prior, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey into the project, accusing the company of misleading the public and misrepresenting the benefits of the project.

In a letter to the DOE Friday, Grain Belt Express appealed to the Trump administration's infrastructure agenda, arguing Hawley and Bailey ""are declaring open season on America’s ability to build needed energy infrastructure.""

Unfortunately, the Grain Belt Express has been the target of egregious politically motivated lawfare. Senator Hawley and AG Bailey have pursued an unwarranted and unhinged crusade against the Grain Belt Express through media attacks and letters to you seeking rescission of the Grain Belt Express’ conditionally approved DOE loan guarantee, as well as AG Bailey’s own separate consumer protection investigation and request to the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) to reopen its Grain Belt approval. Recent false accusations from Senator Hawley and AG Bailey saying that the Grain Belt Express will cost America billions instead of saving us billions, whether mistaken or purposefully declared, are misleading at best.""

The company says 800-mile wind energy pipeline would be the highest capacity and second longest line in U.S. history, carrying up to 5,000 megawatts of energy from Kansas through Missouri, Illinois and into Indiana.

By connecting four U.S. grid regions—also a historic first—the Grain Belt Express will deliver cost savings and strengthen reliability for 29 states and D.C., more than 40% of Americans, and 25% of Department of Defense installations.""

Grain Belt Express says all the questions Attorney General Bailey has raised were all already considered and decided by the Missouri Public Service Commission during a lengthy and rigorous regulatory process that lasted nearly three years. The project itself has been in the works for more than a decade.

This procedural abuse is a waste of public resources and is harmful to Missourians and all Americans, both of whom will directly benefit from the project. For the Trump administration, however, this attack is even more harmful, because it puts reliability, resiliency, and affordability of all types of energy at risk.""

In Missouri, energy bills could spike by $640 annually [1].
This shift is expected to drive up energy costs, particularly in states that have not enacted their own policies to boost renewables.
The rise in energy costs comes at a time when electricity prices for American households have already increased above the rate of inflation since 2022.
Around 34 million households reported difficulties in paying energy bills in 2020.","Household energy bills in some Republican-leaning states could rise by more than $600 every year, according to a new analysis of the reconciliation spending bill signed by former President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. The legislation, dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill,"" is poised to increase electricity rates by up to 18% by 2035, with states that voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election bearing the brunt of the increases [1].

The analysis, conducted by Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy thinktank, estimates that by 2035, household energy costs will rise by an average of $170 per year. The states most affected include Missouri, Kentucky, South Carolina, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Texas, which all voted for Trump in the 2024 election. In Missouri, energy bills could spike by $640 annually [1].

The reconciliation bill strips away support for cheap solar and wind energy production, forcing utilities to rely more heavily on existing, inefficient gas generators. This shift is expected to drive up energy costs, particularly in states that have not enacted their own policies to boost renewables. ""Demand for electricity is increasing and without renewables we aren’t able to meet that new demand,"" said Dan O’Brien, senior analyst at Energy Innovation and author of the new study [1].

The bill also seeks to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap), which aids around 6 million US households with their bills, and deletes subsidies for the construction of energy-efficient homes and upgrades to home cooling, heating, and insulation systems. This assistance is crucial for energy-insecure households, who often struggle to meet the cost of heating, cooling, and lighting their homes [1].

The rise in energy costs comes at a time when electricity prices for American households have already increased above the rate of inflation since 2022. Around 34 million households reported difficulties in paying energy bills in 2020. Lower-income people, as well as those who are Black, Hispanic, elderly, have young children, or live in poorly constructed and badly insulated homes, are most at risk of this sort of energy insecurity [1].

Extreme heat is the leading weather-related cause of deaths in the US, with advancing global temperatures due to the burning of fossil fuels causing longer and fiercer heatwaves. This summer in the US is expected to be hotter than the long-term norm for the season, with explosive demand for cooling causing a strain upon the grid in some places. In June, 110,000 people in New York City lost power due to a surge of electricity use during a hot spell [1].

In the hottest parts of the US, lengthy power blackouts could prove catastrophic. If a prolonged heatwave and a blackout hit Phoenix, Arizona, at the same time, half of the city’s 1.6 million residents would require urgent medical help and 1% of the population would die, a 2023 study warned [1].

President Donald Trump (R) says for too long, the federal government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize “expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar.” He has voiced support for fairness in the energy sector while removing the market distortions created by the subsidies.

That is why Trump says he issued an executive order last week following the passage of the “one big, beautiful bill” aimed at ending the massive cost of “the taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources.”

“The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape,” Trump outlined in the order. “Moreover, reliance on so-called ‘green’ subsidies threatens national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries.”

The move was welcome news for Mississippi Public Service Commission chairman Chris Brown (R).

“Mississippi families and businesses deserve energy they can depend on, not intermittent power that destabilizes our electric grid,” said the Northern District Commissioner. “I thank President Trump for this bold step to end market-distorting subsidies that favor unreliable ‘green’ energy over strong, dispatchable sources like nuclear, coal, natural gas, and emerging technologies.”

As outlined in the order, the President directs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities with 45 days and order the Department of the Interior to remove preferential treatment for wind and solar. Trump also directs Bessent to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

By SBE Council at 14 July, 2025, 2:33 pm

by Raymond J. Keating –

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that was signed into law by President Trump includes important tax relief measures for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Provisions regarding energy in the legislation will also be positive for small businesses – not only in terms of producing a more reliable and affordable supply of energy for small business consumers, but also for the small firms that dominate the U.S. energy sector.

The main emphasis of the energy provisions is to remove governmental barriers to increased energy production, as well as the federal government stepping back from subsidies and preferences based on politics. Among the constructive energy measures included in the act, as highlighted by the Institute for Energy Research, are:

• It mandates “new oil and natural gas lease sales across federal lands and waters, unlinking them from renewables leasing and restoring royalty rates to pre-Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) levels. The law also reinstates full deductions for intangible drilling costs, delays the methane emissions fee until 2035 — providing the industry with more time to prepare — and increases the carbon capture tax credit for producers that utilize carbon dioxide to increase oil recovery.”

• “The law phases out clean electricity investment and production tax credits for wind and solar after decades of coverage. Originally intended for nascent industries, the investment credit was significantly enhanced in 2005, having been initially introduced in 1978 and having been extended 15 times.”

• “The bill eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicle (EV) purchases and leases, as well as the $4,000 credit for used EVs, effective September 30.”

Undertakings like solar and wind power, and electric vehicles should stand or fall based on market competition and consumer sovereignty, not based on politics overruling the choices made in the marketplace.

EnergyIntel.com also noted: “…the reversal of an IRA-era corporate tax policy regarding how alternative minimum tax is calculated was applauded by the likes of the American Petroleum Institute and the American Exploration & Production Council… Specifically, the change once again allows producers to fully deduct so-called intangible drilling costs, which encompass roughly 60%-80% of well costs. The IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] only allowed a portion of these costs to be deducted.”

Reducing government costs to energy investment, while at the same time reducing distortive and wasteful subsidies, amounts to a solid energy policy combination, along with other broader provisions that avoid tax increases for entrepreneurs and small businesses on income and investment.

As SBE Council has noted before, the energy sector is not just about larger businesses. In reality, energy industries are overwhelmingly populated by small businesses. For example, consider the breakdown of employer firms by firm size in various energy industries:

Published July 14, 2025

By Conor MacDonald, Financial Strategies Attorney, Charles Slidders, Manager and Senior Attorney, and Lindsey Jurca, Senior Communications Campaign Specialist, at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL)

More than 120 deaths have been reported, and at least 161 people remain missing after catastrophic floods tore through Central Texas on July 4. The death toll is expected to rise. As communities reel from the tragedy, the question remains: will anything change?

Over the last 12 months, hundreds of Americans have died in disasters made deadlier and more likely by climate change. Yet, the US government and many state and local leaders continue to deny and otherwise downplay the climate emergency. How many lives will be lost before our leaders confront reality?

A Year of Climate-Driven Catastrophes, With More To Come

The floods in Hill Country, Texas are only the most recent in a devastating string of climate disasters across the US in the last year alone.

In September 2024, Hurricane Helene killed more than 200 people in North Carolina and drenched the Southeast with 20 trillion gallons of rain — 50 percent more than would have fallen without climate change, according to experts.

This January, wildfires swept across Los Angeles, killing 30 people in what were some of the most destructive fires in the city’s history. Fueled by extreme heat, record winds, and historic drought — conditions exacerbated by climate change, the fires were a reminder of the human causes and consequences of global warming and the disasters it fuels. The smoke may lift, but the consequences will linger, reshaping lives and landscapes for years to come.

In March, a deadly tornado outbreak tore through much of the Midwest and South, killing 42 people. It was the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded for the month of March, again, made more likely by a warming climate.

Just two months later, in mid-May, a severe tornado outbreak struck the Midwestern and Southeastern United States, spawning 60 tornadoes and claiming 27 more lives.

Tornadoes emerge from powerful thunderstorms, and climate change is making these storms more frequent and more intense. As the atmosphere warms and holds more moisture, the conditions that fuel tornadoes — like those seen in March and May — are arriving earlier, occurring more often, and leaving behind more destruction.

Despite the relentless and deadly reminders of climate change, the US administration remains in denial. Just last week, they replaced hundreds of scientists and experts working on the federal government’s flagship climate impacts report with known climate skeptics.

The Texas Floods, The Cost of Climate Denial

Just a month before the floods, NASA released new research showing a sharp rise in the intensity, frequency, duration, and severity of extreme weather events —including floods — over the past five years. The Texas floods are another example of the devastating extreme weather events fueled by rising temperatures and human-caused climate change.

The fatal Texas flooding began with torrential downpours that overwhelmed the Guadalupe River and its tributaries. In a matter of hours, more than 10 inches of rain fell, causing the river to rise nearly 29 feet in less than an hour. This kind of extreme rainfall has become far more likely in our warming world.

As Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, put it, “Climate change is like steroids for the weather — it injects an extra dose of intensity into existing weather patterns.” Global temperatures have already risen 1.5℃, on average. Warmer air holds more water vapor, enabling bigger downpours and more intense rainfall. At least 1.8 trillion gallons of rain fell over the impacted area.

Arsum Pathak, Director of Adaptation and Coastal Resilience at the National Wildlife Federation, explained it simply: “The atmosphere is like a giant sponge. As the air gets warmer, which is what’s been happening because of climate change, the sponge can hold a lot more water. And then when there’s a storm, the same sponge can squeeze out way more water than it used to.”

In Texas, warmer temperatures mean storms like this one are now up to 7 percent wetter than during similar storms in the past. The region has experienced a 21 percent increase in total precipitation on the heaviest rainfall days since the 1950s. These are no longer theoretical risks; they are lived realities.

Playing the Blame Game

Many politicians and officials have been quick to blame the severity of the flooding on the federal administration’s weakened civil service and cuts to disaster response agencies. It is true that hollowing out of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has left communities less prepared and protected. But we cannot lose sight of the bigger picture.

Don’t let the preparedness debate distract us from the real question: Why do we need this level of preparation in the first place?

Climate change.

In all the chatter about preparing for extreme weather, “climate change” has barely been uttered by federal, state, or local officials from either political party. Indeed, like challenges to preparedness, efforts to raise climate change as a contributing factor have been met with tired accusations of “politicizing a tragedy.” But as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman rightly argues:

“Now is exactly the time to put officials on the spot…if we don’t make an issue of how this happened…nothing will be learned and nothing will change.”

Texas Governor Abbot dismissed the idea of blame, calling it a word for “losers” before pivoting to football metaphors. But unless climate change becomes part of the game plan, Texans — and all Americans — will continue to lose.

It’s All About Climate Change

To ignore the fact that global warming amplified this flood is to invite the next storm — wetter, hotter, and deadlier. Every moment we stay silent about climate change, we sink deeper into a fossil-fueled future defined by disaster.

The Fossil Fuel Industry is Driving Disaster

The science is undeniable. Greenhouse gases are at their highest concentration in at least 800,000 years, and fossil fuels are their primary driver. 2024 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature 1.55°C above the pre-industrial average. The last decade was the warmest ever documented.

Who Pays?

The deadly floods in Texas will cause an estimated $18 billion to $22 billion in damage and economic loss. But it won’t be the fossil fuel companies footing the bill. It will be ordinary Texans‚ families already grieving lost loved ones and livelihoods.

The Insurance Industry Contributes to Climate Change, But Avoids Its Consequences

As the waters recede, many flood victims will discover they won’t be insured for the damage. Standard homeowners’ insurance doesn’t cover flooding. Separate flood insurance, often prohibitively expensive, isn’t always required, and only a fraction of Texans carry it.

Across the21 counties included in Governor Abbott’s disaster declaration, only 10 percent of homeowners carry federal flood insurance. In Kerr County, the worst-hit area where 95 people died, just 2 percent of homeowners hold federal flood insurance. In neighboring Kendall County, it is less than 5 percent.

Homeowners can purchase a separate flood insurance policy from a private insurance provider, but it is expensive, and the coverage is limited. It’s not yet clear how many Texas flood victims held separate private flood insurance as an add-on to their homeowners policy.

The residents facing the greatest climate-related vulnerabilities, including those living in RVs, mobile homes, or informal housing, face even greater risks. Several RV and mobile home parks in Central Texas were swept away by floodwaters, highlighting how those with the fewest resources are often forced to live in the most dangerous places.

And yet, the insurance industry — an industry that invests billions in fossil fuel companies and underwrites fossil fuel projects — continues to fuel the climate crisis while shielding itself from its financial impacts. Insurers raise premiums, limit coverage, or leave disaster-prone areas altogether, but they remain heavily invested in the fossil fuel economy that’s driving these disasters.

The Path Forward: Accountability and Action

The tragic loss of life in Texas was undoubtedly fueled by climate change — and climate change is driven by the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel industry must be held accountable for its contribution to the floods in Texas — and other fossil-fueled climate catastrophes.

Insurance companies must also be called to account. They cannot claim to be managing climate risk while actively financing and underwriting the industries that create it. State insurance regulators should require insurers to divest from fossil fuel companies and stop insuring fossil fuel projects. And responses to the climate-driven insurance crisis should prioritize the needs of residents on the front line of fossil-fueled climate disasters, not insurers’ bottom line.

Extreme weather events will continue to escalate until we confront their root cause. State and local leaders hold the keys to both prevention and recovery. It’s time for them to face reality and protect the people they serve.",https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-11.17.04-AM.png,N,,2025-07-14 15:20:20.911884

“What cleantech company (or companies) from your country/region would you highlight to our international audiences at this time, and why?”

60Hertz (South Korea): Virtual Power Plant Solutions for Distributed Energy Resources

60Hertz offers AI-powered forecasting and orchestration software for distributed energy assets like rooftop solar and energy storage systems. Their platform forms the backbone of “virtual power plants” that stabilize grids with real-time optimization, which is essential as Asia transitions away from centralized fossil power.

As South Korea’s new administration prioritizes grid modernization and clean energy diversification, 60Hertz is at the center of what’s next for regional energy resilience. The government’s initiatives to enhance renewable energy integration and smart grid technologies create a conducive environment for 60Hertz’s solutions.

Internationally, 60Hertz’s platform is crucial for integrating renewable energy sources into existing grids, enhancing stability and efficiency in the global transition to clean energy. Their technology supports the development of resilient and flexible energy systems worldwide.

GridWiz is a South Korea-based energy technology company pioneering virtual power plant (VPP) solutions that intelligently manage distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar, electric vehicle chargers, and battery storage. Leveraging AI-powered demand response and real-time energy orchestration, GridWiz enhances grid reliability while accelerating the transition to renewable energy.

As Korea pushes forward with its energy transition—marked by aggressive renewable targets, EV adoption, and smart grid modernization—GridWiz is positioned at the intersection of policy momentum and technological capability. The company’s Enernet platform serves as a digital bridge connecting end-user energy devices to utilities, enabling bidirectional flexibility critical to the next-generation power system.

The Korean government’s growing emphasis on energy digitalization, carbon neutrality, and VPP demonstration projects has created fertile ground for GridWiz’s expansion. The company has been an active partner in national-scale smart grid pilot zones and is a leading player in demand-side resource aggregation for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and the Korea Power Exchange (KPX).

Internationally, GridWiz is contributing to the global shift toward decentralized, intelligent energy systems. Its AI-enabled solutions are not only optimizing energy use and reducing carbon emissions but also empowering communities and businesses to become prosumers in resilient, climate-resilient power grids.

Gridwiz completed its IPO onto the KOSDAQ exchange in June 2024.

PCG Power (China): Distributed Solar, Storage, and Virtual Power Plant Platforms for Commercial and Industrial Clean Energy

One cleantech company from the Asia region I would highlight is PCG Power, one of China’s largest and fastest-growing developers and operators of distributed renewable energy assets and energy storage in the commercial and industrial sector.

PCG Power is significant for Asia because it provides several important learnings on how renewable energy can be deployed at much higher speed and scale, challenging the traditional developer status quo with a more agile and replicable model. The ability to deploy more quickly and reliably is especially needed in today’s environment where in Asia, grid demand is accelerating with greater electrification, and geopolitical shifts are driving the need for localized energy supply chains.

Ultra-fast deployment at scale: PCG has developed over 2GW of projects so far and achieved almost 1GW connected to the grid within one year. That’s close to 200 projects—compare this to timelines for comparable projects by traditional players which take at least two years from project award to commissioning. This is achievable due to PCG Power’s repeatable, modular deployment model tailored for commercial and industrial versus the traditional one-off build, incorporating digital tools such as drone surveying and automated permitting.

_

Innovative capital model: Compared to capital-heavy, centralized projects that require large upfront financing and are tied to PPAs with long tenors, PCG Power has been able to implement an asset-light structure through SPVs to scale distributed assets with arms-length infrastructure finance partners, enabling higher IRRs than traditional project developers.

_

Digitally native operations from the outset: While traditional projects often underutilize digital infrastructure post-commissioning, PCG Power embeds digitalization throughout the entire lifecycle from site selection to O&M via tools such as its real-time Energy Management System (EMS). These tools enable predictive maintenance, second-level fault diagnosis, and active participation in electricity markets through Virtual Power Plant (VPP) capabilities, allowing PCG Power to maximize IRRs and long-term returns across its portfolio.

On Tuesday afternoon, a meeting, facilitated by Kevin Kelly of Crimson Power, will be held at 1 p.m. in Room 21 of Town Hall. Kelly will offer an explanation of the program, including details surrounding its implementation.

In late November 2024, Athol’s Town Energy Committee recommended that the town move ahead with aggregation, which was approved by voters at a Town Meeting in 2012. The Selectboard didn’t authorize the town manager to work on a plan until May of last year, however.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines municipal power aggregation as a program that allows “local governments to procure power on behalf of their residents, businesses, and municipal accounts from an alternative supplier while still receiving transmission and distribution service from their existing utility provider.”

Aggregation, according to the agency’s website, can “increase the use of green energy beyond that offered by its default utility, and reduce monthly electric bills for the municipality, its residents, and local businesses.”

In Athol’s case, the default utility is National Grid.

“Communities gain leverage to negotiate better rates with competitive suppliers and choose greener power sources,” according to the EPA.

At the Town Energy Committee’s November 2025 meeting, Kelly cited Webster as an example of a community where lower rates had been negotiated under municipal aggregation. In addition, Kelly explained that Webster offers its citizens a 100% green energy option. Nearly all of Webster’s 6,500 electricity consumers, which are mostly all residential – have chosen to “go green.”

Without policy, sharp increases in electricity generation driven by AI could have detrimental effects on public health.

Why it matters: The air pollution produced by fossil fuel-powered electricity generation exacerbates a range of adverse health outcomes, including premature mortality. These effects are most acutely borne by the elderly, the very young, and people with pre-existing health stressors.

Catch up quick: Over the past 10 to 15 years, numerous coal-fired power plants have retired in the U.S. Research shows the result of these plant closures has been major reductions in both air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Financial and insurance markets reveal additional resilience costs associated with GHG emissions and, by extension, continued reliance on fossil fuels to produce electricity.

For example, rising costs from disasters including floods, wildfires, and hurricanes have resulted in dramatic increases in property insurance premiums in high-risk markets. Corporate insurers have also cancelled policies due to changes in the risk distribution. The result of these conditions has been a sharp increase in the risks faced by insured consumers and firms.

The main issue: Given the societal costs associated with high-emitting generation, expanding clean electricity supply to meet data center electricity needs while increasing system efficiency is a central need.

Renewable energy, paired with a modest amount of clean firm electric power and energy storage, is likely to play an important role here.

Incentives that encourage electrification in a manner that is coordinated with generation and transmission investments regionally to avoid imbalances, and system instabilities will be important to steady progress.

The jobs factor: Renewable electricity has also been a significant source of employment in the U.S.

Recent data clearly suggest that the vast majority of new jobs in the electric power generation industries were due to deployment of clean energy technologies.

And the total health benefits that come from retiring coal-fired power plants are many times greater than the lost salaries and wages resulting from the retirements.

Yes, but: Although national trends are encouraging, it is nevertheless essential to recognize and account for regional impacts.

Renewable energy may not always emerge in places where fossil energy is in decline, and those who reap benefits may be different from those who face costs.

In regions where the jobs impacts are most acute, providing targeted support for workers to transition to occupations with adjacent skills and commensurate pay is especially important.

Policy takeaways: Nuclear power, geothermal and electricity produced with renewables like wind and solar coupled with energy storage impose far fewer environmental and social costs than either natural gas or coal. And these sources of clean energy may provide important local economic stimulus and job creation, although targeted efforts to address impacts by region will be essential.",https://live-cmu-main.pantheonsite.io/themes/cmu_base/images/wordmark.png,N,,2025-07-14 19:10:51.238927

Targeted policies to create “AI Fast Lanes” will ensure that the development of new AI and data center infrastructure does not increase costs for consumers, impact the environment, and exacerbate existing energy burdens.

Why it matters: Absent policy action, consumers and the environment could bear the brunt of adding new power generation to the nation’s electricity grid.

Catch up quick: One of the biggest bottlenecks in many regions of the U.S. in adding capacity to the electricity grid is the number of studies that must be completed before connecting. But the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) uses a “connect and manage” interconnection process that results in faster interconnections. A similar nationwide fast lane for connecting to the grid can address the bottleneck felt across the U.S.

What we’re doing: A new “Smart AI Fast Lanes” framework would expand the spirit of the Texas “connect and manage” approach nationwide for data centers and clean energy. This framework also includes investment and innovation prizes to speed up the interconnection process, ensure grid reliability, and lower costs for communities.

Data center providers would work with the Department of Energy, the Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation (FESI), the Department of Commerce, National Laboratories, state energy offices, utilities, and the Department of Defense to speed up interconnection queues, spur innovation in efficiency, and re-invest in infrastructure, to increase energy security and lower costs.

FESI is an independent, nonprofit, agency-related foundation that was created by Congress to help the Department of Energy achieve its mission and accelerate the development and commercialization of critical energy technologies.

FESI leading a Smart AI Fast Lanes initiative could be a force multiplier to enable rapid deployment of clean AI compute capabilities that are good for communities, companies, and national security.

How it works: For any proposed data center investment of more than 250 megawatts, companies could apply to work with FESI.

Successful applications would leverage public, private, and philanthropic funds and technical assistance.

Projects would be required to increase clean energy supplies, achieve world-leading data center energy efficiency, invest in transmission and distribution infrastructure, and/or deploy virtual power plants for grid flexibility.

Policy takeaways: Recommendations to implement the Smart AI Fast Lane initiative include:

Fees to speed connection: New large AI data center loads would pay a fee to connect to the grid without first completing lengthy pre-connection cost studies. Those payments would go into a fund, managed and overseen by FESI, that would be used to cover any infrastructure costs incurred by regional grids for the first three years after project completion.

‘Bring your own power’ prize: FESI could award prize funding for clean electricity generated locally that covers twice as much as the data center uses annually.

Efficiency innovation awards: FESI could award prizes for meeting efficiency targets of how much AI computing work we get for the amount of energy and water used. This would create incentives for both innovation and transparency in efficiency.

Award transmission upgrades: Create prizes for deployment of reconductoring, transmission, or grid enhancing technologies to increase capacity, and prizes to upgrade distribution infrastructure beyond the needs for the project. This will reduce future electricity rate cases, which will keep electricity costs affordable.

Flexibility prizes: Prizes that reward flexibility and end-use efficiency investments, including for:

Data centers that demonstrate best-in-class flexibility through smart controls and operational improvements.

Utilities hosting data centers that reduce summer and winter peak loads in the local service territory.

Utilities that meet home weatherization targets and deploy virtual power plants.

The bottom line: The U.S. is facing the risk of electricity demand outstripping supplies in many parts of the country, which would be severely detrimental to people’s lives, to the economy, to the environment, and to national security. “Smart AI Fast Lanes” and FESI-run prizes will enable U.S. competitiveness in AI, keep energy costs affordable, reduce pollution, and prepare the country for new opportunities.",https://live-cmu-main.pantheonsite.io/themes/cmu_base/images/wordmark.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:17:23.569395

Combining generative AI with reinforcement learning can help the U.S. win the race to fusion energy by finding better ways to reach the plasma temperatures and pressures needed for fusion power plants. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are using these advances in AI to unlock the promise of unlimited, clean energy from fusion.

Why it matters: Consider some of the world's grand challenges: producing enough food, the availability of clean water, or handling climate change. These are all primarily energy problems. We already have the ability to produce and deliver food and water — it’s just energy-intensive, and thus expensive to do so. The biggest contributor to climate change is our inability to generate sufficient energy without unwanted side effects.

Nuclear fusion, the reaction that powers the sun and stars, holds the promise of solving these problems here on Earth.

There is a nearly unlimited supply of fuel, some of which can be derived from seawater.

It does not produce long-term harmful byproducts. Its power plants can not melt down.

The biggest hurdle to delivering on this promise is our inability to sustain the extremely high plasma temperatures and pressures needed for a financially viable power plant. Solving that challenge is where AI comes in.

The big question: The traditional research approach to solving hard scientific and engineering challenges like nuclear fusion centers on individual scientists. It is the single-scientist, single-hypothesis, single-experiment, single-dataset analysis, single conclusion approach to science. That has worked in the past, but it is too slow.

Now, AI algorithms, working alongside scientists, can reason about all the data, all the hypotheses, all the accumulated scientific knowledge, and design experiments at a much faster rate than individual scientists alone. The question we ask is how to design those AI algorithms, and what is the collaborative discovery process that delivers those breakthroughs for nuclear fusion.

Catch up quick: There are two recent developments, and one that is still missing, that enable this new approach to science for nuclear fusion.

Advances in large language models: They now provide that repository of scientific knowledge that previously wasn't very accessible to other AI algorithms.

Advances in reinforcement learning and discovery algorithms: They allow for work at the scale needed for hard problems like nuclear fusion.

Finally, the missing development is the national capacity to generate more data through experiments on our research fusion devices. These devices were built and funded to generate enough data to support the old single-scientist model, which couldn't handle much data anyway. AI can handle more data and needs it to make these big advances.

What we’re doing: With funding from the Department of Energy, the Auton Lab at CMU, a collaboration with the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, and DIII-D at General Atomics, has demonstrated the ability of AI to: do closed loop control of temperature and density profiles; optimize heating profiles for stability, stably reach high pressures, and do so at multiple fusion devices.

Policy takeaways: In order for the U.S. to fully leverage the advances in nuclear fusion made possible with AI, policy makers should reconsider the national capability to run fusion experiments and dramatically expand the operation to run more experiments and thus obtain more data for AI.

In the near term, this means the Department of Energy buying more experiment time on the devices we already have and allocating it to AI-guided data collection.

In the longer term, it means building new devices designed for high throughput experimentation.

The U.S. needs a national AI for Fusion Initiative to support model development, empower the national labs to expand access and develop a lab to manufacturing strategy for devices.",https://live-cmu-main.pantheonsite.io/themes/cmu_base/images/wordmark.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:17:27.035073

Other state leaders, including Armando Quintero, director of California State Parks, shared similar fears.
However, he said he remains optimistic about the state and nation's progress toward clean energy, which he sees as inevitable.
""They can slow the transition to clean energy here and there, but they can't stop it,"" Chun said.
Indeed, state officials said there are ways to push back.","Budget cuts, staff reductions and other sweeping changes from the federal government are posing real threats to California's environment and progress against climate change, state officials said Thursday.

At a gathering of the state's top leaders in wildfire response, water resources, natural lands and clean energy, they underscored the ways the Golden State has long worked together with federal agencies—and how actions by the Trump administration are putting that cooperative work in jeopardy.

""We want federal agencies to succeed, and in fact we need them to succeed,"" said Wade Crowfoot, California's natural resources secretary, noting that 48% of the state's land is owned and managed by the federal government. ""Because if they fail, it impacts the prosperity and safety of Californians.""

State agencies such as the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Task Force, the Department of Water Resources and the Energy Commission are among those struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of federal cutbacks, officials said. The Trump administration has said its changes are geared toward reducing federal waste, saving taxpayers money and increasing American energy independence.

Yet state officials are increasingly worried about shifting national priorities, including a 10% staffing cut at the U.S. Forest Service— the largest federal firefighting entity that often works hand in hand with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to manage forests and combat blazes.

Many of the Forest Service's eliminated employees were in support roles, such as logistics and transportation, that are crucial to ensuring firefighters can do their job, according to Patrick Wright, director of the California Wildfire and Forest Resilience Task Force.

""All that knowledge is going to be lost, which is so critical when we're both fighting fires and trying to prevent fires, so the whole system is going to suffer,"" he said.

Wright noted that the president's proposed 2026 budget would also eliminate many of the Forest Service's top scientists, which he said would negatively affect data systems, analyses and other crucial tools. And although California has made progress in its efforts to improve forest health and reduce wildfire risk through forest thinning, prescribed burns and fuel breaks, Wright said he is concerned about the impacts of the president's order to open up millions of acres of national forestland for timber production, including all 18 of California's national forests.

""Not that timber isn't important, but we can't keep our eye off of the need for fire and forest resilience in California,"" he said. There is ""serious concern by Forest Service people on the ground that if we solely focus on timber, we're going to lose our focus on protecting communities, preventing wildfire, protecting habitat and other key measures of success.""

It's not only wildfires that officials are worried about, however. Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said the agency is reeling from several changes to key components of its water supply system.

Among them are staff reductions at the federal U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees the Central Valley Project—a vast network of dams, reservoirs and canals that delivers water supplies across the state. The Central Valley Project is the federal companion to the State Water Project, which performs a similar function.

This year, the Bureau of Reclamation has lost about 1,400 staff members— or more than a quarter of its workforce—and is facing a potential budget cut of 33%, Nemeth said.

""Because a lot of our infrastructure is operated in a cooperative way, it does have an expanded effect on how our whole system is put together,"" Nemeth said.

The state also works closely with the Bureau of Reclamation to manage flood protection in California, where several levee and dam safety projects are now in jeopardy, Nemeth said. They include projects to enhance the system along the American River in Sacramento—one of the most flood-prone urban areas in the U.S.—and to address the devastating 2023 levee breach that flooded the community of Pajaro.

Other state leaders, including Armando Quintero, director of California State Parks, shared similar fears. He said the National Park Service is facing a potential $1-billion budget cut and has lost 24% of permanent staff since January. More than 100 superintendent positions are vacant. It's resulted in canceled tours, closed campgrounds, reduced hours and other effects in California's nine national parks.

Meanwhile, all 18 of California's national forests are losing staff, and its regional office is likely to be eliminated, he said. The state's roadless areas and national monuments are similarly facing the threat of lost protections and closures.

Jenn Eckerle, deputy secretary for oceans and coastal policy at the California Natural Resources Agency, said the state is facing the loss of funding for coastal protection, including about $870 million previously awarded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Building Resilience Infrastructure and Communities grant program, which has been canceled.

One such project was an $18-million BRIC grant to help the city of Imperial Beach protect infrastructure, habitat and coastal access from sea level rise through a nature-based levee, Eckerle said.

""Obviously, these actions are going to hamper California's ability to predict, respond and adapt to climate impacts like sea level rise, ocean acidification, marine heat waves, and will lead to impacts on our coastal economies and ecosystems,"" she said.

Perhaps one of the biggest areas to suffer is California's ambitious push for clean energy. The state has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 throughout its economy and has been a nationwide leader in the move toward solar and wind power and electric vehicles.

Robert Chun, chief of staff to the chair of the California Energy Commission, said the Trump administration has made moves to end long-standing tax credits for clean energy. They will apply only to projects placed into service by December 2027, or that start construction by July 2026.

The administration is also canceling $3.7 billion in awards managed by the Department of Energy's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations—at least $800 million of which was supposed to go to California, Chun said. That office's staff has been reduced from about 250 people to 35, he said.

He added that the Trump administration has removed basic energy efficiency regulations that have existed for decades, and has made it harder for California to reduce pollution by revoking waivers it is granted under the Clean Air Act to enforce tailpipe emission standards.

Chun said the result of these changes is likely to be worse air quality, higher energy costs, reduced grid reliability and limited growth for new industries such as artificial intelligence. However, he said he remains optimistic about the state and nation's progress toward clean energy, which he sees as inevitable.

""They can slow the transition to clean energy here and there, but they can't stop it,"" Chun said. ""We shouldn't back down from our vision of a clean energy future, or lower our expectations of what we can achieve here in California.""

Indeed, state officials said there are ways to push back. California is party to several lawsuits against the Trump administration, including one challenging its attempt to overturn the state's clean air waivers. The state is also working to hire laid-off federal employees, particularly those who were working on crucial projects.

Last month, conservation groups across the state and country also came together to push back against a GOP-led proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands in Western states, which would have made about 10 million acres in California eligible for sale. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who spearheaded the effort, ultimately nixed the proposal.

""California remains committed and focused on our priorities and our values,"" said Crowfoot, the state's natural resources secretary. He encouraged residents to stay informed, voice their concerns to public officials and work to build broad-based bipartisan coalitions to amplify shared priorities when it comes to the state's environment.

""What we're talking about today,"" he said, ""are things that we all care about.""

The assumed delayed deployment in the Deviated NECP scenario has far-reaching implications.","Greece’s ambitious National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) outlines a comprehensive roadmap to decarbonize its energy system by 2050. Central to this vision is the decarbonization of the power sectors which includes a balanced deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) – notably solar photovoltaic (PV), onshore and offshore wind – and a robust expansion of electricity storage to manage variability and provide flexibility.

However, an in-depth analysis of the current market trends reveals growing signals that actual investment may diverge from the NECP’s optimal trajectory. Ricardo’s Electricity Market Outlook’s latest quarterly report deep dives into this divergence and, specifically, identifies two critical risks: an accelerating overinvestment in solar PV without corresponding storage capacity, and significant delays in offshore wind development. These issues could make the energy transition more expensive, less reliable, and slower than intended. Such uncoordinated investment pathways may affect anticipated revenues of different market revenues greatly.

The Central NECP scenario: a delicate balance

The deviated NECP scenario: a growing mismatch

The Deviated NECP scenario explores the possible divergence of investment strategies from the optimal configuration presented in the official NECP, and paints a more troubling picture. It projects that solar PV investments can exceed NECP targets by up to 37% by 2030, while storage capacity will be 54% lower. Offshore wind development is also delayed, reaching the 2030 target only by 2034. These deviations, though hypothetical, are grounded in observable market trends: solar PV continues to attract investment due to declining technology costs, while storage and offshore wind face financial, regulatory, and logistical hurdles.

Consequences of the solar-storage imbalance

The most immediate impact of the solar-storage mismatch that our Deviated NECP scenario presents is a sharp increase in curtailment. Without sufficient storage to absorb midday solar surpluses, curtailment rates for solar PV rise to 10-18%, compared to just 5% under the Central NECP. This not only wastes clean energy but also erodes the financial viability of solar projects. Capture prices for solar PV – i.e., the average revenue per MWh generated – drop by up to 50% by 2030, making it difficult for investors to recover capital costs through wholesale market revenues alone.

Moreover, the lack of storage exacerbates price volatility. Daytime prices plummet due to oversupply, while evening prices spike as gas plants ramp up to meet demand. This widening price spread benefits existing storage operators, who can profit from arbitrage, but it introduces uncertainty for all market participants and increases reserve costs. Reserve-up prices rise by 30-40% and reserve-down prices by 35-45% until 2030, reflecting the system’s growing need for flexibility.

Offshore wind delays: a missed opportunity

Offshore wind, with its high-capacity factors and complementary generation profile to solar, is a cornerstone of the NECP’s long-term strategy. The assumed delayed deployment in the Deviated NECP scenario has far-reaching implications. Between 2031 and 2034, the shortfall in offshore wind leads to a 30% increase in carbon emissions and a 20% rise in electricity costs compared to the Central NECP. Gas-fired generation fills the gap, driving up market prices and emissions at a time when Greece is trying to meet its climate targets.

The delay temporarily boosts the financial performance of gas plants and existing storage assets, which benefit from scarcity rents. However, this comes at the expense of consumers, who face higher electricity bills, and the environment, which bears the brunt of increased fossil fuel use.

Financial implications for investors

The financial analysis of the Deviated NCEP scenario highlights the uneven impact of these deviations across technologies. Solar PV sees its internal rate of return (IRR) drop to near zero, rendering it unviable when financed through wholesale markets without policy support. In contrast, wind energy – both onshore and offshore – proves more resilient, demonstrating a modest enhancement in their IRR leading up to 2040, and benefiting from elevated market prices and their uniform generation profiles.

Conclusion

Greece’s energy transition is at a critical juncture. While the NECP provides a sound roadmap, real-world investment trends are diverging in ways that could undermine its success. By examining those trends and their projected implications, and comparing them to the Central NECP target achievement scenario, the latest Electricity Market Report highlights the urgent need to rebalance the deployment of solar PV, storage, and offshore wind to maintain system stability, economic efficiency, and climate ambition. Without coordinated investment, impacts will vary – some actors may benefit from market shifts, while others could face significant challenges. Without timely intervention, the costs of inaction – both financial and environmental – could be substantial.

The Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee will meet Tuesday to mark up the bill as lawmakers race to fund the government before the Sept. 30 deadline. Congress did not pass final appropriations bills last year, instead leaning on continuing resolutions.

“As Congress works to rein in unnecessary spending and restore fiscal responsibility, the House Appropriations Committee remains committed to ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and efficiently,” Interior and Environment Chair Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) said in a statement.

“The Fiscal Year 2026 Interior and Environment Appropriations Act does just that by right-sizing federal agencies, promoting domestic energy and mineral production, and reversing harmful Biden-era policies.”

Democrats, however, pounced on the bill’s cuts for EPA and Interior, suggesting that a bipartisan agreement is still a long way away.

“House Republicans are once again pushing an agenda that accelerates the climate crisis, upends our National Parks system, and leaves local communities to fend for themselves — all while undermining the power of the Appropriations Committee and of Congress,” Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), the subcommittee ranking member, said in a statement.

“Instead of correcting course, the bill released today delivers more of the same: it cuts water infrastructure funding, slashes EPA programs, and wipes out environmental justice and climate initiatives.”

The bill contains troves of policy riders, mostly aimed at rolling back Biden-era environmental actions and blocking funding for culture war issues like diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental justice.

Interior bureaus slashed

The individual Interior Department bureaus would get less than their current funding levels but more than the Trump administration budget proposal called for.

The House bill’s $1.6 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service, for instance, is $109 million below the fiscal 2025 enacted level but $430 million above President Donald Trump’s budget request.

In a similar vein, the $3.1 billion proposed for the National Park Service is $213 million below the fiscal 2025 level but $1 billion above Trump’s request.

In a few cases, the bill would save programs that the White House sought to kill. The legislation, for instance, offers a $5 million lifeline to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a cut from previous years but not the elimination Trump wants.

The Republican-authored House bill targets a number of familiar Democratic priorities, including one dear to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The bill would eliminate $90 million in National Park Service funding allocated this year for the Presidio Trust in Pelosi’s hometown of San Francisco.

The bill also includes myriad familiar policy riders, including a ban on listing the greater sage grouse as well as a handful of Texas freshwater mussels under the Endangered Species Act. The Fish and Wildlife Service would be required to reissue a rule delisting the gray wolf.

The FWS would be blocked from implementing prior decisions that listed the northern long-eared bat as endangered and the wolverine as threatened, and the agency would be stopped from reintroducing grizzly bears into the North Cascades region of Washington state.

“House Republicans are once again waging war on America’s wildlife in yet another giveaway to their industry allies,” said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity.

The bill also ventures into broader culture-related areas. It prohibits funding for “diversity, equity, and inclusion training or implementation” as well as anything that “promotes or advances Critical Race Theory or any concept associated with Critical Race Theory.” The legislation does not provide a definition of critical race theory.

The bill would prohibit the use of National Park Service funds to “provide housing to an alien without lawful status.” It would also prohibit spending money on the controversial 1,200-megawatt Lava Ridge Wind Project proposed for Bureau of Land Management property in Idaho pending further Interior Department review.

EPA downsizing

The House spending bill would slice deep into EPA’s budget, although not as much as the White House’s proposed cuts for the agency.

EPA would receive roughly $7 billion from the legislation in fiscal 2026, about a $2.1 billion or 23 percent decrease from its enacted funding this year.

Trump planned more dramatic downsizing for the agency as part of his fiscal blueprint, slating $4.2 billion for EPA, which would cut more than half of its annual budget.

The agency is already becoming much smaller during the second Trump administration. Hundreds of employees are leaving EPA, taking the president’s “deferred resignation” offer, while those who remain brace for an expected reduction in force, otherwise known as layoffs.

EPA’s support of state environmental regulators would take a hit under the bill. The agency’s State and Tribal Assistance Grants would be marked at $3.7 billion, a $679.8 million or 15.5 percent cut from fiscal 2025 levels.

That sum includes $2.1 billion for the agency’s Clean Water and Drinking Water state revolving funds, which Trump proposed to eliminate almost in their entirety in his plan. That is still $662 million below current levels, Democratic lawmakers noted in their bill summary.

House Republicans have other cuts for EPA programs. Their legislation would provide $2.27 billion for the agency’s Environmental and Programs Management account, which would be a $922.9 million cut.

The bill would mirror the White House’s budget request for Superfund, EPA’s program for cleaning up contaminated sites, at nearly $283 million. It’s roughly half of the $538 million Superfund received from appropriations last fiscal year, but $1.6 billion in revenue available from reinstated industry taxes is expected to keep the program’s funding at roughly the same level.

The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board would also continue operations with an $8.2 million budget. It’s a $6.2 million cut from last year but would keep it alive despite the Office of Management and Budget’s request to cancel the small investigatory agency.

House appropriators did rebuff the White House’s call to zero out the popular Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program, which hands out money to retool or replace school buses and other diesel-fueled equipment with newer, lower-polluting alternatives.

Instead, the program would get the same $90 million that it’s receiving this year. Targeted Airshed grants, aimed at helping areas address smog or soot pollution, would similarly be level-funded at $67.8 million.

The bill also features a string of policy riders intended to halt implementation of major Biden-era Clean Air Act rules, all of which the Trump administration intends to revisit or repeal.

Those include stronger tailpipe regulations on cars and trucks; greenhouse gas emission requirements for many fossil fuel power plants; a stronger annual limit on airborne soot exposure; and the latest “good neighbor” plan intended to limit smog-forming pollution that crosses state lines.

Other EPA rules are targeted as well. The legislation would bar funds for implementing the agency’s draft risk assessment on using PFOA and PFOS “forever chemicals” in sewage sludge fertilizer as well as enforcing a Biden administration regulation for stopping water pollution under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

The Senate has yet to release its Interior-EPA bill but is proceeding with fiscal 2026 bills on a bipartisan basis, setting up a clash between the chambers and the White House. Congress is all but certain to need a stopgap funding bill to prevent a shutdown.

Volvo is also struggling to attract EV buyers in the highly competitive Chinese market, despite its access to the Geely ecosystem.

Volvo said its upcoming EX60 SUV, set to start production next year, will deliver “significant cost reductions and performance improvements.” The EX90 has struggled with software-related delays that have raised the model’s development costs.

Chief Executive Officer Hakan Samuelsson, who was brought back in April, is pushing through a sweeping $1.9 billion efficiency program after Volvo suffered a 60% plunge in first-quarter operating income. The automaker is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Depetris, Arick Wierson, Daoud Kuttab, Jesse Edwards, Josh Hammer",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-undoing-climate-action-can-clean-energy-investments-survive-2098780,"These are certainly interesting times for those in the clean tech and climate solutions sectors.
""We are seeing signs of a coming pull back from other venture capital firms in clean tech,"" Wolfson said.
Her advice to clean tech companies: ""Hunker down, do the work, build the solutions, and be ready,"" she said.
Despite political headwinds, he said, market forces are working in favor of clean energy.
""And during his entire first term, renewable deployment was never higher, EV deployment was never higher, corporate commitment to clean energy was never higher.","You've probably heard of the old curse that goes, ""May you live in interesting times."" These are certainly interesting times for those in the clean tech and climate solutions sectors.

With the passage of his ""big beautiful"" bill this month, President Donald Trump has eliminated many of the federal government incentives that had triggered hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in clean energy, batteries, EVs and other climate solutions over the past three years.

The Trump administration has pulled the U.S. out of international climate agreements and scrapped regulations on emissions from autos and the power sector in an attempt to steer the energy economy back to reliance on fossil fuels.

But the whiplash-inducing U-turn on energy policy in the U.S. is starkly at odds with signals from the broader energy market. In the U.S., renewable energy now accounts for about 90 percent of the new electricity capacity being added to the grid as wind, solar and batteries have become the cheapest and fastest sources of new power.

Globally, the International Energy Agency reported that the capital flowing into low-carbon energy sources this year is roughly twice that going into fossil fuel development, raising the specter that the U.S. is turning its back on one of the world's fastest-growing new industries.

Add to all that the impacts of tariffs and trade wars, and you have a period of unparalleled uncertainty for clean tech companies and the investors who back them. Interesting times indeed.

Better Planet asked some leading clean tech and climate solutions investors how they are making sense of this shifting landscape and what they see ahead for a series we're calling ""Climate Investing in a Volatile Climate.""

In this first installment, we'll hear from Johanna Wolfson, co-founder and general partner at Azolla Ventures, a climate-focused venture capital fund, and Peter Davidson, founder and CEO at Aligned Climate Capital, an asset management company focused on companies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Both Wolfson and Davidson told Newsweek that Trump's sudden policy shifts on energy will slow, but not stop investment, and both predicted that the strong economic arguments for clean tech will still attract capital.

""We are seeing signs of a coming pull back from other venture capital firms in clean tech,"" Wolfson said. Climate investing won't dry up altogether, she said, but newer companies and emerging technologies with higher risk will likely find it harder to attract capital. Her advice to clean tech companies: ""Hunker down, do the work, build the solutions, and be ready,"" she said.

Davidson said that even before the Republican-led Congress voted to phase out clean energy tax credits, the atmosphere of uncertainty was already causing companies to cancel or scale back some announced projects.

""You can get depressed about that or you can continue the fight,"" Davidson said. Despite political headwinds, he said, market forces are working in favor of clean energy.

""It's gotten complicated because you have to avoid things that are reliant on federal tax policy,"" Davidson said. ""But there are plenty of companies out there, many projects out there, that we think are still highly investable and can earn a very good return.""

'It's a Big World' for Climate Investors

Wolfson described Azolla Ventures as a ""catalytic capital"" firm that invests in early-stage climate technologies, using capital sourced mainly from tax-exempt foundations and donor-advised funds. This allows Azolla to prioritize positive climate impact when deciding what companies to back.

""We're taking on outsized risk and maybe doing that at an earlier time or in a different way than even other climate-oriented venture funds might be willing,"" she said. ""We're looking for giga-scale impact.""

One budding success story, she said, is the low-carbon cement company Sublime Systems. Azolla was an early backer, and Sublime recently signed a deal with Microsoft that is the largest procurement deal for clean cement to date.

Azolla's approach also assumes a long lead time for nascent clean technologies to develop, she explained, a mindset that is less susceptible to shifting political winds.

""When we're evaluating companies for investment, we're looking at market growth and emissions avoided out to 2050,"" Wolfson said. ""That's a lot longer than a four-year administration.""

Wolfson said some clean energy sources are still well-positioned to benefit under Trump policy, such as new nuclear technology and geothermal energy, which she expects to grow rapidly as major tech companies race to procure steady power for AI data centers.

However, she said that as U.S. leadership retreats from climate action, much of the rest of the world is moving ahead, and investment dollars are likely to follow.

""It's a big world,"" Wolfson said. Some companies Azolla works with are now looking to pilot new projects outside of the U.S., and her firm is supporting them to integrate into other markets. ""We should go to where the early adopters are, and if that continues to shift, then those companies should shift with it.""

Overall, Wolfson said, she is ""deeply concerned"" about the lack of global progress on climate goals. That makes Azolla more interested in early-stage support for ""big swing"" technologies that have potential for large-scale emissions cuts.

""They're going to have to shoulder more of the emissions avoided since we're not keeping track with the desired reduction,"" she said. Azolla is also looking at more investment in adaptation and resilience solutions to help society better deal with climate change impacts that are happening now.

""They're going to accelerate,"" she said of climate-driven extreme weather events. ""We've essentially baked that in.""

An Energy Policy 'Reckoning is Coming'

Before launching Aligned Climate Capital, Peter Davidson had worked on funding energy projects in the Department of Energy (DOE), where he directed the DOE's Loan Programs Office under President Barack Obama and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.

That long history with the public and private sectors informs his view of what Trump 2.0 means for clean tech investment.

""We've seen this movie before, because we were in this business during Trump One,"" Davidson said. ""And during his entire first term, renewable deployment was never higher, EV deployment was never higher, corporate commitment to clean energy was never higher. So, we see the same things happening here.""

Aligned's most recent round of funding concluded in March with $85 million, double the previous round and higher than the company's target, Davidson said. The company's main focus is investing in proven technologies that can rapidly scale, and supporting construction of distributed power generation such as community and mid-sized solar projects—what Davidson called the ""quiet workhorse"" of the clean energy transition.

""They're big enough for meaningful impact, but you avoid the red tape of utility-scale development,"" he said.

Recent data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) shows that even amid the Trump administration's assault on climate action, solar (often paired with battery storage) remains the favored way to add power as electricity demand rises.

In the first four months of this year, FERC data showed, solar accounted for 78 percent of new capacity. Looking ahead, FERC expects about 90 gigawatts of new solar to come online in the coming three years, compared to only 19 gigawatts of new gas-fired power. Coal-fired power is expected to drop further with the retirements of several older facilities.

""The energy transition is underway and it's unstoppable,"" Davidson said. Even with the reduced tax credits, he argued, solar generation is still cheaper to build than natural gas, and supply chain backlogs for gas turbines mean many gas projects will likely be delayed.

""So, anything that's going to be built in the United States over the next five years is what we're doing, mid-size, or the large, utility scale, wind and solar,"" Davidson said.

However, renewable energy will not grow as fast as it would have with continued tax credits and other government support. The existing fleet of natural gas power plants will be taking up a lot of the coming demand for electricity at the same time that the Trump administration is promoting more exports of liquified natural gas. That points to a nearly inevitable rise in energy prices, Davidson said.

Most independent analyses of the ""big beautiful"" budget bill Trump signed on July 4 show sharp increases in energy costs. Analysts at Rhodium Group estimate the law will increase national average household energy bills by at least $78 and as much as $192 while forcing total industrial energy expenditures up by at least $7 billion. (Industrial energy costs also tend to get passed along to consumers via higher prices for goods and services.)

Davidson predicted that rising energy prices will bring a political backlash.

""Eventually there'll be a correction at the polls,"" he said. ""We believe a reckoning is coming, and when that happens, it will bring a little more sense and sensibility into our energy policy.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2678810/better-planet.png,N,,2025-07-14 14:31:38.638159

Gavin Newsom (D) announced Monday, noting that fossil fuel alternatives were the only energy sources used “nearly every day this year for some part of the day.”

“As the federal government turns its back on innovation and commonsense, California is making our clean energy future a reality,” Newsom said in a statement. “The world’s fourth largest economy is running on two-thirds clean power — the largest economy on the planet to achieve this milestone.”

“Not since the Industrial Revolution have we seen this kind of rapid transformation,” he added.

The governor’s office noted in its news release that the most recent figures, which show 67 percent of the state’s power coming from clean sources, are from 2023 and the state has made additional efforts since then. California approved a state law in 2018 that requires the state to move to 100 percent renewable, carbon-free power sources by 2045.

But the state’s power milestone comes amid federal pushback on programs meant to encourage transitions to renewable energy sources.

The massive tax and spending overhaul, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that President Trump signed earlier this month cuts back green energy subsidies that Democrats had embraced during the Biden administration.

Trump signed an executive order days after signing the law, blasting “expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar” and directing top Cabinet officials to review subsidies that have been given to promote those efforts.

“Reliance on so-called ‘green’ subsidies threatens national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries,” the president wrote. “Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/647019ac03e9c7.62068017.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-14 15:19:12.221458

WKHS

) (“Workhorse” or the “Company”)

, an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, today disclosed it is currently in discussions with a privately held U.S.-based manufacturer of electric commercial vehicles regarding a potential transaction.

The Company is currently in discussions with a privately held U.S.-based manufacturer of electric commercial vehicles (the “Manufacturer”) about a potential transaction in which the Manufacturer would be merged into a newly created subsidiary of the Company in exchange for newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Potential Transaction”). Although the number of shares to be issued has not yet been determined, the Company currently expects that the Potential Transaction would result in the current investors of the Manufacturer holding a substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock following consummation of the Potential Transaction. Subject to compliance with Nasdaq’s listing procedures and approval by Nasdaq, the Company and the Manufacturer currently intend that the Company’s common stock would remain listed on Nasdaq following consummation of the Potential Transaction.

The Potential Transaction also contemplates a refinancing of the Company’s outstanding senior secured convertible notes (the “Notes”) and cancellation of the related warrants (the “Warrants”) issued to an institutional investor in the Notes and Warrants (the “Investor”) with the proceeds of a new convertible note and an approximately $20 million sale leaseback of the Company’s Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility (the “Potential Sale-Leaseback”), each to be provided by entities affiliated with the current holder of a majority of the equity interests of the Manufacturer (the “Potential Refinancing”). Based on its current discussions with the Investor and the Manufacturer, it is anticipated that in the connection with the Potential Refinancing: (i) the Company would repay its outstanding obligations under the Notes in full, but it would not be required to pay a redemption premium or other premium or penalty; (ii) the Investor’s right to require the Company to issue additional Notes under the related Note Purchase Agreement would be terminated; (iii) all the outstanding Warrants would be cancelled; and (iv) as consideration for the foregoing, the Company would issue the Investor three million shares of newly issued common stock, which may be subject to further adjustment (the “New Investor Shares”) at the closing of the Potential Transaction, a portion of which would be subject to contractual trading restrictions (collectively, the “Potential Investor Retirement”).

The Company currently intends that the Potential Refinancing, including the consummation of the Potential Sale-Leaseback, if such transactions are executed, would be completed simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the execution of a definitive agreement for the Potential Transaction (the “Potential Execution Date”). The parties currently are contemplating that (i) the Company would repay approximately half of its then-outstanding obligations under the Notes and cancel the Warrants simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the execution of a definitive agreement for the Potential Transaction and (ii) it would repay all its remaining obligations under the Notes and issue the New Investor Shares upon consummation of the Potential Transaction. Between the Potential Execution Date and the consummation of the Potential Transaction, the Investor would be permitted to convert the remaining Notes into the Company’s common stock in accordance with their terms and to release to the Company cash collateral securing the Notes in connection with certain conversions or otherwise at the Investor’s discretion. As of July 10, 2025, the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Notes were approximately $33 million. However, this number would be reduced to the extent the Investor converts Notes.

The Company has entered into these discussions after exploring and considering a number of available alternatives with its investment banks and other advisors. The Company, the Manufacturer, and the Investor have not agreed to the final terms of the Potential Transaction, the Potential Refinancing or the Potential Investor Retirement, and they have not entered into any definitive agreements with respect to either. There can be no assurance that the potential parties will ever reach agreement on terms or enter into such agreements and no party is under any obligation to do so. In addition, if the potential parties do enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Potential Transaction, the Potential Refinancing and the Potential Investor Retirement, the Company expects that consummation of the Potential Transaction, the Potential Refinancing and the Potential Investor Retirement would be subject to a number of conditions, including approval by the Company’s stockholders and Nasdaq, and other customary conditions, which would be out of the Company’s control and may never be satisfied. Accordingly, the Potential Transaction, the Potential Refinancing and the Potential Investor Retirement may never be consummated or may be consummated on terms materially different from the terms described above. In connection with the foregoing, on July 14, 2025, the Company entered into an Exclusivity Agreement with the Manufacturer providing that, for a period of 14 calendar days and subject to a customary “fiduciary out”, the Company will not, among other things, provide information to, negotiate with or enter into a definitive agreement with a third party for an alternative transaction to the Potential Transaction.

The designation makes the site eligible for funding through the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, more commonly known as Superfund.
""For nearly the past two years, I’ve listened to the community’s concerns and visited Washington, D.C. twice to keep the Carlisle Village Cleaners site on the EPA’s radar.
“Our communities deserve clean air, clean water, and a safe environment,” stated U.S. Representative Melanie Stansbury.
“That is why the EPA’s addition of the Carlisle Village Cleaners site to the National Priorities List is so crucial.","ALBUQUERQUE, NM – The Environmental Protection Agency announced the addition of the Carlisle Village Cleaners site to their Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) . The NPL is a list of known sites where historic releases of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants pose significant threats to human health and the environment. The designation makes the site eligible for funding through the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, more commonly known as Superfund.

""This site has been an environmental threat to the people who live in this area for generations,"" said District 6 City Councilor Nichole L. Rogers. ""For nearly the past two years, I’ve listened to the community’s concerns and visited Washington, D.C. twice to keep the Carlisle Village Cleaners site on the EPA’s radar. It was the residents' commitment throughout the public comment process that ultimately brought an end to decades of exposure. The NPL funding for the remediation and clean-up of the contaminated areas offers the City the opportunity to build a safer environment and revive economic opportunity for future generations in this historic community.""

The site is located at 3611 Simms Ave. SE within City Council District 6 and contains a chlorinated solvent soil gas plume that is centered at two former dry cleaner facilities once located within a small strip mall. Together, the former dry cleaners operated from 1953 to 2017. EPA testing confirmed the presence of contaminants in homes, churches, and commercial structures in the area. Up to 257 individuals may be impacted by the contamination.

""One of the major reasons I fought hard to pass the Infrastructure Law was to drive economic development by investing in EPA’s Superfund cleanup work,"" said Senator Martin Heinrich. ""Now that the former Carlisle Village Cleaners site has been added to the Superfund National Priorities List, we can begin to properly monitor and clean up this site as quickly as possible, protecting the health and safety of local residents, and spurring economic growth for the future.""

In a July 2, 2025 letter to City Mayor Tim Keller, the EPA Superfund Acting Director Monica Smith states that the site’s inclusion on the NPL is the first formal step in the process of getting the site restored to a beneficial use. The agency will notify the City within three months to explain the next steps in the process towards the site’s restoration.

“Our communities deserve clean air, clean water, and a safe environment,” stated U.S. Representative Melanie Stansbury. “That is why the EPA’s addition of the Carlisle Village Cleaners site to the National Priorities List is so crucial. Hundreds of members of our community and dozens of homes are potentially impacted, and we’re grateful for efforts to expedite the cleanup of this site.”

Now that the site is added to the NPL, the EPA will determine if the potential responsible parties will assess site contamination or whether the assessment is to be conducted with federal funds. The EPA assessment will also determine if a quick response to prevent releases from the site is needed within three months after Listing.

""Programs like Superfund ensure that environmental hazards are cleaned up and communities are protected,” remarked Camilla Feibelman, Director of the Sierra Club’s Rio Grande Chapter. “I live less than a mile from the dry cleaner spill and am so relieved to know that my neighbors have a solution at hand. And it reminds us how important it is to support governmental programs like this and ensure the funding is available. This last session our legislators designated $20 million in funding to clean up neglected spill sites like this one, but it's not enough to clean up all the sites statewide. There is certainly more to do, but this is a great start for our corner of Albuquerque.""",https://www.cabq.gov/council/find-your-councilor/district-6/news/old-carlisle-village-cleaners-site-qualifies-for-epas-priority-funding/%40%40download/image/D6CarlisleCleanersSiteadd.png,N,,2025-07-14 15:19:39.387196

This situation prompts EV enthusiasts to monitor Rivian’s upcoming earnings for clarity on adapting to the post-tax-credit landscape.","Rivian Automotive shares fell sharply on Monday following a downgrade from Guggenheim, as analysts cited mounting challenges from recent policy changes under President Trump that scrap key incentives for electric vehicle buyers. This development raises questions about affordability for EV enthusiasts eyeing Rivian’s lineup, potentially slowing adoption in a competitive market. According to a Barron’s report, the stock dropped 2.9% to $12.66 amid broader headwinds for U.S. EV makers.

Policy Shifts Create Headwinds for EV Sales

The downgrade highlights immediate risks from the “OBBB,” or President Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill, recently passed into law. This act eliminates EV purchase tax credits worth up to $7,500 for qualifying vehicles starting in September. Losing this incentive will make it harder to sell more EVs, as buyers face higher upfront costs without the federal support that has boosted demand.

Building on that, emission policy changes add another layer of uncertainty. Congress is now challenging California’s authority to regulate air emissions, which underpins Rivian’s sales of zero-emission vehicle credits. These credits have been a revenue stream for the company, and any disruption could strain finances further. Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow noted in his report that these factors “introduce fundamental and narrative risks” to Rivian’s growth story.

Rivian’s Sales Outlook Dims Amid R1 Challenges

Rivian has already grappled with softening demand for its first-generation R1 family, including the R1S SUV and R1T pickup. The company plans to deliver about 43,000 of these vehicles in 2025, down from nearly 52,000 sold in 2024. This decline reflects broader struggles in the EV sector, where economic pressures and policy reversals curb consumer interest.

Looking ahead, Rivian aims to launch more affordable R2 and R3 models in 2026 to expand its reach.

However, Jewsikow adjusted his projections downward, stating, “Net/net, we now project 150,000 [sales] units in 2028 versus 185,000 prior.”

This figure falls well short of Wall Street’s consensus of 282,000 vehicles for that year, according to FactSet data. Mass-market automakers typically need around 400,000 annual sales to achieve positive operating income, given similar margins between EVs and conventional cars. Without hitting that threshold, Rivian may delay profitability, affecting its ability to invest in innovations like enhanced battery tech or autonomous features that appeal to enthusiasts.

Analyst Sentiment Reflects Cautious Outlook

Jewsikow downgraded Rivian to Hold from Buy and lowered his price target to $16, signaling tempered expectations for the stock’s near-term performance. Overall, only 26% of analysts covering Rivian rate it a Buy, per FactSet—far below the S&P 500 average of about 55%. The average price target sits just under $15, suggesting limited upside from current levels.

Rivian shares have declined about 2% year to date and 28% over the past 12 months, underperforming amid these pressures. For EV owners and potential buyers, this underscores operational implications: slower production ramps could mean longer wait times for new models, while economic factors like reduced incentives might push some toward hybrid alternatives. Regulatory shifts also highlight trends in the industry, where U.S. policy volatility contrasts with steadier support in markets like Europe or China.

This situation prompts EV enthusiasts to monitor Rivian’s upcoming earnings for clarity on adapting to the post-tax-credit landscape. As the company navigates these challenges, its focus on cost efficiencies and product diversification will be key to sustaining momentum in a shifting regulatory environment.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:27:12.763264

In 2023, 67% of its electricity came from renewable or zero‑carbon sources. That’s a leap forward, showing that building a green future works.

Sanctioned by Numbers: Clean Energy Milestone

According to the California Energy Commission (CEC), in 2023:

67% of retail electricity sales came from clean or zero‑carbon power.

This is up from 61% in 2022 and just 41% a decade ago.

This impressive rise clearly shows how fast California’s power mix is changing.

Record‑Breaking Capacity Additions

In 2024, California added a record‑breaking 7,000 MW of clean power to the grid—its biggest one‑year increase ever. That topped the gains in 2022 and 2023. Since 2020, the state has introduced a staggering 25,000 MW of renewables and storage.

Massive Battery Build‑Out

Battery storage capacity has soared from 770 MW in 2019 to over 15,700 MW by early 2025—a growth of nearly 1,900%.

Batteries now:

Store excess solar power by day

Release energy during peak evening hours

Cover roughly 20% of California’s peak power needs.

The state aims to reach 48,000 MW of storage, including 4,000 MW of long‑duration systems by 2045.

Solar Leads the Way

California is the top solar state in the U.S.:

Type Capacity (MW) Utility‑scale solar ~22,200 MW Small-scale (rooftop) ~18,000–19,000 MW

Solar made up about 19% of total in‑state electricity in 2024. Including rooftop solar, that number rises to 32%. In May 2024, solar generation hit a peak of 21,500 MW.

Wind, Hydro, Biomass & Geothermal

Other clean sources also play a key role:

Wind: ~6,400 MW installed; ~6% of in‑state generation

Large Hydropower: ~12% of the mix.

Nuclear: ~12% of the mix.

Biomass & Geothermal: The combined share is small but growing.

Clean Power Days Increase

In 2025 so far:

9 out of 10 days had at least some hours of 100% clean energy.

The grid averaged 7 hours per day running fully clean.

About 52 clean‑energy days so far—nearly 30% of the year—up 750% since 2022.

Emissions Down, Economy Up

Since 2000:

Greenhouse gas emissions dropped 20%.

California’s GDP grew by 78%.

Emissions from power fell by 50% since 2009.

That shows a clean energy economy can thrive.

Clean Energy Job Explosion

California has over 500,000 green jobs. Figures show:

Solar & wind sectors are the largest employers.

Battery storage and grid modernization are the fastest growing.

Clean jobs outnumber fossil‑fuel jobs by 7 to 1.

According to NREL, job estimates for solar, wind, batteries, and efficiency in California rise significantly by 2030.

Major New Projects

Big investments are in the works. Notably:

The Darden Clean Energy Project in western Fresno County –}}

1.1 GW solar + 4.6 GW battery planned

Will power 850,000 homes for 4 hours

Fast-tracked and expected online by 2027–28

~1,200 new jobs; reuse of 9,500 acres of retired farmland

Comparison: California vs U.S. Average

Officials React

CEC Chair David Hochschild said, “California shows clean energy is mainstream and here to stay.”

PUC President Alice Reynolds added, “We bring renewables online at an unprecedented scale and pace.”

What Lies Ahead

California aims for 100% clean electricity by 2045. Goals include:

148,000 MW of new clean capacity by 2045 (solar, wind, batteries)

48,000 MW of total battery storage

EV Volumes predicts it will take until 2043 for more than half of the global fleet to be electric.
Meeting the required lower CO2 emissions targets and circularity requirements mandated by the European Commission will necessitate a major increase in EV sales.
This total would translate to an EV sales growth of 49.5% year on year, even higher than the 34.2% increase recorded in 2024.
This means the region’s EV market generally lags the global adoption curve by about five years.","US tariff uncertainty remains, conflicts continue, and economic headwinds prevail. These are just some of the factors affecting global light-vehicle sales outlooks. But how will they impact electric vehicle (EV) figures? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, reviews his projections with Autovista24 journalist Tom Hooker.

The global light-vehicle market, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCV), is forecast to improve by a modest 1.1% in 2025. EV Volumes expects over 90.15 million units to be registered this year.

This is down from its previous 1.2% growth prediction made in an interim report in April. The figure is also a 0.7 percentage point (pp) drop from its March forecast. This equates to a loss of around 40,000 units from April’s report.

This is due to continued subdued order intake in Europe, caused by high interest rates and elevated living costs.

The downturn also takes into account US automotive tariffs, which were announced in March, as well as ongoing uncertainty surrounding broader trade duties since April, growing instability in the Middle East, and the continued Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Global EV growth continues

Meanwhile, Global EV deliveries, which combine battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), are forecast to rise by 19.8% in 2025 to 21.29 million units. This represents an increasingly positive outlook, with a 19.2% improvement forecasted in April.

However, this improvement would still be below 2024’s 25.3% increase. This was, however, with a lower total volume of 17.78 million EVs registered.

This year’s double-digit global EV growth is expected to come despite some governments phasing out purchase incentives and tax breaks amid mounting national debt, particularly in Europe. Non-Triad markets and robust PHEV demand in Europe have held up the forecast, offsetting downgrades in China and North America.

While EVs took a 19.9% share of the global light-vehicle market in 2024, the powertrain grouping is predicted to capture 23.6% of overall sales this year. This figure is stable from April’s forecast.

BEVs are expected to take a 65.1% share of the light vehicle EV market in 2025, with a year-on-year delivery improvement of 22.9%. PHEVs are forecast to see slower growth of 14.3% giving them a 34.9% share.

This is a drop from the 36.6% PHEV share in 2024, when the powertrain outpaced BEVs in terms of growth. The former enjoyed a 55.1% surge in volumes compared to BEVs’ 12.8% improvement.

Longer-term forecasts

Looking further forward, the global EV share is forecast to reach 26.4% in 2026, before improving to 42.2% in 2030, reaching 64.2% in 2035, and 83.1% in 2040. However, budget pressures and policy shifts may threaten investment in incentives and charging infrastructure, which could impact the outlook.

The global volume of EVs is set to rise from 21.29 million units in 2025 to 40.15 million registrations in 2030. A total of 64.02 million deliveries are expected in 2035, increasing to 86.7 million units in 2040. This figure is almost five times the number of EV sales recorded in 2024.

Annual traction battery demand is forecast to increase from just under 0.87 TWh in 2024 to around 5.77 TWh in 2040. The latter is nearly seven times the actual annual demand seen last year.

EV Volumes also forecasts that global battery demand for light vehicles will surpass 1TWh in 2025.

This is driven by the quest for longer electric ranges in all vehicle segments. Yet, the trend for larger batteries is slowing as they gain in efficiency. Furthermore, lower costs facilitate the electrification of smaller vehicles, where profit margins are tighter.

The number of EVs in operation is increasing rapidly. However, their share of the overall light-vehicle fleet is developing with a considerable delay.

There are 1.33 billion light vehicles on the road today, with plug-ins accounting for just 4.1% of this total. EV Volumes predicts it will take until 2043 for more than half of the global fleet to be electric. This is calculated using their current forecast for EV growth, which assumes normal scrappage rates.

Europe set for decline?

In Western and Central Europe, EV Volumes expects that light-vehicle sales will decline by 0.3% year-on-year in 2025. This is lower than their interim April 2025 forecast, which projected a 0.1% increase. It is also a significant drop from the predicted growth of just under 0.7% in their March forecast.

A total of 14.91 million light vehicles are expected to take to European roads in 2025, a 0.3% decline compared to 2024. This is slightly down from April’s forecast of 14.99 million units and still well below the 18.04 million light vehicles registered in 2019.

This downward revision comes as uncertainty persists regarding the impact of changing goods tariffs, developments in Ukraine, and escalating tensions in the Middle East. EV Volumes also assumes a growing risk of rising inflation, oil prices, and energy costs, which will lead to weaker private consumption across the region.

Furthermore, the OECD’s June 2025 economic outlook predicts that GDP in the Euro area will grow by only 1% in 2025.

Due to weaker goods exports to the USA and a struggling services sector, EV Volumes sees registrations of LCVs already being affected by trade frictions and tariffs. Passenger-car sales are expected to follow suit.

European regulatory and economic factors

Moreover, EV Volumes does not expect the European market to return to its 2019 volume level within the current forecast horizon, which stretches to 2040. In 2026, a 1.9% growth in European light-vehicle sales is projected. This hinges on a complex combination of regulatory and economic factors.

Meeting the required lower CO2 emissions targets and circularity requirements mandated by the European Commission will necessitate a major increase in EV sales. This could trigger a price war, supported by lower lithium costs. OEMs may also restrict the supply of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to avoid costly emissions fines.

On a positive note, Italy has announced €597 million in funding for a scrappage scheme, as reported by Il Sore 24 Ore. Meanwhile, Germany is considering the reintroduction of BEV incentives in 2025, after subsidies stopped at the end of 2023. However, the implementation of new subsidies may be delayed due to economic conditions.

Furthermore, more affordable BEVs are expected to enter Europe. Leading Chinese OEMs like BYD are also expanding in the region.

On the other side of the EV market, PHEV registrations are exceeding expectations. This additional volume is driven by the eased CO2 targets, expanded PHEV offerings from both European and Chinese players, and delayed launches of low-cost BEVs.

Additionally, the UK’s ban on new petrol and diesel models from 2030 still allows all hybrid types to be sold until 2035.

Altered European EV forecast?

As a result of these factors, EV Volumes expects that European electric light-vehicle sales will grow by 22.8% year-on-year in 2025 to 3.77 million units. This is a notable increase from April’s forecast of 3.51 million registrations, translating to a year-on-year rise of 14.3%.

EVs are predicted to represent 25.3% of total light-vehicle sales this year, up from a 20.5% share in 2024. In the previous forecast, the increase was projected to be 23.4%.

Broken down, BEV volumes are forecast to grow by 20.6% year-on-year and account for 67.4% of the 2025 EV mix. Meanwhile, PHEV sales are expected to increase by 27.7%.

Driven by new model launches, lower prices, and stricter emissions targets, EV Volumes forecasts that EVs will reach a 29.2% share of European light-vehicle sales in 2026. Then, BEVs and PHEVs are expected to account for more than one in three registrations in 2027.

The EV share is then projected to rise to 62.9% in 2030, reaching 93.5% in 2035, and 99.4% in 2040. The forecast for 2035 and beyond includes some tolerance for timing interpretations of the ICE sales ban and allows for exemptions for vehicles that may be considered unsuitable for full electrification.

China boosts domestic production

Considering the current economic headwinds, China’s government has focused on boosting domestic automotive consumption. Additional support has been directed toward state-owned OEMs.

However, trade friction with the US has added uncertainty, and China’s economic growth in 2025 is expected to fall short of the 5% target.

The country’s scrappage scheme, which offers higher trade-in bonuses for EVs than for petrol vehicles, has supported the market’s strength alongside a favourable cost of ownership and increasingly competitive pricing.

After launching in April 2024, the program has been extended beyond the original January 2025 deadline, as reported by the International Council on Clean Transportation. However, it has been suspended in several cities, which could disproportionately reduce demand for EVs given their higher bonus levels, electrive reported.

A stable outlook?

Taking all these factors into account, EV Volumes maintained its 2025 Chinese light-vehicle market forecast of 26.7 million units, an improvement of 2.7% year-on-year.

EVs are forecast to represent 51.4% of all light-vehicle sales this year, up 7.1pp from its 2024 market share. This is then projected to increase to 72.8% in 2030, before growing to 88.3% in 2035, and 95.5% in 2040.

Chinese OEMs continue launching new PHEVs and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs). Yet, BEVs are regaining momentum, bolstered by aggressive discounting initiated by BYD. As such, BEVs are forecast to account for 61.5% of EV sales in 2025 after reaching a 57.7% share of the EV market in 2024. This share will then grow to two thirds by 2030.

Forecast volumes in China are based on retail sales, not wholesales. This excludes exports and inventory build-up, which explains the differences from the typically higher wholesale-based figures published by other agencies.

Tariffs impact Northern America

The Northern American automotive market, which includes the US and Canada, is impacted by the 25% tariffs imposed by the US on imported vehicles.

To reduce the impact, there are adjustments for US parts content in Canadian and Mexican-built models, but even vehicles assembled in the US do not escape unscathed. This is because the tariffs still apply to non-US components.

Average new car prices in the US are expected to increase by 5% by the end of 2025, which in turn could reduce sales by 8%, according to J.D. Power representatives.

On a more positive note, a reimbursement scheme was implemented by the US government at the end of April, which offers OEMs tariff relief over two years. Carmakers assembling vehicles in the US can receive a credit worth up to 3.75% of the vehicle’s manufacturer’s suggested retail price. This then drops to 2.5% in year two.

So far, prices have largely held steady. However, discounting has weakened and an increase in vehicle demand referred to as the “pre-tariff bump” had already subsided by June.

Meanwhile, a Republican-backed Senate bill will see EV tax credits of up to $7,500 (€6,420) disappear by 30 September. This has led to carmakers urging buyers to take delivery of a new model by the deadline, according to Reuters. Any resulting pull-forward effect in 2025 is likely to be offset by weaker demand due to higher vehicle prices.

In Canada, funding for the iZEV programme ran out in January 2025, with BEV uptake falling and no replacement scheme announced.

Revising downward

Considering these developments, EV Volumes lowered its 2025 light-vehicle sales forecast for Northern America to 17.66 million units, a decline of 1% year on year. This would be a weak performance for the market after its 2.9% growth in 2024.

The long-term outlook has also been revised downward, by around 29,000 sales in 2026 and 65,000 units in 2027.

The combined BEV and PHEV share is now expected to fall from 10.2% in 2024 to 9.9% this year. In 2026, the EV market hold is projected to rise modestly to 11.1%. This is expected to be primarily supported by a more affordable Tesla model.

The EV share is then forecast to climb to 22.5% in 2030 and 41% in 2035. BEVs are PHEVs are predicted to make up 60.3% of the overall Northern American market in 2040, some distance below the expected global EV share of over 80%.

Non-triad outlook improves

In non-Triad markets, light-vehicle sales are expected to increase by 1.8% in 2025 to 30.88 million units.

This was an upward revision of 0.1pp from April, when the weaker global economic outlook, especially considering US trade tariffs, led EV Volumes to downgrade its growth projections. However, June’s forecast is still below the 2.3% improvement projected in the March forecast.

The EV share in non-Triad countries is forecast to reach 6.6% in 2025. This would be ahead of the 5.9% market hold projected in April’s outlook, and the 4.5% share recorded last year. Total electric light-vehicle sales are predicted to reach 2.03 million units this year, around 234,000 deliveries higher than the previous forecast.

This total would translate to an EV sales growth of 49.5% year on year, even higher than the 34.2% increase recorded in 2024. BEVs are forecast to see volumes rise by 43% in 2025, while PHEVs are projected to enjoy an even greater increase of 72.9%. In turn, the BEV share of the EV light-vehicle market is expected to drop from 78.5% to 75.2%.

EV subsidies implemented

Several factors may have influenced this upward revision and projection of strong growth. Firstly, Japan increased the budget for EV subsidies under the Clean Vehicle Energy Subsidy Programme in early 2025. Elsewhere, India cut import duties for premium EVs as part of a new manufacturing programme in June 2025, as written by Business Standard.

Indonesia introduced a VAT exemption for low-emission vehicles in January 2025 and a reduced VAT rate thereafter. Finally, in response to US tariffs, South Korea launched temporary stimulus measures, including financing support and higher EV subsidies, Reuters reported.

However, budget constraints driven by higher defence spending and macroeconomic concerns may limit future incentive schemes. The non-Triad EV share is projected to reach 16.8% in 2030, then 41.6% in 2035, and 76.7% in 2040. This means the region’s EV market generally lags the global adoption curve by about five years.",https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/global-evv-14-7-25-e1752504172518.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:27:18.679203

However, the policy stances of becoming a low-carbon economy, particularly the evolving regulatory frameworks pertaining to the energy mix give rise to energy-related uncertainty. Policy uncertainty is a phenomenon in which government prospective actions are ambiguous, propelling market volatility and making individuals and businesses postpone their spending and investing patterns for a period of time until the uncertainty somehow (Bernanke 1983a; Jurado et al. 2015; Baker et al. 2016; Younis et al. 2024). Policy shifts alters the dynamics of renewable energy sources and compel businesses to reconsider their decisions in the sector. Footnote 1 Ambiguous energy policies make businesses adopt wait and see strategy are refrain to opt for investing in long-term capital-intensive and innovative projects, owing to the risks of cost of capital (Eryilmaz and Homans 2013). The risk of renewable energy augments with frequent policy changes and hence alters both the demand and supply for energy (Omri and Nguyen 2014; Sharif et al. 2020). The energy sector is highly responsive to policy uncertainty and the energy production, distribution, and consumption are highly regulatory dependent. Environmental regulations changes, tax breaks for the renewable energy sector, and geopolitical factors are prime factors propelling uncertainty within the energy sector, altering investments, and overall dynamics of the markets (Adedoyin and Zakari 2020). A volatile policy environment also disturbs supply chains and propels operational costs, which pass on and burden consumers. Consumers suffer from the uncertainty in the shape of higher prices, ultimately decreasing their purchasing power, negatively affecting both consumer spending and overall economic vitality. High policy uncertainty tends to reduce consumer spending and make households cognizant about their future financial prospects (Bloom 2014; Basu and Bundick 2017). Against this backdrop, this research work aims to answer the question; how does energy-related uncertainty affect business and consumer confidence in China?

This study attempts to expand the existing literature in the following manner. First, A plethora of literature has addressed the economic and financial consequences of economic policy uncertainty (inter ali, Bloom et al. 2007; Baker et al. 2016; Arbatli et al. 2017; Bonaime et al. 2018; Carrière-Swallow and Céspedes 2013; Gulen and Ion 2015; Jurado et al. 2015; Walkup 2016; Plakandaras et al. 2019; Duong et al. 2020; Lam et al. 2020; Sha et al. 2020; Xu 2020; Hammer et al. 2023; Gyamerah and Asare 2024). Limited attempts linked business confidence with economic policy uncertainty (Adekoya and Oliyide 2021; Montes and Nogueira 2022). However, to the best of our knowledge, the existing literature lacks evidence to either support or negate the postulation of how energy-related uncertainty influences business and consumer confidence in China. Ullah et al. (2025) studied the relationship of business and consumer confidence and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). The prime difference between the current and Ullah et al. (2025) study is that unlike the broad economic uncertainty measure used in their study, we aim to study whether business and consumer confidence exhibit vulnerability towards energy-related uncertainty. The postulation is worth studying owing to regulatory changes introduced by Chinese government to address the pressing issue of climate change. Consequently, this shift from dirty to clean energy sources pertaining to technology, investment and policy frameworks, affecting energy production and consumption, influencing businesses and consumers sentiments. The economic dynamics of a country stipulate to business and consumer confidence (Montes and Nogueira 2022; Gholipour et al. 2023). Second, we utilize a novel energy-related uncertainty recently introduced by (Dang et al. 2023). This index is constructed from the uncertainty espoused by both economic and energy facets. The authors replicated the economic uncertainty facets following the work of Ahir et al. (2022). To extract energy facets, the authors extended the Afkhami et al. (2017). Dang et al. (2023) used 87 exact words along with 15 additional words to gauge shocks and crises in energy sectors. Since the uncertainty indices are mainly newspaper search-based indices (Alexopoulos and Cohen 2015; Baker et al. 2016). Nonetheless, like Ahir et al. (2022), while constructing the energy uncertainty index, the author(s) adopted another approach for text searches and used monthly country reports from the EIU (Economist Intelligence Unit) by taking insights from Ahir et al. (2022) study. EIU has a standard coverage strategy in producing its monthly reports for a country, which covers unexpected concerns regarding ideological bias, consistency, and accuracy (Ahir et al. 2022).

Third, taking insight from the literature that economic and financial variables often exhibit non-linear characteristics (Baruník et al. 2017; Bigerna 2023; Huynh et al. 2023; Jithin 2025), the study utilizes the novel quantile-on-quantile (henceforth, QQ) regression approach of Sim and Zhou (2015), to model the relationship between energy-related uncertainty and business/consumer confidence in China. The selection of the QQ is endorsed by Broock et al. (1996), BDS non-linearity test which affirms the postulation of data non-normality for the selected variables. Kruse. The prime advantage of the QQ approach is unlike the conventional quantile regression (QR), this approach determines the association between the dependent variable (Y) and independent variable (X) across different quantiles of Y and X, which enables us to identify the homogenous/heterogenous associations in quantile across the whole distribution of Y and X. This study takes the uniques case of China, as the country is the world’s largest consumer in terms of energy and changes in its energy policy have substantial implications for climate goals and global markets.

The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. The section “Literature review” outlines pertinent literature. The section “Data and estimation framework” relates to the data and estimation framework. The sections “Results and discussion” and “Robustness analysis for the QQ approach” outline empirical outcomes-cum-discussion and robustness checks, respectively. The section “Concluding remarks” reports concluding remarks along with the study limitations and future research directions.

Bernanke (1983b) postulated real option theory stating that owing to uncertainty, investors’ demand decreases, as they develop negative sentiments. In such situation, they prefer to hold investments and go for viable prospective investments amid uncertainty. Inadequate energy sources decrease the pace of industrialization, ultimately retarding the wheel of economic growth (Fattouh and El-Katiri 2013). Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) influences asset prices as it alters the investment decisions of economic agents and firms. These decisions pertain to employment, savings, and consumption (Gulen and Ion 2016). EPU also influences supply and demand, thereby leading to economic contraction (You et al. 2017). EPU has a hostile impact on a firm’s operations, consumer behavior, innovation, and economic activity (Caldara et al. 2016; Bhattacharya et al. 2017). An adequate energy supply lubricates various aspects of an economy such as industry and infrastructure development, tourism, and information technology (Sun et al. 2024). Nonetheless, the prevailing environmental concerns have compelled governments, including China to adopt sustainable practices and move from non-renewable energy sources generating carbon emissions to clean and environmentally friendly resources. Elevated energy prices render low-profit margins for businesses and compel form to reassess their operational strategies. Corporations which are dependent on energy are more vulnerable to increases in energy costs as they tend to scale back investments, ultimately affecting their confidence.

Consumers require oil to fulfill their basic needs including food, accommodation and transportation (Hong et al. 2022). Economic uncertainty defined by fluctuations in energy prices is a prime determinant of consumer confidence. When consumers are confronted by uncertainty in the economy owing to volatility in energy prices, consumer confidence diminishes as majority of the consumers adopt a cautious spending strategy (Ghosh 2022). Xu et al. (2022) demonstrated that the tendency of affordability of higher oil prices is relatively higher in younger and well-educated consumers as they can afford it through annual flows of stable income, hence, consumer confidence does not diminish with an increase in oil prices. Knez et al. (2022) correlated energy price changes to economic well-being, showing that there is a significant impact of energy price changes on developing countries. They concluded that as energy costs increase, the households shift their priorities from sustainable to unsustainable energy practices, thereby confining novel energy sustainable economic development. Barsky and Sims (2012) associated consumer confidence with macroeconomic dynamics. They obtained that consumer sentiment is one of the prime predictors of business cycles. The confidence of consumers declines with an increase in energy prices because of consumers tend to curtail spending on goods and services which are non-essential. This reduction on behalf of consumers negatively affects both businesses and economic growth. Volatility in oil price has negative and significant impact on consumer sentiment in G7 economies (Azad and Serletis 2024).

Compared to the developed world, elevated energy prices are bearing more negative influence on the developing world, especially the third world countries. Okushima (2017) observed that income disparities and limited access to essential energy services add to energy poverty, leaving households vulnerable to energy price fluctuations, thereby negatively influencing the economic conditions of developing countries. Streimikiene and Kyriakopoulos (2023) asserted that recent major global crises, such as geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukrainian and the COVID-19 pandemic, have soared energy prices, which has disturbed the financial condition of households in the developing regions. Huynh (2016) asserted that energy price shocks influence business cycles, and have significant ramifications for economic stability. Energy supply shocks defined by global oil prices elevate uncertainty, which increases business costs and disturbs prospective planning of businesses, as they adopt conservative approach; to tackle the risk of fluctuating energy prices, all of which have negative consequences for both business and consumer confidence. Shayaa et al. (2018) ascertained that consumer confidence mostly revolves around the stability of personal finances and the economic condition of the country. Heightened energy prices add to the inflation, making consumers hesitant to spend and households prioritize essential discretionary spending over the non-essential ones, which leads to economic decline. Elevated energy price leads to adverse economic conditions and cultivate risk-averse attitude among businesses (Jude et al. 2023; Razi et al. 2024).

Chen et al. (2020) suggest that renewable energy investment ensures higher economic stability, as such sources tend to have predictable pricing structures, unlike fossil fuels. Bolstering renewable energy consumption does not only affect energy costs but also strategically enhances overall economic resilience. Heightened uncertainty related to oil prices paves the way for renewable energy sources as businesses perceive the latter to be more sustainable in the long run (Lin and Wang 2023). Zhang et al. (2023) highlighted those geopolitical tensions directly influence the dynamics of energy supply, which alter strategic decision-making of the businesses. Energy-related uncertainty (EUI) stifles economic activities at (both country and industry levels), and this phenomenon has been observed to be more pronounced during the global financial crisis, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Dang et al. 2023). Chen et al. (2024) investigated whether volatility in oil prices and economic policy uncertainties influence global corporate investment. They obtained that both oil price volatility and economic policy uncertainties have detrimental impact on global corporate investment. Dagar et al. (2024) explored that global energy security receives negative spillovers from economic policy uncertainty (EPU), as it decreases the range of alternative energy sources, therefor policymakers shall focus on carbon-free energy security to ensure energy stability and diversification. Energy uncertainties prompt manufacturing industries to pour in more investment in innovation and technology domains for the transition from conventional energy sources. The conducive environment in the shape of digitalization and institutional quality support this strategic investment decision of the manufacturing industries (Anh et al. 2024). In a nutshell, the extant literature provides evidence that energy-related uncertainty and volatility in energy prices have marked influence on economic activities. It worthy to mention that the transition of striking a balance between existing and new energy sources is not straightforward and somehow challenging, particularly in the context of China, which is transitioning from dirty to new energy sources, creating uncertainty in China’s energy-mix, which in turn, influences both businesses and consumers confidence. This study aims to assess the influence of varying levels of energy-related uncertainty on varying levels businesses and consumers confidence in the context of China.

The data for business and consumer confidence indices is retrieved from the CIEC database and energy-related uncertainty data is taken from the website (www.policyuncertainty.com). The energy-related index is a text based indexed recently constructed by Dang et al. (2023). This index captures uncertainty pertaining to the energy-related factors in the energy market. The business confidence (BC) and Consumer confidence (CC) are survey-based indices measuring optimism and pessimism about businesses and consumers. The data span of this research from February 2000 to October 2022. This data span is stipulated to the availability of the data. For empirical analysis, the data has been transformed to logarithmic form. Owing to asymmetric characteristics, the recent literature utilizes nonlinear approaches in various domains of economics and finance. In this respect, we resort to the Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) endorsed by Sim and Zhou (2015). Although the conventional quantiles regression (QR) covers the heterogeneity characteristics, it does delineate entire distributional association between independent and dependent variables (Wan et al. 2024). The QQ regression approach has given preference over conventional quantile regression (QR) as the latter only determines the mean influences of the dependent variable and ignores its entire distribution. The QQ estimation envelopes the benefits of both quantile regression and non-parametric estimations. The QQR approach not only integrates the nuances of the conventional QR and non-parametric estimation but also tackles the endogeneity issue (Wang, 2024). The determination of association across the entire distribution between the explanatory and explained variable enables us to know if the variables have homogenous/heterogenous or neutral associations in the lower, medium, or high quantiles.

To model the studied variables, we begin with the framework of QQ estimation:

$${{\rm{CON}}}_{{\rm{t}}}={{\rm{\gamma }}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}\left({{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}}\right)+{{{u}}}_{{\rm{t}}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}$$

Where \({{``} {\rm{CON}}}_{{{t}}}\mbox{''}\) stands for business/consumer confidence at period t, EU denotes energy-related uncertainty, \({\rm{\theta }}\) indicates the \({{\rm{\theta }}}^{{\rm{th}}}\) quantile of energy-related uncertainty and \({{\rm{\gamma }}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}\) is yet to be determined owing to the unlimited knowledge on the nexus between business confidence and energy-related uncertainty and the quantile disturbance term is denoted by \({{\rm{u}}}_{{\rm{t}}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}\). Next, we linearize the function \({{\rm{\gamma }}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}\) (.) around the quantile of \({{\rm{EU}}}^{{\rm{\tau }}}\) by taking insights from the “local linear technique” of Cleveland (1979) as follows:

$${{{\gamma }}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}\left({{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}}\right)\approx \,{{{\gamma }}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}{{\rm{EU}}}^{{\rm{\tau }}}+{\rm{\gamma }}{{\rm{\theta }}}^{{\prime} }\left({{\rm{EU}}}^{{\rm{t}}}\right)\left({{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}}-{{\rm{EU}}}^{{\rm{\tau }}}\right)$$

(2)

The sign \({\gamma \; \theta }{\prime}\) signifies the partial derivative of\(\,{\gamma }^{\theta }\left({{{\rm{EU}}}}_{t}\right)\) pertaining to \({{EU}}_{t}\), also known the marginal effect. Following Sim and Zhou (2015) work, we redefine \(\gamma\)θ(\({{EU}}^{\tau }\)) and \(\gamma\)θ′ (\({{EU}}^{\tau }\)) as \({\gamma }_{0}\) = (θ,τ) and \({\gamma }_{1}\) = (θ,τ) and re-frame Eq. (2) in the following manner:

$${{{\gamma }}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}\left({{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}}\right)\approx {{{\gamma }}}_{0}\left({\rm{\theta }},{\rm{\tau }}\right)+{{{\gamma }}}_{1}^{{\prime} }\left({\rm{\theta }},{\rm{\tau }}\right)\left({{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}}-{{\rm{EU}}}^{{\rm{\tau }}}\right)$$

(3)

To replicate the QQ estimation process pioneered by Sim and Zhou (2015), Eq. (3) is substituted into Eq. (2) to get a new equation as given below:

$${{\rm{CON}}}_{{\rm{t}}}=\frac{{{{\gamma }}}_{0}\left({\rm{\theta }},{\rm{\tau }}\right)+\,{{{\gamma }}}_{1}\left({\rm{\theta }},{\rm{\tau }}\right)\left({\rm{EU}}-{\rm{EU}}\right)+{{{u}}}_{{\rm{t}}}^{{\rm{\theta }}}\,}{(* )}$$

(4)

In Eq. (4), (∗) refers to the conditional quantile of BC. Moreover, Eq. (4) affirms the association between the relationship between the quantile business confidence (\({\theta }^{{th}}\)) and the quantile of energy-related uncertainty (\({\tau }^{{th}}\)) of parameters \({\gamma }_{0}\) and \({\gamma }_{1}\). Following the ordinary least square (OLS) approach, Eq. (5) is obtained through a simple minimization, which, in turn, determines the impact of energy-related uncertainty on business/consumer confidence.

$$\mathop{\rm{min}}\limits_{{{{\gamma }}}_{0}{{{\gamma }}}_{1}}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{{i}}}^{{{n}}}{\rm{\rho }}{\rm{\theta }}\left[{{\rm{CON}}}_{{\rm{t}}}-{{{\gamma }}}_{0}-{{{\gamma }}}_{1}(\widehat{{{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}}}-\widehat{{{\rm{EU}}}^{{\rm{\tau }}}})-\alpha (\theta )\left(\right.{{{r}}}_{{\rm{t}}-1}\right]{{{ K}}}\left(\frac{{{{F}}}_{{{n}}}\hat{({\rm{EU}}_{{{t}}}-{\rm{\tau }})}}{{{h}}}\right)$$

(5)

Note, \(\rho \theta\) represents quantile loss function and K(.). K\(\left(* \right){\rm{is}}\) the kernel density function and \(h\) is the bandwidth parameter. Where K\((.)\) measures the observation of \({{\rm{EU}}}\) while minimal weights are inversely assigned to the distribution function of \(\hat{{{{\rm{EU}}}}_{t}}\) and \(\hat{{{{\rm{EU}}}}^{\tau }}\) as:

$${{\rm{F}}}_{{\rm{n}}}\widehat{({{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}})}=\frac{1}{{\rm{n}}}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{\rm{k}}=1}^{{\rm{n}}}{\rm{I}}(\widehat{{{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{k}}}} < \widehat{{\rm{EU}}}_{{\rm{t}}})$$

(6)

Sim and Zhou (2015) asserted that non-parametric analysis predicates the bandwidth selection, as it determines the neighborhood close to the target point, and therefore controls the smoothness of the measurement. In this respect, we have employed a bandwidth parameter h = 0.05 in the study.

Correlation analysis

Figure 1 provides preliminary information regarding the correlation of the variables. The correlation matrix shows that business and consumer confidence is negatively correlated to energy-related uncertainty. The corresponding values of each variable in the matric are in the acceptable range, suggesting that the model is free from multicollinearity issues.

Descriptive statistics

Table 1 reports the stochastic properties of variables, the mean values of all variables are positive. The data for energy-related uncertainty and business confidence is negatively skewed. Consumer confidence has the highest standard deviation followed by business confidence. The values of kurtosis for all the variables are greater than three and the probability values corresponding the Jarque-Bera statistics are significant at 5 and 10% levels, respectively; which entails that our model is exhibiting nonlinear characteristics. These outcomes infer to utilize asymmetric approach such as the QQ approach.

The time-series models usually exhibit non-normality owing to financial or social events. To further ascertain nonlinearity in the model, we apply the BDS test by Broock et al. (1996). The results of the BDS test, suggest that energy-related uncertainty and business/consumer confidence are showing nonlinear properties as all the values corresponding to the variables included in the model are significant at each embedding dimension. Table 2 summarizes the outcomes of the BDS test.

Kruse nonlinear unit root test

To further validate the stationarity and nonlinear characteristics of the model, the Kruse (2011) nonlinear unit root test is employed on the data series. This test not only assesses the stationarity issues but also determines if the data series exhibit nonlinearity at various specifications such as with constant, without constant and with constant and trend. The obtained results in Table 3 entail that unit root properties in energy uncertainty, business confidence, and consumer confidence are rejected as their corresponding probabilities are less than 1% and 10%, respectively. These inferences suggest that the model is exhibiting a non-linear stationary process.

The outcomes of the QQ approach are mainly pictorial. Figures 3 and 4 show the relationship between two variables i.e., energy-related uncertainty and business confidence at different points in their distributions. The results suggest that there is negative relationship between the quantiles of business confidence and the quantiles of energy-related uncertainty. In other words, business confidence tends to decrease as the level of energy-related uncertainty increases. Unclear energy policies with frequent regulatory changes make it difficult for businesses to predict future costs, resultantly they refrain or postpone from long-term planning such as opting for investment in the energy sector. Such scenario leads to low investment in the sector, affecting business confidence and economic activity. As energy uncertainty slows down economic activity, the level of economic uncertainty goes up. Economic uncertainty substantially impact various pillars of economic activity such as prices, consumption, and outputs, all of which create challenges for businesses and affect their performance (Adekoya and Oliyide 2021).

Figures 2 and 3 depict the QQ results of energy-related uncertainty (EU) and consumer confidence in China. The outcomes depicted by the color 2D and 3D graphs imply that the lower quantiles of EPU are negative affecting the lower to medium quantiles of CC. These results entail economic uncertainty personal investment and consumption decisions as the consumers keep themselves cognizant of fulfilling the necessities amid high uncertain period. High uncertainty espouses unemployment and alters personal investment and consumption choices (Al-Thaqeb et al. 2022). We also noticed that the lower quantiles of EPU positively affect the higher quantiles of CC. These outcomes suggest that the period of high uncertainty trims household expenditures but there is certain consumption on behalf of the household which are to be made and when the uncertainty is low the consumer spends more at that time to buy items for the future to remain well-off in the future when uncertainty will be high.

In Figs. 4 and 5, the association between energy-related uncertainty and consumer confidence is negative except for a few quantiles, which entails that consumer confidence tends to dissipate as energy uncertainty in the sector rises. Uncertainty in energy policy makes consumers wary of increasing energy costs in the future, which decreases their confidence and purchasing power, as they have to face the challenge of increased costs of goods and services and higher utility bills that rely on energy owing to the inflationary pressure. High energy uncertainty brings fluctuation in consumer confidence as they stipulate energy uncertainty to economic stability, which in turn, defines their perception of job security and financial well-being. Since domestic consumption most defined economic activity in China, losing consumer confidence owing to energy-related uncertainty may have considerable consequences. Decreased consumer confidence vis-a-vis uncertain energy policies highlight the interdependent nature of consumer sentiment, economic stability, and energy. To maintain consumer confidence, clear and consistent policies regarding energy hold prime significance for China as it will both businesses and consumers to opt for more renewable solutions.

This research evaluates the response of business and consumer confidence towards energy-related uncertainty in China for the period. Owing to the shock vulnerability, time series data often exhibit asymmetric behavior; hence we began with the BDS test, which deduced that the model displays nonlinearity. Therefore, utilize the novel QQ methodology to study the heterogenous/homogenous behavior of the model. The outcomes imply that business confidence decreases with high level of energy-related uncertainty across the entire distribution. Consumer confidence also tends to decrease vis-à-vis the high level of energy-related uncertainty for majority of the quantiles, except a few. Based on the empirical outcomes, we deduce that high level of energy uncertainty erodes the confidence of both businesses and consumers.

Policymakers should refrain from frequent regulatory changes in the energy market as high energy uncertainty about future costs causes both local and foreign firms to delay or cancel new projects that otherwise might have supported innovation and business expansion. Businesses opt out of investment, particularly in renewable energy infrastructure, where payback time is long, and ponder that policy landscape may change before they realize returns. The fluctuations in energy prices propels operational costs and hurt profitability. Owing to high energy uncertainty the notion of holding cash also increases as firms allocate more resources to monitor and adjust to policy shifts, ultimately increasing their cost of risk management. High risk in the energy sector tends to discourage both local and foreign investors from investing. The risk of high energy-related uncertainty also erodes consumer confidence as high energy costs translate to higher prices for goods and services, altering the dynamics of the cost of living, encouraging savings over spending, and reduce consumer spending.

These results of the study hold prime significance in the context of China, where the higher authorities are continually striving to enhance energy efficiency by reducing carbon emissions for realizing sustainable economic progression. Nonetheless, the challenge of implementing policies coming from central to local government persists, which mars business and consumer confidence and slows down national sustainable economic targets. These effects call for of consistent, conspicuous, and forward-looking policies pertaining to the energy sector to maintain both businesses and consumers’ confidence in China at par. In this regard, striking an equilibrium between economic and environmental targets is indispensable. A gradual policy shift from conventional energy sources to clean energy sources will not only minimize the burden on both businesses and consumers but boost their confidence, fostering a stable economic environment. The policy-makers need to have conspicuous communication regarding energy policy changes and shall consider all the stakeholders while devising policies for the energy mix. Such measures will not only maintain the confidence of businesses and consumers but will enable the Chinese government to realize the environmental targets and become a low-carbon economy. The current study only focuses on China, the world’s leading energy consuming country, and its pragmatic approach to tackle the global energy challenges such as renewable energy adoption, climate change and improved energy efficiency. Future studies can work on the postulation by extending it to other emerging and developing economies. Utilizing the multivariate quantile-on-quantile (m-QQR) approach will further allow researchers to add more pertinent variables in the existing QQR model, leading to improved policy inferences.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-05300-1/MediaObjects/41599_2025_5300_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-07-14 16:18:47.085217

On July 4, President Trump signed into law the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA), following its narrow passage by the House and Senate. The OBBBA is an expansive, nearly 900-page budget reconciliation law that extends 2017-era tax cuts and includes a wide range of provisions that may affect city budgets, services, and infrastructure planning.

While the League, in coordination with our national partners, continue to analyze how the law will impact city operations, the following are key takeaways for cities now that the bill has been enacted:

Municipal finance and infrastructure

Municipal bonds: Despite numerous discussions about eliminating the tax-exempt status for municipal bonds, the final bill did not include that provision and retained the tax-exempt status for municipal bonds.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits: The law repeals or restricts many tax credits that qualified for elective pay, which allows cities and other tax-exempt entities to receive direct payments in lieu of tax credits for certain energy and climate resiliency projects. While the elective pay provision is unchanged, the law imposes more aggressive phase-out timelines for certain credits and eliminates others entirely, including the credit for commercial clean vehicles.

Elimination of certain grants: The law rescinds unobligated funds from several IRA programs and eliminates specific initiatives, including the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Environmental Justice Block Grants, Climate Pollution Reduction Grants, State-Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training Grants, and the Neighborhood Access and Equity Program.

Housing and economic development

Expansion of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits: The law increases allocations for 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties by 12% and lowers the private activity bond financing threshold from 50% to 25% of land and building costs for properties placed into service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Opportunity Zones: The law makes permanent the 2017-era Opportunity Zones program, which offers tax benefits for reinvesting capital gains in designated communities. It also eliminates capital gains taxes on investments held in these zones for at least 10 years.

National Environmental Policy Act: A new White House Council on Environmental Equality program will allow project sponsors to pay an optional fee for a fast-tracked environmental review process.

Other issues

AI regulation preemption: A House proposal to impose a 10-year moratorium on state-level regulation of artificial intelligence systems was removed by the Senate and did not make it into the final bill.

No tax on overtime and tips: The law allows employees who regularly receive tips to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal taxable income. It also permits a deduction of up to $12,500 in overtime pay. Learn more about the new law regarding taxing overtime and tips.

Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP): The law requires states to implement work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP participants and shifts more administrative and financial responsibility to states. States may also bear a larger share of Medicaid program costs as federal contributions decrease.

LMC staff take

Some impacts of the law are immediately clear, such as changes to the clean energy tax credits and the elimination of many IRA-funded grant and loan programs. Others, including potential ramifications of Medicaid funding cuts, are less certain. Given that, the Minnesota Legislature may choose to revise the state budget to address the increased financial burden caused by the reduced federal funding. This could affect cities if funding is cut from state-level programs that provide direct or indirect support to municipalities.

We are also closely monitoring how the state might reallocate resources to backfill lost federal funding. These adjustments could shift pressure onto other budget priorities that are critical to cities

California is the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy.

The state released new data showing California’s continued progress toward a clean energy future with 67% of the state’s retail electricity sales in 2023 coming from renewable and zero-carbon electricity generation — compared to just 61% the previous year and around 41% a decade ago. Sources of clean energy include generation from solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal and biomass.

In 2024, the state added a record-breaking 7,000 megawatts (MW) of clean capacity to the grid, representing the largest single-year increase in clean energy capacity added to the grid in state history. This new figure broke the previous records set in both 2022 and 2023, marking a third consecutive year of unprecedented clean energy growth.

Historic investments over the past 15 years have led to an extraordinary pace of development in new clean energy generation. And as the grid is increasingly powered by clean energy, pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period. The power sector is a major driver of the decline in greenhouse gases – emissions from electric power have been cut in half since 2009, helping the state achieve its emissions reductions goals years ahead of schedule.

California is home to the most clean energy jobs in the U.S. and the state’s renewable energy and clean vehicle industries lead the nation in growth. California boasts more than a half-million green jobs and has 7 times more clean jobs than fossil fuel jobs. Solar and wind jobs account for a majority of green jobs, and battery storage and grid modernization is the second-fastest growing sector within California’s clean energy workforce.

California continues to move at a rapid pace on bringing clean energy online. Since 2019, a record 25,000 MW of new energy resources statewide have been added to the grid, with most of that being solar and battery storage. This aligns with the Governor’s roadmap to the state’s clean energy future released in 2023, which called for 148,000 megawatts (MW) of new clean power by 2045.

“California has achieved yet another major milestone on our journey to a clean energy future. The latest numbers show how our state is demonstrating that clean energy is mainstream and is here to stay,” said California Energy Commission (CEC) Chair David Hochschild.

Sources eligible under the state’ Renewables Portfolio Standard – such as solar and wind – made up 43% of the power mix in 2023, up from 39% in 2022. Other zero carbon resources continue to power the grid with large hydro accounting for 12% and nuclear power at 12% in 2023.

“California has set ambitious clean energy goals, and utilities and community choice aggregators have stepped up to deliver clean resources at competitive prices to communities up and down the state,” said California Public Utilities Commission President Alice Reynolds. “We are bringing renewable energy online at an unprecedented scale and pace never seen before.”

Solar represents the technology with the largest amount of installed renewable energy capacity in the state – over 21,000 MW of solar capacity operates the electric grid and another 19,000 MW of behind-the-meter generation. The California grid regularly breaks solar generation peak record levels – the latest solar peak recorded in late May was over 21,500 MW of solar generation.

The state is also doubling down on its goals by swiftly increasing its battery energy storage capacity. The state’s battery fleet now stands at over 15,000 MW – 1,944% higher than when the Governor took office in 2019. The state’s storage fleet is regularly storing any available extra solar energy generated during the day, and supporting the grid by dispatching during the evening.

Clean energy days

More than 9 out of 10 days so far this year have been powered by 100% clean energy for at least some part of the day in California. In 2025, California’s grid has run on 100% clean electricity for an average of 7 hours a day.

Data compiled by the California Energy Commission shows clean energy has powered the equivalent of 51.9 days in the state – nearly 30% of the year to date running on 100% clean electricity. That already surpasses the amount of “clean energy days” last year – and represents a 750% increase in clean energy days since 2022.

Now, a newly passed federal spending bill has pulled the plug. President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” ends EV and plug-in hybrid tax credits on September 30, 2025. That leaves consumers a tight summer window to cash in on savings​ up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used models​ before Washington slams the vault shut.

And make no mistake: this is no temporary pause. It’s one of the most aggressive federal walk-backs on electrification policy to date. If you’re shopping for an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, the clock’s ticking​ and so is your potential to save thousands.

How does it compare to rivals?

The biggest rival right now isn’t another car​ it’s time. Only around 20 models qualify for full federal incentives, due to complicated rules around domestic manufacturing, battery sourcing, and price caps under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, and Tesla Model 3, Y, and Cybertruck still make the cut. Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 sneak in via leasing, thanks to a quirk in the legislation that awards credits to the leasing company rather than the buyer.

This leasing loophole has become the industry’s clever workaround. Many models that don’t qualify for tax credits under direct purchase​ such as foreign-built EVs​ can still benefit from credits if leased. The catch? It’s up to the leasing company to pass those savings along, and not all do. So shoppers should ask pointedly before signing anything with an “APR” on it.

Who is this for​ and who should skip it?

If you’ve been on the EV fence, this summer may be your best shot to leap off it. New electric vehicles remain expensive​ the average EV sells for about $63,000, a solid $13,000 more than a comparable gas-powered model. Tax credits helped narrow that gap for many buyers. Come October, they’ll be gone, leaving price-conscious shoppers to either pay full freight or wait for automakers to lower MSRPs voluntarily.

Shoppers looking at “affordable” EVs should be especially aware. The Chevy Equinox EV, touted as a sub-$30K electric crossover after incentives, could see its effective price jump by several thousand dollars this fall. And Slate Auto​ , a startup promising a $19,900 EV​ , recently updated its pricing to “mid-twenties.” Surprise, surprise. The base model budget EV is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

On the flip side, buyers who prioritize performance, luxury, or tech over price may shrug. For them, EV adoption isn’t just about cost​ it’s about experience. But don’t expect those tax credits to return soon. The political winds have shifted, and Washington’s wallet is staying closed.

The energy department sees peak hour energy supply demand increasing by at least 100 gigawatts by 2030, 50 of which can be directly attributed to data centers.","A Department of Energy (DOE) report indicates that the United States could face significant power shortages by 2030 if the closure of existing coal and natural gas-fired generation facilities continues amid huge growth in electricity demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The report identifies 104 gigawatts of existing capacity that is slated for closure in the next five years, while 210 gigawatts of new capacity is expected to come online in that time. Despite that large number, the new capacity is mostly wind and solar power, whose generation levels are a fourth or a third of what traditional sources produce, and must be backed up by duplicative power when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. If existing power plants are not kept operational, potential outages could occur in the mid-Atlantic and Great Plains regions. This finding is also supported by the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), which is responsible for the reliable operation of the power grid.

Out of the 210 gigawatts of new generation estimated to come online by 2030, only 22 gigawatts are considered “firm generation” that would come from coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. Around 124 gigawatts would be new solar, 32 gigawatts would be new wind-generated power, and 31 gigawatts would consist of four-hour storage batteries that must get their power from another generating source. Batteries support wind and solar power by releasing the stored power when there is no wind or sun. Because wind and solar are intermittent and weather-driven technologies, they are the wrong type of generation needed to address the reliability issue. AI data centers need reliable power 24/7, as do households and businesses. Data centers are expected to add anywhere from 35 gigawatts to 108 gigawatts in load growth to the grid by the end of the decade. The energy department sees peak hour energy supply demand increasing by at least 100 gigawatts by 2030, 50 of which can be directly attributed to data centers.

According to the agency, if the current plan continues, blackouts across the country would increase by 100 times. Further, new reliable capacity must come online as the department found that even if there are no retirements over the next five years, outage risks in several regions would still increase more than thirtyfold. According to the DOE report, it would be impossible for the nation’s bulk power system to meet the AI growth requirements while maintaining a reliable power grid and keeping energy costs low for Americans.

According to the DOE analysis, the hardest hit would be eastern states served by the PJM Interconnection grid. The agency sees weeks of power shortages in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia by 2030, resulting from power plant closures and data center expansion. Under the most severe weather conditions, based on history, power shortages in the area could total more than a month over the course of a year.

Grid operators in power markets such as PJM and the Southwest Power Pool agree that reliability is a major issue if the current rate of fossil plant retirements continues. Coal-fired plants, which supplied half of U.S. electricity just two decades ago, have seen their share decline to 15 percent, trailing natural gas plants and nuclear reactors, and about equal to wind and solar power’s share. According to Lanny Nickell, CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, peak demand is expected to be as much as 75%higher in 10 years, largely driven by electrification and data center growth.

Conclusion

According to the DOE, the massive deployment of wind and solar energy expected over the next five years will not be enough to support the growing power demand brought on by AI data centers and increased electrification that the Biden administration has pushed. While the U.S. electric grid is expected to see more than 200 gigawatts of new power generation by the start of the next decade, planned retirements of firm generation, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear, will continue to threaten reliability. The DOE estimates that 104 gigawatts of firm plant retirements are scheduled over the next five years. If this and the current pace of new additions of firm generation remain unchanged, the agency believes blackouts could increase across the country by 100-fold. The DOE report justifies President Trump’s belief that electricity demand growth from AI and increased electrification puts the U.S. electric grid in jeopardy of blackouts, which creates the need for his national emergency declaration to ward off the threat by increasing firm power on the grid.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bigstock-Flags-Of-Department-Of-Energy-329095531-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 15:19:32.469460

Trump’s Cuts Are a Disaster All Their Own.","Recent horrific floods across the country make investment in government, resilient infrastructure, and an end to climate-wrecking industries more important than ever.

Recent weeks have seen deadly, catastrophic flooding across the country. Our thoughts are with the families who have lost so much, from New Mexico, to Texas, to North Carolina. And our hearts are especially heavy knowing that these kinds of disasters are becoming all the more common because of climate change. Without action, they will keep getting more common and more dangerous.

Despite this, Donald Trump is dragging us backward toward climate hell. He’s expanding federal support for polluting industries (which already receive lucrative subsidies) and tearing down our growing clean energy industry. At the same time, he’s defunding programs and infrastructure that are vital amid our changing climate.

What we need instead is crystal clear: Funding for recovery, adaptation, and infrastructure, and, crucially, an end to the polluting industries that are wreaking havoc on our planet.

Trump Is Kneecapping Our Ability to Adapt and Respond to Climate Change

When it comes to disasters, early warning is critical to get folks out of harm’s way. But Trump is slashing federal programs crucial to researching and predicting extreme weather.

For example, the work of his “Department of Government Efficiency” led to many staff vacancies at the National Weather Service. The agency is down 600 employees from a high of 4000, including in Texas and in flood-prone areas across the country. With massive slashes to these services, more people will die in disasters they never saw coming.

Trump’s staffing cuts have also hit the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), responsible for immediate aid in the aftermath of disasters and long-term recovery efforts. Since January, DOGE’s efforts have cut FEMA staff by a third (2,000 staff members). Less than a month before the Texas floods, Trump announced he was considering dismantling FEMA entirely.

Texas is a major recipient of disaster aid, and yet the state’s Governor has advocated for cutting down FEMA and handing states the bill for recovery. This is unconscionable in a world of increasingly catastrophic disasters too big and expensive for states to take on by themselves. To adapt and respond to our climate-changed world, robust federal funding is non-negotiable.

Trump is Leaving Our Water Supplies Vulnerable to Disaster

Without adaptation improvements, climate disasters will increasingly cut off our access to clean water. Floods contaminate our water supplies with toxic pollution and can overwhelm or shut down treatment plants. Last year, Hurricane Helene left Asheville, North Carolina without clean drinking water for months, in great part due to aging, outdated infrastructure.

Our water infrastructure — the pipes and drains and treatment plants that deliver clean, safe water to our taps — may need as much as $1 trillion for climate adaptation by 2050.

Yet, Trump has proposed historic funding cuts to our water infrastructure. He wants to nearly eliminate the State Revolving Funds, the main avenue for federal funding to state and local water projects.

These cuts will not only make our water less safe; they’ll make it more expensive, too. If federal dollars dry up, local water systems will raise already-high rates so that we, the customers, cover upgrades.

Expanding Dirty Energy Will Make Things Worse

While Trump decimates federal aid for climate adaptation and disaster response, he’s ramping up support for the very industries responsible for them. He’s declared a bogus “national energy emergency” to speed up fossil fuel drilling, and he’s issued orders to fast-track fossil fuel infrastructure projects.

Recently, Trump’s Big Ugly Bill has mandated more oil and gas leases on public lands and waters, defunded clean energy and environmental justice programs, and gutted support for renewable energy.

And he’s not only boosting dirty energy; he’s boosting energy-hungry industries that are increasing demand for fossil fuels. Trump has thrown his weight behind cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, two technologies that need so much energy, they’re reviving dying coal plants and partnering with Big Oil companies.

This is the exact opposite of what our planet needs right now. A complete transition from fossil fuels to renewables is paramount in slowing climate chaos.

It’s also important to note that fossil fuels are more vulnerable to outages in extreme weather events. Transitioning to renewables not only helps us to fight climate change; it will keep life-saving electricity on during disasters.

Factory Farms: Even More Dangerous in the Flooding They Contribute To

Deadly flooding also recently hit North Carolina and New Mexico, two states with booming factory farm industries. These factory farms (hog and poultry in North Carolina, dairies in New Mexico) contribute directly to climate change. They’re a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that warms the climate 86 times as much as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

Factory farms also present a terrible danger to water quality and health, even more so during floods. These facilities, which cram as many as a million animals into tight confines, generate and store unimaginable amounts of manure. They store this manure in open pits, or “lagoons,” which can and have overflowed during storms.

In 2018, Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina, and millions of gallons of waste spilled from lagoons and contaminated many of the state’s waterways. Such spills can pollute waterways and groundwater with agricultural chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and pathogens like E. coli.

Factory farms don’t just contribute to these climate-fueled disasters; they make them even more dangerous for those caught in them. Now, after this month’s flash floods, North Carolina faces an “above normal” hurricane season that may bring even more devastation and factory farm flooding.

Trump’s budget cuts add salt to the wound. He’s proposed to slash the USDA National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) budget by 88%, which may affect a program to get North Carolina’s hog facilities out of floodplains.

Under the program, the state Department of Agriculture uses NRCS grants to buy conservation easements that would convert flood-prone land used for hog factory farms to more sustainable uses. But the program is already underfunded, and Trump’s cuts certainly aren’t helping.

Trump’s Cuts Are a Disaster All Their Own. Together, We Can Fight Them.

Flooding damage lasts long after the waters recede. Even if folks make it out with their homes and lives, they may face other problems, including unsafe drinking water and lost electricity during the hottest days of the year.

Donald Trump’s cruel policies will only make matters worse for communities that could soon face their own disaster. By one estimate, nearly 15 million homes in the U.S. face a substantial level of food risk.

We all deserve to feel safe in our communities and secure in the fact that, if something does go wrong, help will be on the way. Trump’s widespread government defunding and dismantling fly in the face of this. His policies pose massive risks to essential resources, our health, our safety, and our very lives.

But right now, Congress is working to codify even more of Trump’s extreme agenda into law. Lawmakers are crafting spending legislation for the upcoming year to fund government agencies and their programs, with guidance from a Trump proposal. That proposal includes the deep cuts to the State Revolving Funds and the Natural Resources Conservation Service mentioned above, as well as cuts on renewables, climate research, and so much more.

These recent floods are a dire warning about the importance of well-funded government and infrastructure, and our urgent need to end the industries wreaking havoc on our climate. In considering Trump’s draconian spending cuts, Congress is making life-or-death decisions. They need to choose life.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/evergreen_header_climate_flood_3a-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:31:00.341402

Nuclear power is both the economic and ecological solution to South Dakota energy independence.","EDITOR'S NOTE: Isaac Latterell is a former Republican member of the South Dakota House of Representatives and former Majority Whip.

South Dakota’s long, cold winters are often grumbled about, but for companies building the digital infrastructure of tomorrow, our chilly climate is one of our greatest assets. Massive data centers that power artificial intelligence and cloud computing generate enormous amounts of heat and require substantial energy to stay cool. That’s why companies like Midco and SDN Communications have invested heavily in South Dakota, where naturally cool air helps keep costs down and performance up.

Now, national players are taking notice. For example, Applied Digital recently proposed a multi-billion-dollar AI campus in South Dakota, which could bring 200 high-paying tech jobs and catapult the state to the forefront of AI computing infrastructure.

But these high-tech facilities don’t run on cold air and goodwill. They run on electricity. And while South Dakota generates much of its power from wind and hydro, these sources are weather dependent and can’t meet the growing demand.

Solar farms don’t fit well with long winters, and wind farms sprawl thousands of acres, with turbines scattered along every hillside. Meanwhile, a single nuclear plant can generate enough for a million homes. That means stable, round-the-clock power, without robbing our state of its beautiful wide open spaces.

Currently, when the wind doesn’t blow or the river slows, we rely on out-of-state nuclear plants to keep our lights and servers on. But that is not sustainable. As energy-hungry industries, from AI to electric vehicles and precision agriculture, take root in the Midwest, South Dakota cannot afford to be left behind. Instead, we must lead.

We must grow and help our nation secure energy independence. And the clearest path to that independence is expanding nuclear power here at home.Nuclear energy is carbon-free, safe and incredibly reliable. Unlike wind or solar, which operate at 25% to 35% capacity on average, nuclear plants consistently run at over 90% capacity and do not depend on weather patterns. Nuclear power is both the economic and ecological solution to South Dakota energy independence.

Thanks to advances in technology, new nuclear reactors can be built faster, safer, and at a scale that fits states like ours. NorthWestern Energy has already begun exploring the possibility of deploying one of these reactors in South Dakota by 2030.

One community that’s reportedly a possibility? Mitchell. At a South Dakota Public Utilities Commission meeting, Jeff Decker, a regulatory specialist with the company, said that Mitchell is one community that’s being considered. A nuclear facility there could bring new jobs, attract high-tech investment, and provide stable power to help fuel both the local economy and South Dakota’s growing data infrastructure.

This is exciting news, and it deserves our full support.

I have long wondered why we haven’t made nuclear power a cornerstone of American energy independence, while China has built 37 reactors since 2014! The truth is, building nuclear facilities is expensive, and investors take tremendous risk when starting a project of this scale. Without regulatory certainty and federal policies that treat nuclear energy fairly, they can’t afford to take the gamble.

Ideally, federal policy should provide a level playing field for energy development.

Instead, we’ve fallen behind China on nuclear development, and now we have no time to waste. That’s where the nuclear production tax credit (PTC) comes in. This credit helps level the playing field, allowing nuclear to compete with wind and solar projects, which enjoy generous subsidies from the federal government. And unlike many solar and wind incentives, they only get rewarded when they actually produce power.

Congress understands the critical role this tax credit plays in securing America’s energy future. That’s why it just passed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which preserves and supports the nuclear production tax credit. It understood that if the federal government favors only certain energy sources while neglecting the most reliable one, heavy energy use states like ours could ultimately bear the consequences.

Sen. Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Mike Rounds have long championed an all-of-the-above energy strategy that embraces nuclear power alongside our world-class wind and hydro resources. As Sen. Thune once said, we need to “regain our edge in the use of this clean-energy technology.” Their leadership will prove essential to pushing the tax credit across the finish line.

Our winters may be harsh, but our energy future doesn’t have to be uncertain. By supporting nuclear power through the tax credit and regulatory certainty, and by advancing projects like the one being discussed in Mitchell, South Dakota is poised to shine bright as a beacon of innovation, independence, and economic strength for decades to come.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/9fcd500/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1895x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F73%2F9f%2Fb9c552014767a98dbc771ebd666a%2Flatterell.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:28:57.275233

Ultium Cells, the joint venture between General Motors and South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution, plans to upgrade its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce multiple battery chemistries under one roof, including its newer, cheaper version.

The companies said July 14 that funding for the upgrades stems from a $2.3-billion investment first announced in 2021 and will allow Ultium to scale production of lithium iron phosphate battery cells, a lower-cost alternative to the nickel-rich batteries the companies also produce together.

Ultium Cells Spring Hill began production in April 2024 producing only nickel cobalt manganese aluminum batteries, which has allowed GM to produce vehicles capable of exceeding 300 miles of range on a charge. General Motors produces the gas-powered Cadillac XT5 the XT6 at its Spring Hill Assembly Plant, as well as the all-electric Cadillac Lyriq.

The other plant co-operated with General Motors in Warren, Ohio, will continue producing cells with nickel cobalt manganese aluminum chemistry, LG Energy Solution said.

“At GM, we’re innovating battery technology to deliver the best mix of range, performance and affordability to our EV customers,” Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, said in a statement. “This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio.”

Conversion of battery cell lines at Spring Hill to produce the new battery cells will begin later this year. LG Energy Solution said commercial production of the lithium iron phosphate batteries is expected by late 2027.

In addition to the two plants jointly operated with General Motors, LG Energy Solution has six other manufacturing facilities operating or under construction in the United States. LG Energy Solution also operates a Honda joint venture in Jeffersonville, Ohio, and a Hyundai Motor Co. facility in Savannah, Georgia.

LG Energy Solution plans to launch production of a new battery chemistry, called lithium manganese-rich batteries, in the U.S. by 2028 in partnership with General Motors. The company has not yet announced a production location for that type of battery.

Producing multiple battery types in the same facility allows GM the flexibility to better handle shifts in electric vehicle demand, producing the best option for its broad electric vehicle portfolio, according to Stephanie Brinley, associate director of Auto Intelligence at S&P Global Mobility.

“In concept, it’s not unlike putting the right engine under the right hood,” she said. “For the vehicle that the consumer is looking for, they’re getting the battery with the best combination of range, power and price for the application.”

The current battery chemistry offers high range and performance, perfect for vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq and Vistiq. The LFP chemistry is less expensive and still gives the range it needs, Brinley said, whereas the future battery chemistry ― lithium manganese-rich batteries ― will benefit production of large trucks and SUVs.

With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) now signed into law, industries and their trade associations are either finding much in it to like, or not. So what’s in it for the offshore industry? More for offshore oil and gas than for offshore wind.

“This is a major milestone for the Gulf of America,” said National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) president Erik Milito. “With President Trump’s signature, OBBBA will restore certainty to the offshore oil and gas leasing process, bringing back the predictability that unlocks investment, protects affordable energy, and strengthens our national security.

“Energy security is national security. And energy affordability impacts every American household. When Gulf of America lease sales disappear, so do the jobs, investment, and energy production that lift communities from Louisiana to Pennsylvania and across all 50 states. The Gulf of America provisions in OBBBA reverse that trend, creating the stability needed to support long-term growth.

“These provisions reestablish a dependable offshore leasing program that drives economic activity, supports critical U.S. supply chains, sustains good-paying jobs nationwide, and delivers meaningful funding for conservation and coastal resilience. A strong Gulf of America means a stronger economy and a more secure energy future for the entire nation.

“At the same time, work remains to ensure business certainty and predictability to power America. Recent changes to the tax code continue to create unnecessary headwinds for offshore wind and for the shipbuilders, ports, and manufacturers that support it. Offshore wind is part of the solution to surging power demand and to our global competitiveness with China. NOIA will keep working with both parties to build support for stronger tax certainty and to advance lasting, broad-based permitting reform. Tackling these issues will benefit the full breadth of the American economy.

“With OBBBA becoming law, we have a strong foundation for continued Gulf of America energy leadership.”

OFFSHORE WIND

With the passage of OBBA, says the Oceantic Network, offshore wind projects must either start construction by mid-2026 or finish construction by the end of 2027 to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, substantially scaling back current policy that kept these credits in place until the next decade. The final bill also includes improvements to the newly created FEOC (Foreign-Entity of Concern) supply chain reporting requirements for tax credit eligibility over earlier drafts, and removed the heavily publicized excise tax the Senate had earlier proposed.

“America needs all the power it can get, but Washington chose to compound our national energy crisis by deprioritizing domestic clean energy production and manufacturing, which will eventually lead to higher energy prices and fewer American jobs,” said Oceantic Network president Liz Burdock.

“While this fight is over, I’m incredibly proud of Oceantic’s members and staff — they worked hard, advocated even harder, and made a difference when it mattered most,” said Burdock. “Because of their relentless push, developers now have one year to start construction and retain 100% of their tax credits, with a simple ‘safe harbor’ option. Offshore wind remains a tool to address our nation’s surging energy demand and rising energy costs while driving economic growth. Now we double down and keep fighting for stable policies that let clean energy keep building.”",https://www.marinelog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/offshore-oil-rig.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:30:31.203365

Panasonic is investing $4 billion and already has hired approximately 1,000 staff at the De Soto plant.
“Panasonic’s state-of-the-art EV battery plant marks a bright new era in Kansas,” Governor Laura Kelly said.
“The opening of our Kansas factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said.
“This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas.","Governor Laura Kelly and Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland along with many federal and state dignitaries today celebrated with Panasonic Energy the grand opening of the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing plant in the United States. Panasonic is investing $4 billion and already has hired approximately 1,000 staff at the De Soto plant.

“Panasonic’s state-of-the-art EV battery plant marks a bright new era in Kansas,” Governor Laura Kelly said. “The monumental effort that has gone into every aspect of this project has culminated in this historic day as the plant begins mass production of EV batteries. It’s hard to overstate what Panasonic’s investment means to Kansas and the value of the partnership that made it possible.”

The De Soto plant is the largest economic development project in company history — and Kansas history. An estimated $2.5 billion in new economic activity in Kansas will be generated annually by the project.

“The opening of our Kansas factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said. “This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas. Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains, and nurturing the next generation of battery talent. This facility represents not only our commitment to the region but also a foundation for long-term collaboration and innovation in the U.S.”

The project is expected to create up to 4,000 new jobs and significantly boost the regional and state economy, supporting an estimated 4,000 additional jobs created by suppliers and community businesses and 16,500 construction jobs, as cited in an independent Wichita State University economic impact study.

“Kansas leaders did the equivalent of kicking down doors and leaping over tall buildings to win this $4 billion investment by Panasonic,” Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland said. “This is a once-in-a-generation move that will power our economy, support thousands of Kansas families and spark opportunity for decades to come. It’s bold. It’s historic. And all Kansans can feel pride today in seeing that our state can do big things again, and that our best days are ahead of us.”

The 300-acre manufacturing plant, which is opening almost three years to the date of the initial announcement, is located in De Soto’s Astra Enterprise Park. The state-of-the-art facility will operate and produce approximately 66 lithium-ion batteries per second. Its infrastructure is broken into two wings, with four battery lines on each wing. At the end of both wings, infrastructure is designed for shipping, packing, and sub-supply vendor spaces for Panasonic partners.

“Panasonic’s new state-of-the-art facility in De Soto is a milestone for our state and a testament to Kansas’ talented workforce and leadership in energy production and innovation,” U.S. Senator Jerry Moran said. “I commend the leadership of Panasonic for choosing the Sunflower State for its U.S. manufacturing site, creating thousands of quality jobs for Kansans and drawing new people to the Midwest. With this investment, we are continuing to make certain Kansas remains a place where the next generation – with their knowledge and talent – can stay and build a future.”",https://www.kansascommerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC02535.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:27:27.603460

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors is planning to produce lower-cost battery cells at its joint-venture plant with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution in Tennessee.

The Detroit automaker is rolling out production of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, a technology that is gaining popularity at other automakers in the U.S. including at cross-town rival Ford Motor. GM will begin converting battery cell lines at its Spring Hill, Tennessee facility later this year, and commercial production is expected to begin by late 2027, the company said Monday.

GM and other automakers have pulled back some of their goals around electric vehicle production as demand for the models has been weaker-than-anticipated. Still, auto companies are investing billions in future battery technology and EV production facilities, with the expectation that shoppers will eventually make the switch from traditional gasoline vehicles.

GM currently produces nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum cells at the factory, and will continue to do so at a plant in Ohio. The cells produced in Tennessee are used for EVs made at the neighboring assembly plant, including the Cadillac Lyriq. The factory employs about 1,300 people, GM said. Workers at the Ultium Cells joint-venture factory earlier this year approved their first contract with the United Auto Workers union.

Ford is planning to produce LFP batteries at a factory in Michigan using technology from Chinese battery giant CATL. The plant, announced in 2023, has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company. It is expected to begin production in 2026.

Both automakers are also working on production of lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistries, which are intended to provide drivers with more mileage on their EVs before needing to charge. Concerns around battery range, as well as high vehicle prices, are some of the top barriers keeping customers from buying electric vehicles, auto executives have said.

We see the ideal energy mix as a combination of large nuclear power plants, small modular reactors and renewable energy sources.

Great British Energy - Nuclear is aiming to allocate a site later this year and connect projects to the grid in the mid-2030s.","British workers will further benefit from a new generation of nuclear power, as the government signs a landmark agreement with Czechia to kickstart the next chapter in the UK’s golden age of nuclear and secure high-skilled jobs.

Today’s agreement, set to be signed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala at Downing Street, will unlock new opportunities for industrial collaboration and the potential for the UK and Czechia to export small modular reactors to other countries in Europe.

It will also support the delivery of up to six new reactors in Czechia by Rolls-Royce SMR, potentially worth billions of pounds.

It comes after Rolls Royce SMR and the Czechia’s largest public company, ČEZ, agreed last year to partner on SMR, with ČEZ acquiring a 20% stake.

The leaders will also host a business roundtable as part of the visit to drive closer trade and investment links between the UK and Czechia to support working people.

Building more nuclear will help drive the UK’s energy security, as part of the government’s mission to protect family finances by replacing the UK’s dependency on fossil fuel markets controlled by dictators with clean power that we control.

Small modular reactors are also smaller and quicker to build than traditional nuclear plants, with costs likely to come down as units are rolled out, helping to delivering clean, homegrown energy for British billpayers.

The government’s clean energy mission is the only route to energy security, lower bills and good jobs for the country. Investment is already booming, with over £40 billion of private investment in clean energy announced since last July.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

This agreement is about delivering for Britain - cleaner energy, better jobs, and greater security.

By working with our Czech partners on small modular reactors, we’re backing British engineering, strengthening our industrial base, and putting the UK in a leading position to export the technologies of the future.

This is our Plan for Change in action, taking practical steps to rebuild our economy, bring down bills, and give working people a stake in our clean energy transition.

Peter Fiala, Prime Minister of Czechia, said:

Nuclear energy holds significant potential for the coming years, as the sector is undergoing a true renaissance. That is why I am especially pleased that ČEZ and Rolls-Royce will cooperate on the development and production of small modular reactors. This collaboration will bring tangible benefits to both Czech and British economies, including job creation.

The Czech Republic and the United Kingdom share a common approach to energy policy, and we have a very similar vision of what the future of energy should look like. We see the ideal energy mix as a combination of large nuclear power plants, small modular reactors and renewable energy sources.

I am confident that this partnership with the United Kingdom will help us ensure energy security and affordable energy for future generations — a key priority of our government.

UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

This government is driving to make the UK a clean energy superpower, replacing our dependence on fossil fuel markets controlled by petrostates with clean homegrown power we control.

Nuclear power is an essential part of that, which is why this government is ending years of a no-nuclear status quo to seize the benefits of a nuclear golden age for Britain.

This agreement will put the UK back where it belongs – at the very forefront of the global race on nuclear, working in lockstep with our Czech partners to deliver economic growth, clean energy and highly-skilled jobs for both nations.

According to the International Energy Agency, the global SMR market is projected to reach up to nearly £500 billion by 2050, with today’s announcement giving the UK and Czechia the competitive advantage as frontrunners in the global race to build and export new nuclear technology.

This follows Rolls-Royce SMR being selected as the preferred bidder to partner with Great British Energy – Nuclear to develop small modular reactors, subject to final government approvals and contract signature – unlocking a new golden age of nuclear in the UK.

As part of the government’s modern Industrial Strategy to revive Britain’s industrial heartlands, the government has pledged over £2.5 billion for the overall small modular reactor programme – with this project potentially supporting up to 3,000 new skilled jobs and powering the equivalent of around 3 million homes with clean, secure homegrown energy.

Great British Energy - Nuclear is aiming to allocate a site later this year and connect projects to the grid in the mid-2030s. Once small modular reactors and Sizewell C come online in the 2030s, combined with the new station at Hinkley Point C, this will deliver more nuclear to the grid than over the previous half century.

Last week, during the President Macron’s State Visit to the UK, French energy giant EDF confirmed it will take a 12.5% stake in Sizewell C, taking the project one step closer to being given the green light. At peak construction, Sizewell C will support 10,000 jobs, and thousands more in the nationwide supply chain, and create 1,500 apprenticeships.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68752d7c352c290d20dcae10/s960_GFX2507-073_MOU_960_v1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:28:23.416940

Without a steady supply, the entire U.S. EV and renewable energy roadmap could be in jeopardy.

In 2024, MP launched its state-of-the-art Independence Parkway facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The site plans to produce about 1,000 metric tons of finished NdFeB magnets each year, starting to increase production slowly in late 2025. The facility will supply magnets to General Motors and other companies, using raw materials from Mountain Pass, MP Materials’ mine and processing plant in California.

It’s a major milestone, making MP the only U.S. company with a fully integrated supply chain from mine to magnet.

From Mine to Magnet: MP Materials Powers a Low-Emission Future

MP Materials is redefining rare earth production with sustainability at its core. Its Mountain Pass site—America’s only integrated rare earth facility combines mining, beneficiation, and processing in one location. This streamlined setup significantly cuts transport emissions and boosts operational efficiency.

The company’s sustainability report revealed that it follows California’s AB 32 Global Warming Solutions Act, which mandates the purchase of emissions allowances. These funds support the state’s climate programs. While overall greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2023 due to expansion, MP remains committed to reducing its carbon intensity by adopting cleaner energy and improving processes.

Its sustainable strategy is backed by real progress:

Water Conservation: Achieved a 95% water recycling rate during beneficiation.

Waste Reduction: Utilizes closed-loop systems to minimize hazardous waste.

Independent Recognition: Earned a Bronze Medal from EcoVadis and completed an IRMA Verified self-assessment.

Life Cycle Research: Ongoing studies aim to lower cradle-to-gate environmental impacts.

Clean Compliance: Reported zero environmental violations in 2023.

A 2023 German government study even ranked MP’s environmental performance above global peers, especially in water efficiency and climate-related metrics, placing it at the forefront of sustainable rare earth mining.

Greener Magnet Manufacturing

MP’s approach extends beyond extraction. It has developed cutting-edge, low-impact techniques to produce high-performance magnets:

Molten Salt Electrolysis: Converts rare earth oxides into pure metals efficiently.

Strip Casting: Blends rare earths with other metals to form magnet-ready alloys.

Pressing & Sintering: Shapes alloy powders into powerful magnetic blocks.

Precision Finishing: Enhances magnetic properties while reducing material waste.

Recycling Innovation: Invests in systems to recover rare earth materials and close the loop.

By focusing on cleaner production and recycling, MP Materials is setting new standards for responsible magnet manufacturing. Its integrated and innovation-driven model supports both national security and the clean energy transition, proving that rare earth production can be both powerful and planet-friendly.

Green Finance in Action

In 2021, MP Materials issued $672.3 million in green bonds, fully allocated to climate-aligned projects under its Green Financing Framework. The funds supported efforts in:

Sustainable water management

Renewable energy adoption

Energy-efficient production equipment

Eco-efficient product innovation

The framework aligns with the International Capital Market Association’s Green Bond Principles and reflects MP’s long-term ESG vision. By investing in cleaner systems now, MP is building a greener supply chain that delivers environmental and economic value.

Carbon Credit Potential

MP’s operations have real carbon credit relevance. By ending rare earth concentrate shipments to China and moving processing onshore, it is cutting off transoceanic shipping emissions. This not only lowers carbon footprints for its customers but also qualifies MP’s supply chain for lifecycle carbon savings.

Their integrated approach at Mountain Pass helps conserve water (95% recycled), minimize hazardous waste, and reduce emissions across the value chain. The company’s recycling-first mindset further adds to the emissions-cutting potential of every magnet it sells.

MP Materials Stock (NYSE: MP): A Rare Investment Opportunity

MP Materials is right now the cornerstone of America’s clean energy future. As demand grows for EVs, wind power, and defense tech, it is supplying the rare earth magnets that power low-carbon innovation.

The MP Materials Corp. stock [NYSE: MP] jumped nearly 51% to close at $45.23 on 10th July and continued to climb early Friday, reaching an intraday high of $50.98 before settling slightly down 0.3% to $45.09 at the close.

This surge on Thursday and Friday brought MP Materials’ stock to its highest level in about three years, dating back to early 2022. The precise reasons were:

Strategic Deal with U.S. Department of Defense (DoD): A $400 million equity stake and $150 million loan from the DoD will help expand Mountain Pass. The Pentagon will also become MP’s largest shareholder and a guaranteed buyer of magnets for 10 years at a set price of $110/kg.

“10X Facility” by 2028: This new site will produce 10,000 metric tons of magnets per year, making MP the backbone of U.S. clean-tech and defense manufacturing.

U.S.-China Decoupling: MP cut off concentrate exports to China. Instead, it’s focusing on supply agreements with the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, fortifying energy security.

Revenue Growth in Q1 2025

Total revenue rose 25% year over year to $60.8 million in Q1 2025, driven by higher production of separated products like NdPr oxide and metal. For the first time, revenue from magnetic precursor sales was recognized in early 2025. Meanwhile, rare earth concentrate sales dropped as more material was refined into higher-value products.

Highlights include a record 563 metric tons of NdPr produced, a 36% increase, and strong REO production at 12,213 metric tons, up 10% from last year. NdPr sales more than doubled to 464 metric tons. The Magnetics division made its first metal deliveries, generating $5.2 million in revenue with positive adjusted EBITDA.

MP’s current financials reflect the cost of rapid scaling, with a current operating margin of -53.88%. At the end of 2024, it was -45.79%. It’s mostly due to declining revenue from China. Nonetheless, experts believe that this is a long-term play.

With strong support from the Pentagon and growing U.S. efforts to secure critical minerals, MP is positioned to lead in rare earth production for years to come. For carbon credit and ESG-focused investors, it offers something rare: real emissions impact, a green supply chain, and alignment with national priorities. It’s a rare opportunity in every sense.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2459899907.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:28:26.485796

With the repeal of CEQ’s NEPA regulations, individual agencies are now responsible for developing their own NEPA procedures.
Mitigation and Benefits Under the New Procedures The treatment of mitigation and the benefits of proposed actions have also evolved under the revised NEPA procedures.
Army Corps of Engineers: The Army Corps took somewhat of a different approach to its NEPA updates.
Unlike FERC and USDA, DOD’s NEPA guidance still retains the definition of “connected action” from previous CEQ NEPA regulations.","On July 3, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC” or the “Commission”), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Army Corps”), and the Departments of Energy (“DOE”), Interior (“DOI”), Transportation (“DOT”), Agriculture (“USDA”), and Defense (“DOD”) released sweeping updates to their regulations and procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). These changes come on the heels of the Council on Environmental Quality’s (“CEQ”) interim final rule in February 2025 rescinding its agency-wide NEPA regulations. These changes also follow the Supreme Court’s decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition vs. Eagle County, Colorado (“Seven County”) on May 29, 2025, which reinforced the ability of agencies to establish reasonable limits on the scope of their environmental reviews. The procedures as a whole are more concise than the regulations they replace and hew closely to the first Trump administration’s 2020 NEPA reforms and reflect a government-wide preference for a guidance-based approach to implementing NEPA. Whether projects will actually benefit from the narrowed scope of effects that must be considered during environmental review and the focus on a quicker overall process will ultimately depend on how courts respond in the inevitable challenges to the initial wave of agency actions done under these new procedures. These new procedures largely narrow the scope of effects that must be considered during, and seek to shorten the time period for preparing, environmental reviews, which may help streamline permitting but come at the cost of additional litigation risk.

The following article covers the comprehensive overhaul of federal NEPA procedures announced on July 3, 2025. We examine the narrowing scope of NEPA review, the shift towards guidance-driven NEPA implementation, and the increased agency discretion and case-by-case analysis permitted under these new procedures. We also explore the implications of these changes for permitting efficiency and litigation risk, as well as CEQ’s evolving role. In addition, we highlight the new treatment of mitigation and benefits analysis under the revised NEPA framework, the current status of NEPA rulemaking and projects already undergoing environmental reviews, and notable agency-specific approaches.

The Changing Scope of NEPA Reviews

An important issue teed up by the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Seven County is how much deference agencies are entitled in establishing their new NEPA policies and procedures. Some of the abovementioned agencies tackled this issue head-on: for example, DOE cites Seven County directly multiple times throughout its new NEPA implementing procedures, underscoring that, under that case, the agency is owed “substantial deference” in NEPA cases. USDA and DOI echo this “substantial deference” point from Seven County in their interim final rules. As we discussed previously, agencies’ efforts to expressly incorporate principles espoused in Seven County likely foreshadow a narrower basis for success in challenges to the sufficiency and scope of an agency’s NEPA review.

The revised NEPA procedures lean into the Supreme Court’s holding in Seven County, allowing agencies to narrow the scope of activities and impacts that need to be considered in their environmental reviews. Under the prior CEQ regulations, agencies were required to evaluate the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the proposed action, which caused, in some instances, agencies to consider potential effects that were very far afield of those related to the proposed project. The revised NEPA procedures do not preserve this framework. Instead, citing to Seven County, agencies are signaling that they need not consider impacts that are “remote in time, geographically remote, or the product of a lengthy causal chain,” or are those that “the agency has no ability to prevent due to the limits of its regulatory authority, or that would occur regardless of the proposed action, or that would need to be initiated by a third party.” These measures also build on Congress’s efforts to streamline environmental reviews. While provisions that would have curtailed judicial review ultimately did not make it into the final version, the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” signed into law on July 4, 2025, allows project proponents to pay a fee in exchange for expedited NEPA review. Once paid, an agency has six months to prepare an environmental assessment and one year for an environmental impact statement.1

Seven County’s pronouncements likewise impact the cumulative impacts analysis, which is frequently a core claim in NEPA litigation and has been a matter of controversy across recent presidential administrations. NEPA does not expressly mandate consideration of cumulative impacts. Prior to 2020, agencies needed to consider the cumulative effects — the incremental effects of an action when considering other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions — on the environment. When the first Trump administration overhauled CEQ’s NEPA regulations in 2020, it removed the definition of “cumulative effects,” instead directing agencies to assess the “reasonably foreseeable environmental trends and planned actions in the area(s).” The Biden administration returned to the old definition, which the current Trump administration has repealed as part of the February 2025 rescission of all CEQ regulations.

Now, similar to the 2020 rule, nearly every agency’s guidance documents are devoid of any mention of cumulative impacts.2 Whether agencies and project proponents can focus solely on a project’s direct effects, viewed in isolation, will be tested in litigation, with the closest calls being where project challengers can identify those other impacts (e.g., indirect impacts) that may occur at the same time and place as the project at hand and are within the agency’s power to regulate. Litigants have argued that an agency’s evaluation of the effects of an action should be viewed in context, not a vacuum, and some reviewing courts may be sympathetic to similar claims based on a general sense of how they think NEPA should operate, or based on a remnant understanding of NEPA reviews under the now-rescinded CEQ regulations or case law based upon those rescinded regulations.

The Pivot from Regulations to Guidance and Case-by-Case Analysis

While each agency has taken a slightly different approach to NEPA procedures, the government-wide overhaul of NEPA-implementing regulations is representative of a pivot from reliance on regulations promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking to a guidance-based approach. DOE, DOI, and DOD repealed nearly all of their regulations implementing NEPA in favor of concise guidance documents. Others, like FERC and DOT, retain some formal regulations supplemented by new guidance documents. This approach may, in part, reflect a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that CEQ lacked authority to issue NEPA regulations that are binding on agencies.

Agencies relying on guidance documents rather than notice-and-comment rulemaking has important implications for NEPA reviews beyond the current administration. To be sure, a guidance-only approach provides an agency with greater discretion that can be used to streamline permitting, especially for large infrastructure projects whose environmental reviews have been delayed. This aligns with the Trump administration’s Unleashing American Energy executive order that, as we discussed previously, directs agencies to identify ways to reduce delay. However, future administrations with different policy priorities can use this same flexibility to re-expand the scope of reviews and re-encumber the NEPA process with minimal formal process and public engagement. Indeed, several agencies noted the “flexibility to respond to new developments” and the ability to “rapidly update [guidance] in response to future court decisions . . . or Presidential directives”3 as justification for adopting a guidance-based approach. This may result in a much more pronounced swing of the pendulum by giving future administrations an easier pathway to revising how an agency implements NEPA to accommodate different policy priorities, such as by assessing the effects of climate change and impacts on environmental justice communities.

As with other aspects of these new NEPA policies, the agencies have different approaches to establishing the scope of their case-by-case NEPA flexibility. Some guidance documents indicate substantial latitude in deviating from the guidance and assessing NEPA matters on an individual basis. For instance, DOE describes its new procedures as “non-binding guidance,” and under those procedures, “DOE retains the discretion to adopt approaches on a case-by-case basis that differ from those described in the[] procedures where appropriate.” Page 1 of FERC’s new staff guidance manual, meanwhile, indicates that seemingly-mandatory language like “will” actually means something is “routine practice” rather than something that will definitely occur. On the other hand, some agency materials appear to offer less flexibility; DOI, for instance, plainly states that its guidance establishes the procedures it “will” follow in undertaking NEPA reviews.

CEQ’s Changing Role

CEQ has historically played a central role in shaping the NEPA process, primarily by promulgating regulations that federal agencies would incorporate and supplement to accommodate their various programs and procedures. With the repeal of CEQ’s NEPA regulations, individual agencies are now responsible for developing their own NEPA procedures. Despite this additional step toward decentralization, CEQ remains influential: Section 102 of NEPA still requires agencies to consult with CEQ when developing their regulations, and many agencies continue to rely heavily on CEQ’s guidance, particularly when establishing categorical exclusions or revising procedures during emergencies.

Recent developments underscore CEQ’s continued, albeit more consultative, influence. The impact of CEQ’s guidance is evident in the structure and language of new agency procedures, many of which closely mirror leaked CEQ draft guidance released in April of this year. DOI and DOD adopted this guidance almost verbatim, while others, such as FERC, DOE, and USDA, produced similar but more detailed or tailored procedures. In addition to the leaked guidance document, many of the revised NEPA procedures closely resemble the CEQ regulations as they existed in 2020 under the first Trump administration, though there are some interesting differences. For example, FERC’s new guidance document does not discuss the concept of “connected action,” which has been the subject of many disputes over the scope of agency review, and whether two actions need to be considered in the same document. In contrast, DOI, DOE, DOT, and DOD still retain the concept of “connected actions” in their guidance. Overall, this approach delivers quicker clarity in the short-term but adds potential longer-term uncertainty, as a new administration could more easily replace that guidance to advance its own policy priorities.

Mitigation and Benefits Under the New Procedures

The treatment of mitigation and the benefits of proposed actions have also evolved under the revised NEPA procedures. One of the controversial revisions in the Biden-era NEPA Phase 2 revisions to CEQ’s regulations was a prohibition on an agency considering any mitigation measures that were not enforceable — typically through permit conditions or binding agreements. The new procedures allow agencies to once again consider voluntary or otherwise foreseeable mitigation measures in their environmental documents, even if those measures are not enforceable.

Similarly, the approach to evaluating the benefits of proposed actions has shifted. Under the prior CEQ regulations, agencies were required to identify an “environmentally preferred alternative” that maximized environmental benefits, including those related to climate change or environmental justice. The revised procedures eliminate this requirement, instead directing agencies to consider both beneficial and adverse effects or impacts in their analysis.

What’s Next for NEPA Rulemaking?

The federal agencies took varying approaches to engaging with the public in issuing their new NEPA policies and procedures. For instance, some agencies (including DOI, DOE, USDA, and DOT) issued interim final rules (or, in the case of DOT, a notice of availability) on their new NEPA policies and are soliciting public comments — a procedure which they have emphasized is voluntary and not required. Comments to DOI, DOE, DOT, and the Army Corps are due on August 4, 2025, while USDA is accepting comments until July 30, 2025. With the exception of FERC, whose rule changes go into effect on August 18, 2025, and DOD, whose guidance became effective on June 30, 2025, changes from all other agencies were effective on July 3, 2025.

In justifying their decisions to not go through full notice and comment rulemaking, these agencies largely rely on Seven County’s statement that NEPA is not a substantive statute, as well as several exceptions and exemptions under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), including for “rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice,” interpretative rules, policy statements, and “good cause.”

Meanwhile, other agencies, including DOD and FERC, issued a public notice or final rule for which no public comment period was provided. Similar to the first group of agencies, FERC relied on the APA’s “good cause” exemption. This expansive use of APA exceptions to notice-and-comment rulemaking — particularly on the basis that NEPA is a procedural statute with no substantive constraints on agency action — signals that agencies will likely continue to make full use of APA exceptions to incorporate new directives and policy priorities. However, transitioning away from more formal notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures creates additional litigation risk for projects which may be permitted under such rules and procedures, but also allows a future administration to more easily change these procedures to suit its own policy objectives.

These changes have important implications for projects currently undergoing NEPA review. DOI and DOT have affirmed that the new procedures will not apply to projects that are “sufficiently advanced,” and the Army Corps stated that its revised procedures will have “no effect” on ongoing NEPA reviews where the Army Corps “has determined [its existing procedures] will continue to apply to existing applications.”4 For others, however, changes may impact ongoing projects — DOE, for instance, stated that its policy considerations “drastically outweigh[]” any claimed reliance interest in preexisting procedures.5 FERC’s updates are silent on the impact to ongoing projects.

Agency Highlights

Although there is significant overlap among each agency’s NEPA procedures, we’ve highlighted below some of the interesting nuances from each:

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission:

FERC retains all of its existing NEPA regulations with only minor revisions aimed at removing references to the now-repealed CEQ regulations and replacing them with references to statutory language. FERC is also the only agency whose changes do not go into effect immediately.

Neither FERC’s rulemaking nor its procedures reference Seven County or implement the Supreme Court’s holding into the scope of effects the Commission must analyze. FERC also retains its requirement that staff should assess a project’s cumulative effects.

FERC also emphasized that staff will generally not require “the development of new methodologies” to inform its analyses unless essential. This may be seen as addressing the dispute about whether an agency must use methodologies like the social cost of greenhouse gases, which the Trump administration has moved to eliminate.

Army Corps of Engineers:

The Army Corps took somewhat of a different approach to its NEPA updates. Instead of publishing a guidance document, the Army Corps used an interim final rule to rescind its NEPA regulations for permit applications under the Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act (including those in 33 C.F.R. Part 325, Appendix B) and to replace them with a new part in its regulations — Part 333. Notably, the Army Corps will also conduct its reviews under Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (known as “Section 408”) under the new regulations governing the Army Corps’ regulatory program.

The Army Corps also separately took action to rescind nearly all regulations implementing its civil works program while maintaining the regulations related to categorical exclusions. Instead, the Army Corps stated that it will proceed according to DOD’s NEPA procedures.

Department of Energy:

DOE explains that, as part of its process for “evaluating significance” (e.g., for establishing categorial exemptions, determining whether to prepare an environmental assessment or EIS), DOE “should evaluate environmental effects in context,” which may provide an avenue for the agency to consider the cumulative impacts of an action. DOE Implementing Procedures § 3.2(e).

Department of the Interior:

Despite being labeled as guidance, DOI’s NEPA handbook uses mostly mandatory language and reads much like a rule rather than non-binding guidance. This, combined with DOI’s statement that the handbook governs the way bureaus under the DOI will implement NEPA, may leave DOI’s environmental review open to challenges under the APA on the grounds that it constitutes rulemaking without notice and comment.

While DOI rescinded most of its NEPA regulations, it retained those related to emergency responses, categorical exclusions, and applicant- and contractor-prepared NEPA documents.

Department of Transportation:

DOT’s NEPA-related actions encompass multiple actions, including: publishing its new NEPA order, see generally DOT Order 5610.1D; revising several operating administrations’ (“OA”) NEPA regulations together, see generally 90 Fed. Reg. at 29,426; separately rescinding one OA’s NEPA regulations, see 90 Fed. Reg. at 29,507; and separately publishing policies and procedures for NEPA compliance for another OA, the Federal Aviation Administration, see FAA Order 1050.1G. While some agencies undertook single, more unified actions (e.g., DOE), these DOT efforts constitute multiple actions that range from single-OA specific regulations to an agency-wide order.

Department of Agriculture:

Like the Army Corps, USDA chose to approach its NEPA updates by rescinding all of its existing NEPA regulations and promulgating new ones via an interim final rule. This also included rescinding all of the NEPA regulations for the subcomponents at USDA, such as the U.S. Forest Service. This new approach allows USDA to establish consistency across its various subcomponents. USDA did not release guidance along with its interim final rule like the other agencies.

For environmental review regarding the disbursement of funds, USDA requires that the agency complete its environmental review process prior to issuing the funding, except for infrastructure projects where USDA determines that it is necessary to assure the funds will be available for community health, safety, or economic development.

Department of Defense:

The Army, Navy, and Air Force all rescinded their NEPA implementing regulations via separate interim final rules.

Unlike FERC and USDA, DOD’s NEPA guidance still retains the definition of “connected action” from previous CEQ NEPA regulations. However, DOD’s guidance states that a federal action must be within the authority of DOD to be considered a “connected action,” and thus does not reach non-DOD, cross-agency actions.

1 By contrast, the Fiscal Responsibility Act amendments to NEPA, incorporated into the agencies’ procedures, set a deadline of one year for environmental assessments and two years for environmental impact statements.

2 FERC’s regulations still require the Commission to assess cumulative impacts. 18 C.F.R. § 380.12(b)(3).

In Inhance Technologies, L.L.C.","Note by Carolyn E. Young

When is “new” just old news? The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of “new” leaves the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wondering what it can regulate anew. For over forty years, Inhance Technologies, L.L.C. (Inhance) has used the same fluorination process to enhance the chemical resistance of plastic containers. In 2020, the EPA promulgated a Significant New Use Rule for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of chemicals now known for their environmental persistence and potential health risks. This Significant New Use Rule required that any uses of PFAS not identified as ongoing before the rule's promulgation be regulated as “significant new use[s]” under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)'s Section 5. As part of the rulemaking process, the EPA identified industries likely to be affected by the regulation to provide notice of anticipated regulatory impacts. At the time, the EPA was unaware that the fluorination process employed by companies such as Inhance unintentionally produced PFAS and therefore did not include the fluorination industry on this list. It was not until 2022 that the EPA discovered that Inhance's fluorination process unintentionally created *914 PFAS. Upon this discovery, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation to Inhance, informing the company that its fluorination process now qualified as a “significant new use” and offered two options: Either change the process to eliminate PFAS or temporarily halt production. Inhance ignored the orders and instead submitted two Significant New Use Notices in December 2022 to seek EPA approval for its existing process.

In December 2023, after considering the Significant New Use Notices, the EPA issued two orders under Sections 5(e) and 5(f) of the TSCA that prohibited Inhance from continuing its fluorination process until further testing assessed the risks associated with PFAS. In response, Inhance petitioned Fifth Circuit for judicial review, arguing that the EPA's orders exceeded its statutory authority under TSCA's Section 5, a provision that explicitly governs new chemical substances or significant new uses. The company argued that its process, in operation for four decades, did not qualify as a “new” use subject to EPA regulation under Section 5. In response, the EPA claimed that a “significant new use” refers to any use not previously known to the agency, asserting that Inhance's failure to disclose its process during the 2020 rulemaking process justified regulating it under Section 5.

In Inhance Technologies, L.L.C. v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the EPA could not retroactively classify a forty-year-old manufacturing process as a ““new” use simply because it had only recently discovered its environmental risks. The court's decision limits the EPA's regulatory authority to decide what constitutes a “significant new use” under Section 5 of the TSCA, establishing that preexisting chemical processes can only be subject to regulation under the appropriate procedural safeguards provided by TSCA's Section 6. The Fifth Circuit's decision misinterprets the TSCA by overemphasizing the role of cost considerations under Section 6, contrary to Congress's intent in the 2016 TSCA amendments that prioritize unreasonable risk over economic concerns. Part II provides an overview of the TSCA's statutory *915 framework, focusing on the distinctions between Sections 5 and 6 and the EPA's regulatory history under Section 6. Part III discusses the Fifth Circuit's decision that the EPA exceeded its authority under Section 5 of the TSCA and its clarification that Section 6 is the appropriate mechanism for regulating established chemical uses.

If EV growth continues to slow down, there’s also an increasing risk of battery manufacturing overcapacity, an issue already plaguing China’s battery industry.

Tesla is Panasonic's largest customer, and local production will help protect the batteries from tariffs and global trade tensions.

The 2170 cylindrical cells made in De Soto will have more energy capacity, the company claims.

Tesla battery supplier Panasonic Energy on Monday inaugurated what it claims will be the world’s largest electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility when fully complete. Located just outside Kansas City in De Soto, Kansas, the 4.7-million-square-foot plant is roughly the size of 225 football fields and marks a major expansion of Panasonic’s U.S. manufacturing footprint.

It’s the company’s second battery facility in the U.S., following the Sparks, Nevada, plant it operates within the Tesla Gigafactory campus. While the Nevada site has been producing cells since 2017, the new $4 billion De Soto plant will boost Panasonic’s total U.S. battery production capacity to 73 gigawatt-hours once fully operational.

Panasonic says the Kansas facility will be 20% more productive than its Nevada plant. It will manufacture 2170 cylindrical cells with 5% more energy capacity. When fully operational, the plant will be able to churn out 70 cells per second—more than six million per day.

While Panasonic touts the De Soto facility as the world’s largest of its kind, that distinction likely refers to its physical size. In terms of battery production capacity, competitors like LG Energy Solution, BYD and CATL operate far larger factories or have significantly higher combined output across multiple sites.

The plant comes at a critical moment for EVs in the U.S. Trade tensions with China and generous subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act have triggered a wave of domestic battery investment, much of it concentrated in Republican states and districts. The result is thousands of new jobs and a battery manufacturing boom unlike ever before.

But while EV sales soared in recent years, growth has slowed and become uneven over the past few quarters, especially after the Trump administration took office. Some automakers are thriving, but Tesla is losing ground. If EV growth continues to slow down, there’s also an increasing risk of battery manufacturing overcapacity, an issue already plaguing China’s battery industry.

Panasonic’s biggest customer, Tesla, has seen global sales decline due to an aging lineup, Elon Musk’s increasingly controversial political activities and a pivot toward AI and robotics. According to local Japanese media reports, Panasonic initially planned to maximize production at the new Kansas plant by March 2027. Those plans are now delayed. A proposed third U.S. battery plant has also been put on hold amid weaker demand for Teslas and reduced federal support for EVs.

Still, the De Soto factory should help future-proof America’s EV industry and will also help Panasonic diversify its customer base.

The company already supplies batteries to the EV startup Lucid and has also entered agreements with Mazda. The plant is also the largest economic development project in Kansas history; it will add 4,000 direct high-paying manufacturing jobs and a total of 8,000 jobs from suppliers and related industries. That’s in addition to 4,000 workers Panasonic already employs in Nevada.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/zxA124/s1/panasonic-kansas-battery-factory.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:27:31.587186

GM EV sales are a distant second to Tesla.
For the first six months of 2025, Tesla sold 255,000 in the U.S., down 13% from first half of 2024.
“There’s not one thing that’s causing Tesla sales to go down and GM’s to go up.
GM sold 12,736 Blazer EVs so far in 2025, up from the 7,234 it sold through June of 2024.","GM is gaining market share in electric vehicles as Tesla loses steam.

Auto analysts say aging vehicle portfolio and the political environment harmed Tesla's sales this quarter.

Tesla Inc., the No. 1 electric vehicle company in the United States, is shedding customers as public opinion soured on its polarizing billionaire CEO Elon Musk. The gap it leaves in the market is steadily filling, auto experts say, with products produced by General Motors.

The Detroit automaker accelerated electric vehicle sales and market share in the first half of the year thanks to expanded electric offerings across three of its four brands. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment for Texas-based rival Tesla cratered this spring due to criticism over Musk's hands-on involvement in Washington politics.

“GM is quietly building trust while Elon burns it,” said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis for AutoPacifi­c. “Consumers are responding to consistency, not volatility, and GM’s steady hand is starting to pay dividends.”

Though the tides shifted somewhat, the sales gulf between the American automakers remains vast. GM EV sales are a distant second to Tesla. Still, GM reported triple-digit growth in its EVs while Tesla faced a double-digit loss during that period.

Tesla said it delivered 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter globally through June, down 13% from 443,956 deliveries in the same period a year ago. Tesla does not break out deliveries by region, so sales estimates conducted by the Automotive News Data Center put Tesla's second-quarter U.S. sales around 125,000, down 16.7%. For the first six months of 2025, Tesla sold 255,000 in the U.S., down 13% from first half of 2024.

GM, meanwhile, sold 78,167 electric cars in the United States for the first half of the year, an 111% increase from midyear 2024. Of those, 46,280 were sold in the second quarter.

Through June of this year, GM’s estimated EV market share reached 13% — but it could still grow as the year progresses, and Tesla’s may yet still shrink, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

Annual sales of Tesla's lineup fell for the first time in 2024. Tesla attributed the decline to a pause in production to shift to a refreshed version of its bestselling Model Y SUV, which industry experts said would prompt customers to hold off on buying until the newer version could be rolled out.

Instead, people bought fewer Tesla vehicles.

“There’s not one thing that’s causing Tesla sales to go down and GM’s to go up. It’s a combination of factors,” Fiorani said. “Some of that will be a response to Elon Musk, some will be to the EV tax credits going away. The EV market is developing so fast, but we are still just at the beginning of the bell curve.”

Long head start

Tesla, Inc., which manufactures electric cars, batteries and solar panels, was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. PayPal cofounder Elon Musk invested $30 million into the venture and served as chair of the company before taking over as CEO shortly after its first vehicle launch, the Roadster, in 2008.

GM, on the other hand, was founded 100 years before the Roadster hit the road, and even benefited from creating the first modern electric vehicle in 1996 with the EV1, but did not rally behind wide-scale electric vehicle production until the 2010s.

Tesla’s longevity as a household name in electric vehicles may give it an advantage over larger legacy automakers like GM, but that name is losing luster amid a stagnating vehicle lineup and weaker physical footprint, Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, told the Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network. (Tesla does not use franchise dealerships and does not offer promotional discounts on its products.) Tesla hasn’t launched an all-new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023.

“Tesla has had this head start, but you see these other manufacturers launch products that resonate and engage their dealerships to sell them,” she said.

GM's sales of electric vehicles may be growing exponentially, but they still fall far short of the business the company does with gas-powered models. GM has used its multi-powertrain portfolio to its advantage.

Popularity of the gas-powered versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer likely aided sales of electric offerings, analysts contend, as consumers leaned on familiar choices. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, launched last year at $34,995, had sales of 17,420 so far this year. GM sold 12,736 Blazer EVs so far in 2025, up from the 7,234 it sold through June of 2024.

""We're all about giving our customers more choices. We made the right investments over the last few years to bring the industry’s broadest ICE and EV portfolio to market,” said GM spokeswoman Tara Kuhnen. ""We’re proud to keep driving innovation here in the U.S.”

Joe LaFeir, president of automotive insights at S&P Global Mobility, noted in a February statement announcing GM's 10th consecutive year securing the top spot for Highest Overall Manufacturer Loyalty that an automaker sporting a healthy pipeline of product offerings that appeal to a wide range of buyers encourages return sales.

Fiorani added that the more options consumers have in general, the more likely they are to find what they're looking for when brands transition to electric powertrains.

“GM has Cadillacs, and Chevrolets and GMCs spread across a number of segments,” Fiorani said. “They’re still way behind Tesla’s, but they offer choices to their customers that Tesla does not.”

Reputational damage

Musk’s role in President Donald Trump's administration leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has garnered the company negative press and customer backlash.

DOGE, Musk's brainchild, has been responsible for thousands of job cuts in the public sector, which, in turn, were blamed for inspiring mass vandalism of Teslas at dealerships and public parking lots. Videos of people keying Teslas have gone viral on social media platforms Instagram and X.

A Detroit Free Press reporter rented a Tesla in March to gauge reactions of metro Detroit residents and to connect with Tesla owners, some of whom shared that the CEO's involvement in politics added stress to their ownership and were advised by others to return the vehicle.

The true impact of Tesla’s shifting public image may yet materialize, Valdez-Streaty added, as it will take time for polarizing headlines to tangibly impact vehicle sales. She compared the change to consumer sentiment, where spending habits take time to catch up to reports of economic uncertainty.

“When it comes to data on favorability by brand, Tesla is definitely down,” she said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/02/PDTF/84453150007-2026-silveradoevtrailboss-02-r-1.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-14 14:29:45.376486

Inspections are performed by the pipeline company and pipeline regulators, according to the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit public watchdog organization.","As the ethanol industry seeks to decarbonize, so as to meet tax credit requirements, pipeline companies are planning to establish routes across the Midwest. Those pipelines will transport and sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during ethanol production, allowing ethanol plants to take advantage of tax credits.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 expanded the 45Q tax credit.

According to documentation from the Iowa Corn Growers Association, this credit incentivizes carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), with the federal government providing funding as follows:

$85 per metric ton (17¢ cents per gallon of ethanol) for CO2 permanently sequestered underground, and

$60 per metric ton (12¢ cents per gallon of ethanol) for CO2 used for enhanced oil recovery or other industrial uses.

The 45Z tax credit specifically incentivizes fuel producers to lower their carbon intensity (CI) scores to 50 or lower. For on-road vehicles, 45Z offers 2¢ per gallon, up to $1 per gallon for every CI point reduction below 50. For sustainable aviation fuel, 45Z offers 3½¢ per gallon, up to $1.75 per gallon for every CI point reduction below 50.

Growing a Pipeline

The first large-scale CO2 pipeline in the U.S. was the Canyon Reef pipeline, established in the 1970s for use during the enhanced oil recovery process in the Permian Basin in Texas. Pipeline infrastructure grew to around 3,000 miles during the early 2000s. Now there are over 5,300 miles of carbon pipelines in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the country will need an increase of up to 20 times the existing carbon pipeline mileage by 2050. Several studies have attempted to optimize the required pipelines. based on varying estimates of CO2 that will need to be transported, with an estimated 30,000 to 96,000 miles of additional carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) pipelines required by 2050, according to the Department of Energy. In addition to the expansion in pipeline capacity, other modes of CO2 transportation will also be required for facilitating offshore storage, shorter routes, and collection from facilities, including barge, ship, train, and truck.

Safety Responsibilities

While carbon pipelines haven’t noted a fatality since reporting began in 1988, like any project of this magnitude, landowners and advocacy groups have voiced concerns about safety.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, a trade association for ethanol producers, said confusion and political agendas have clouded the discussion around carbon pipeline safety.

“We've been operating CO2 pipelines in this country for 40 years, and they've been operating even longer in other countries,” Shaw said. “There's never been a loss of life — you can't say that for almost anything else — so the track record is pretty good. I have to differentiate between the people who have safety questions, and the people who use questions as a political instrument to oppose CO2 pipelines because they don't like them.”

Congress has the ultimate responsibility to set pipeline safety regulations. The federal Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is ultimately responsible for issuing and enforcing safety regulations. States are allowed to accept the responsibility for regulations within their borders with an annual certification from PHMSA. State and local governments can regulate development near pipelines with their land use authority.

Inspections are performed by the pipeline company and pipeline regulators, according to the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit public watchdog organization. Requirements for pipeline inspections vary on factors such as contents, location, and width. Some techniques include aerial flyovers, truck drive-bys, or on-foot inspections. Internal inspections are performed by a device called a “smart pig,” which travels through the pipeline, using sensors to detect corrosion, dents, scratches, and other weaknesses.

PHMSA requires pipeline companies to produce dispersion models, as well as risk analyses to identify potential impacts to high-consequence areas. Factors include topography, weather, leaked CO2 volume, and pipe diameter — while modeled at maximum, higher-than-normal operating volume. A pipeline operator must have a written integrity management program that addresses the risk on each pipeline segment, identify preventive and mitigative measures to protect each area, and continually evaluate the plan throughout the pipeline’s lifespan.

When a Burst Happens

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless, heavier-than-air gas that can cause asphyxiation after prolonged exposure and is potentially lethal over wide distances. At normal temperatures, CO2 is a gas; CCS pipelines carry CO2 in highly pressurized liquid form. Natural gas pipelines are not suited for CO2 transportation. They have a maximum pressure rating of 1,480 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) — a Class 600 pipeline, according to the American National Standards Institute. A pipeline built for CO2 service is designed for 2,200 psig — a Class 900 pipeline.

When exposed to water, CO2 turns into carbonic acid, which can eat through a steel pipeline, potentially leading to a volatile rupture. When a pressurized pipeline bursts, the dramatic change of pressure at the release point can cause the CO2 to rapidly expand, causing it to drop sharply to sub-freezing temperatures, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

The cold CO2 presents a dermal hazard, causing frostbite like dry ice, to those coming into contact with the released gas or the nearby piping and equipment. It can produce a thick water vapor cloud, which may be dispersed by the wind. Due to the density of CO2, during cool and humid conditions with little to no wind, the CO2 could accumulate in lowlying areas, such as valleys and ditches. This cloud can also reduce visibility — especially at night — making driving or walking through the CO2 release hazardous. As the gas adjusts to ambient air temperatures, the opaque vapor cloud dissipates, but it may still be present.

Recent Pipeline Leaks

In February 2020, a pipeline operated by Denbury Inc. in Satartia, Mississippi, burst, spewing CO2 for about four hours before the rupture was repaired. Over 200 residents in the surrounding area were evacuated, and 45 were hospitalized, according to PHMSA's failure investigation report, which it released May 26, 2022. Many residents experienced seizure-like symptoms, felling those affected and causing tremors and difficulty breathing. Motor vehicles stopped working, impeding emergency response. In the subsequent years, some residents have reported ongoing respiratory issues, as well as headaches, difficulty concentrating, and muscle tremors, according to a report by NPR.

In response, PHMSA in 2022 announced steps to implement new safety measures in its oversight, created the failure investigation report, and began soliciting research to strengthen CO2 pipeline safety.

In its investigation, PHMSA attributed the pipeline burst to soil saturation from recent rainfall. Vertical erosion of the sloped hillside, exacerbated by the rainfall, produced enough load to compress the pipeline and cause the welding to fail. PHMSA found that Denbury’s operations and maintenance procedures didn’t address the potential for pipeline damage caused by soil instability, and that the company's aerial inspection patrols failed to identify the potential geohazard before the incident.

According to the PHMSA's report, Denbury failed to notify local responders, hindering the ability of emergency services to respond in a timely manner; local responders contacted Denbury about 40 minutes after the burst. The report also found that Denbury’s CO2 dispersion model underestimated the potential affected area that could be impacted by a release, and that the modeling did not identify Satartia.

In 2022, PHMSA issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty, and Proposed Compliance Order to Denbury Gulf Coast Pipeline, LLC for multiple violations of Federal pipeline safety regulations, with proposed civil penalties amounting to $3,866,734. In 2025, another $2,366,900 of penalties was proposed. The final penalty assessed was $2,868,100.

In April 2024, Denbury, since acquired by ExxonMobil, was responsible for another pipeline burst in Sulphur, Louisiana. A 2-foot-diameter pipeline at a pump station ruptured and released around 107,000 gallons of CO2 over the course of nearly two and a half hours, according to the Ward Six Fire Protection District in Calcasieu Parish. Residents within a quarter mile of the pump were told to shelter in place, close doors and windows, and turn off air-conditioners. No injuries or serious illnesses were reported at the time.

Looking Forward

In the final days of President Biden’s administration, PHMSA proposed new, comprehensive requirements for CO2 and other hazardous liquid pipelines.

“I have learned first-hand from affected communities in [Sartartia,] Mississippi and across America why we need stronger CO2 pipeline safety standards,” said Tristan Brown, PHMSA deputy administrator at the time of the announcement. “These new requirements will be the strongest, most comprehensive standards for carbon dioxide transportation in the world and will set our nation on a safer path as we continue to address climate challenges.”

It was withdrawn days later when President Trump took office, and issued a sweeping order freezing all pending regulations by executive departments and agencies.

PHMSA’s proposal would have strengthened standards for CO2 pipelines — including CO2 transported in a supercritical fluid state — and establish new standards for transporting CO2 in a gaseous state via pipeline.

Pipeline regulations are in further doubt following Trump’s executive order in February that targeted regulations deemed “unconstitutional” or that would “impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits.”

Despite changes to regulations, Shaw, of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said he expects the Trump administration to continue supporting carbon pipeline projects moving forward.

“Trump is the godfather of the carbon pipelines — he's the one that signed 45Q in the law in such a way that it was actually economically viable to do these projects,” Shaw said. “Biden further enhanced 45Q in the [Inflation Reduction Act].”

In March, South Dakota banned the use of eminent domain for CCS projects. This significantly threatens the future of Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed pipeline, which has its storage location in North Dakota. In April, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission denied, for a second time, the permit for Summit’s pipeline route.The company said it is planning to reapply with a reduced scope.

Shaw said the ban on eminent domain is a de facto ban on the pipeline in the state and that it will hurt ethanol producers who can’t take advantage of the 45Q and 45Z tax credits for sequestering carbon.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/MDRM4QImtv9geujSEFIHv3BN-Go=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ConstructiononDakotaAccessPipeline-128983ee0e3b417f8d133d12fbbf395f.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:30:34.840435

CPC explored in recent months bids for assets held by public and private equity-backed gas producers active in shale formations that are well connected to existing or upcoming LNG plants, such as the Haynesville shale field of east Texas and Louisiana, the sources said.

It has also considered bids for assets in mature plays like the Marcellus in the Appalachian Basin, which have attracted more buyer interest in recent years as technological advancements have allowed operators to extract more hydrocarbons at lower drilling costs, the sources added.

CPC did not respond to a request for comment.

The sources cautioned that any deal was not guaranteed, and CPC could still buy assets somewhere else. They requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.

Taiwan’s LNG imports have been rising steadily over the last 15 years, according to data from ship tracker Kpler, hitting a record 21.78 million metric tons in 2024.

SECURING ENERGY SECURITY

Some Asian companies, including CPC, have already bought stakes in various U.S. LNG plants. Ownership in gas producing assets can be a way for them to secure supply of the fuel to these plants.

In March, the Taiwanese company signed an agreement with Alaska Gasline Development Corp to buy LNG and invest in the Alaska LNG project which will transport gas south from Alaska’s remote north via pipeline, to be shipped as LNG to Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te said this would ensure the island’s energy security.

Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance.
""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive.","Nearly every county in the United States has experienced flooding in the past few decades, but just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

It's what experts call the flood insurance gap. Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flooding. And while FEMA aid may be available to help people repair their homes after federally declared disasters, it often covers just a fraction of the costs.

That means when floodwaters come, people frequently are on their own to pick up the pieces. It's a reality communities across the country are facing after flooding hit parts of Texas, New Mexico and North Carolina in the past week alone. In all three states, the floods were caused by extremely heavy rainfall inland — a risk that's growing with climate change. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. As temperatures rise, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time.

One solution: Homeowners, renters and businesses can buy flood insurance, which most people get through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change.

Federal flood insurance offers up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for nonresidential buildings. People can buy policies that also cover the belongings inside their home, including clothing and furniture. The program is open to anyone who lives in one of the approximately 22,600 communities that have adopted certain standards to regulate development in their floodplains. Porter estimates that people living in more than 90% of U.S. counties are eligible. For people who want flood insurance but live outside of a qualifying community, they would have to go to the private market.

""It's clear that [flood] insurance protects property owners and it protects the communities,"" Porter says. ""It ends up keeping property values from dropping, post-event. It ultimately ends up keeping properties from going into foreclosure.""

In some places, though, federal flood insurance is unaffordable for many residents, and costs are rising around the country.

So, people ""roll the dice, hope [a flood] doesn't happen,"" says Brian O'Connell, an analyst at insuranceQuotes, an online platform where people can compare and buy insurance. ""And when it does happen — and we talk to people who it happens to — it's one of the worst things people ever experience in their lives.""

Some see ""life changing"" flood insurance costs

The U.S. government created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 when private companies stopped offering coverage. The federal program, which is backed by taxpayers, has been chronically in debt, borrowing from the Treasury to pay claims.

Several years ago, FEMA began overhauling how the flood program sets its prices. Now, premiums are based on a home's value, FEMA says, and the flood risk an individual property faces. That's a more granular approach than the government used before. FEMA says one of the goals is to encourage actions that reduce flood risks.

As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S. In Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, for example, where 9 out of 10 homes are at risk of flooding, people are looking at paying more than $5,400 a year for flood insurance, an average increase of more than 500%. That's on top of their regular home insurance costs.

""The guy with a million dollar house, he'll figure it out,"" says Anderson Baker, a retired insurance executive in Louisiana. ""The guy with a $150,000 house, a couple hundred dollars extra a month, or $300 extra a month, that's a life-changing increase in his premium.""

O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance. There are companies that have started to offer flood insurance again, which creates some competition for the federal program, says Porter of First Street. However, private insurers only cover 12% of the market, according to First Street.

For some people, taking on the added expense of flood insurance isn't much of a choice. Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance. Properties that have received federal disaster aid in the past also must be covered by flood insurance to qualify for future assistance. And in Florida, the state-backed insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., has started requiring homeowners that have coverage for wind damage to also buy flood insurance.

If a lot more people bought flood insurance, it would drive down the cost of coverage and could entice more private insurers into the market, says Michelle Osborne, director of the Risk Management Institute at Campbell University.

But as things stand, the cost of flood insurance is often a dealbreaker for people, says O'Connell of insuranceQuotes, especially since many doubt they need protection.

""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive. ""But everybody's in a flood zone. People at the top of a mountain are in a flood zone.

After a record 10.3 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale capacity was added in 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) now projects that an even greater 18.2 GW will come online in 2025. This momentum is more than just a number—it reflects the growing recognition that energy storage is essential to building a modern, flexible grid.

To keep this growth on track, the sector must adapt to a changing landscape. Rising interest rates are reshaping capital markets, and increased exposure to merchant revenues is testing traditional financing models. At the same time, ongoing interconnection delays and shifting market rules add further complexity.

But these aren’t signs of weakness—they’re catalysts for innovation. Developers, investors, and policymakers now have a unique opportunity to redefine how storage projects are financed, deployed, and monetized. From revenue stacking strategies to novel risk-sharing structures, the storage industry is evolving rapidly, and smart collaboration will be key to unlocking its full potential.

The path forward will require creativity, coordination, and continued investment—but the rewards are clear: a more resilient, reliable, and decarbonized grid.

Unlocking Investment in Battery Energy Storage Through Innovation

Battery energy storage projects face distinct technical challenges that complicate their development and financing. A key concern is the degradation of battery systems over time. Lithium-ion batteries, the predominant technology in energy storage, experience capacity fade and increased internal resistance due to inherent electrochemical processes. This degradation not only reduces the efficiency and lifespan of the storage systems but also necessitates additional capital for maintenance or augmentation strategies to sustain performance levels.

Moreover, merchant revenue streams for battery storage are inherently unpredictable. Unlike solar and wind projects that often benefit from long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) providing income stability, battery storage revenues are typically derived from multiple market-based sources, such as energy arbitrage, ancillary services, and capacity markets. These markets can be volatile and are subject to regulatory changes, making it challenging to forecast long-term profitability. However, revenue stacking across these diverse sources—when optimized—can improve overall return potential and attract more sophisticated investment structures.

Another hurdle is securing traditional debt financing. Battery storage technology’s relatively nascent status means there is limited historical performance data, leading to increased perceived risk among lenders. Consequently, projects often face higher equity requirements and less favorable loan terms compared to more mature renewable energy ventures. In ERCOT, for example, debt sizing for standalone storage is often limited to 20-30% of total project cost, reflecting lender uncertainty around merchant market returns. To address this, developers and financiers are working to improve bankability through standardized performance contracts, third-party warranties, and novel structures that mitigate merchant risk.

Capital Constraints are Driving Short-Term Strategies

In response to the current financial landscape, many developers are adopting a “develop and flip” approach. This strategy involves focusing on the initial stages of project development, such as permitting and construction, and then selling the project upon completion. This model allows developers to recycle capital more swiftly and mitigate long-term market risks associated with operational uncertainties.

However, this approach underscores a broader issue: The current financial environment is not conducive to long-term ownership models for energy storage assets, at least as it stands today. The complexities of forecasting revenue streams, coupled with supply chain uncertainties, make long-term investments more challenging. Consequently, developers are often compelled to either delay or even exit projects early, potentially missing out on long-term value creation. Finding ways to de-risk the operational phase—through incentives, creditworthy offtake arrangements, or hedging mechanisms—can help more projects remain viable through their full lifecycle.

Investors are also recalibrating their expectations in light of the sector’s unique challenges. There’s a growing demand for higher equity contributions and enhanced risk protections before committing to projects. This cautious stance reflects the broader uncertainties permeating the sector, including technological risks, regulatory changes, and market volatility.

Yet, the IRA introduced significant incentives for clean energy projects, notably the provision for tax credit transferability. This mechanism allowed developers to monetize credits earlier, unlocking liquidity and reducing project risk exposure. That said, recent legislative developments have introduced uncertainty. The House recently passed a bill proposing to phase out or repeal many of these energy credits, including the transferability provisions, over the next two years. While the bill will continue to see changes as it moves through the Senate, its advancement signals that bipartisan consensus on clean energy policy is weakening, raising serious questions about the long-term availability of tax incentives that developers rely on. This policy volatility only reinforces the need for flexible financial strategies that can withstand shifting legislative priorities.

Building Financial Models for a Volatile Market

The current financial climate necessitates a fundamental reevaluation of how energy storage projects are financed and managed. It’s important for developers to take a more dynamic approach to diversify their capital stacks by integrating a mix of equity, merchant-tolerant debt, and alternative financing mechanisms like synthetic hedging tools to enhance financial resilience and mimic the certainty of PPAs. Moreover, exit strategies should be more flexible, accounting for potential shifts in market conditions and policy landscapes. New models that align with project risk profiles—such as tiered revenue-sharing, infrastructure funds, or offtake-backed securitization—can bring more institutional capital into the space.

By adopting a more adaptable financial model, developers can better navigate uncertainties and position their projects for long-term success. Many electricity markets still undervalue what battery storage provides to the grid. Current pricing structures emphasize instantaneous power, not duration or flexibility, limiting compensation for multi-hour systems that could help manage peak demand and avoid costly transmission investments. While progress is emerging, such as ISO New England’s new day-ahead ancillary service market, more reform is needed to unlock long-term bankability. Policymakers and market operators must accelerate reforms that reward flexibility, fast response, and multi-hour capacity—core attributes of modern storage systems.

To foster a more stable and conducive environment for energy storage financing, concerted efforts are required. Policymakers should prioritize streamlining permitting processes, clarifying tax credit transfer procedures, and implementing market reforms that accurately value the full spectrum of services provided by battery energy storage. Financial institutions, in turn, need to develop innovative financing structures that align with the unique risk profiles of storage projects. Ultimately, advancing both the policy and financial ecosystem will be essential to ensuring battery storage fulfills its promise as a cornerstone of a reliable, low-carbon grid.

Now, a newly passed federal spending bill has pulled the plug. President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” ends EV and plug-in hybrid tax credits on September 30, 2025. That leaves consumers a tight summer window to cash in on savings​ up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used models​ before Washington slams the vault shut.

And make no mistake: this is no temporary pause. It’s one of the most aggressive federal walk-backs on electrification policy to date. If you’re shopping for an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, the clock’s ticking​ and so is your potential to save thousands.

How does it compare to rivals?

The biggest rival right now isn’t another car​ it’s time. Only around 20 models qualify for full federal incentives, due to complicated rules around domestic manufacturing, battery sourcing, and price caps under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, and Tesla Model 3, Y, and Cybertruck still make the cut. Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 sneak in via leasing, thanks to a quirk in the legislation that awards credits to the leasing company rather than the buyer.

This leasing loophole has become the industry’s clever workaround. Many models that don’t qualify for tax credits under direct purchase​ such as foreign-built EVs​ can still benefit from credits if leased. The catch? It’s up to the leasing company to pass those savings along, and not all do. So shoppers should ask pointedly before signing anything with an “APR” on it.

Who is this for​ and who should skip it?

If you’ve been on the EV fence, this summer may be your best shot to leap off it. New electric vehicles remain expensive​ the average EV sells for about $63,000, a solid $13,000 more than a comparable gas-powered model. Tax credits helped narrow that gap for many buyers. Come October, they’ll be gone, leaving price-conscious shoppers to either pay full freight or wait for automakers to lower MSRPs voluntarily.

Shoppers looking at “affordable” EVs should be especially aware. The Chevy Equinox EV, touted as a sub-$30K electric crossover after incentives, could see its effective price jump by several thousand dollars this fall. And Slate Auto​ , a startup promising a $19,900 EV​ , recently updated its pricing to “mid-twenties.” Surprise, surprise. The base model budget EV is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

On the flip side, buyers who prioritize performance, luxury, or tech over price may shrug. For them, EV adoption isn’t just about cost​ it’s about experience. But don’t expect those tax credits to return soon. The political winds have shifted, and Washington’s wallet is staying closed.

Carvalho emphasised the need for the UK to handle recycling of battery material itself.","As EV battery market developments continue, focus is shifting to the beginning and end processes of the journey, and especially skills. Autovista24 special content editor, Phil Curry, reports from the recent Battery Cells and Systems Expo.

Batteries are perhaps the most important component in an EV. The ability to store and release energy in an efficient manner is critical for driving range and vehicle performance.

As the technology advances, the market expands. Seasoned suppliers and new startups battle for a share, aiming to launch the best products, services, and and supply chains.

This was evident at the recent Battery Cells and Systems Expo, a two-day conference and exhibition held in Birmingham, UK. The event brought together manufacturers, suppliers, academics and users to discuss the growing battery market.

Building on battery skills

While the UK looks to build its battery supply chain, from materials processing to assembly in gigafactories, it needs a workforce dedicated to this task.

Tom Spencer, director at beet Industrial Communications, commented that skills are becoming more important than ever in the battery industry. Around 75% of the supply chain is based in China. This has caused other markets to look at the technology as a sovereign infrastructure capability.

‘The question for the UK market, with gigafactories being built, is where to find staff,’ Spencer told the audience.

Tony Harper, director at Tony Harper Consultancy Services, added that when initial funding was released to the automotive sector in 2017 to develop a battery industry in the UK, little was spent on skills.

‘As we approached the second phase of the build-up plans, it became increasingly clear that it was not tenable for us to support the growth of the industry and not support skills,’ he commented. ‘So we went to those building the gigafactories, and asked them what they needed.

‘They highlighted the fact that thousands and thousands of people would need to be found and trained in a variety of positions to support battery development, manufacturing, and supply.’

Different approaches

Steve Doyle, CEO at EVERA Recruitment, broke down the number of people needed in different areas. He highlighted that the Faraday battery challenge, part of the UK research and innovation challenge fund, identified that 270,000 people will be employed by the EV and battery market by 2040. Of these, 90,000 will be in newly created jobs, and 30,000 of these will be in the gigafactory and supply chain markets.

However, he added that the issues stem from finding the right people to place in these jobs. ‘If you want to recruit for a gigafactory, you cannot recruit from the gigafactory next door, because it does not exist yet,’ he told the audience.

‘You first have to break the manufacturing processes down. You have powder handling, slurries, deposition, coating, calendaring, slitting, electrolyte filling, welding, and so on. And people doing these jobs exist today. While academic institutes are doing a great job of training the next generation, we can recruit for today,’ he went on to say.

Doyle offered additional examples of how existing roles are similar to the workflows needed in EV battery production, such as looking at the coating and deposition sector.

‘We even found that electrolyte filling processes could be linked to a company that was putting soy sauce into sachets,’ he added.

Looking to China

There is also the potential to recruit from China, which has a large number of gigafactories.

‘There are executives in China who understand the market, understand the talent, and speak good English. It is the same with scientists in the country. So let us get some of that knowledge by partnering with China and learn from them,’ Doyle added.

Chinese gigafactories are also run more efficiently, giving the UK a potential insight into how it can develop a more streamlined and skilled workforce. This would fill the skills gap more quickly, whilst reducing costs.

‘Currently, a gigafactory in the western world operates with 100 heads per gigawatt hour. So a 40gWh factory will need 4,000 people. Of those, half will be operatives, 20% will be support staff, and 30% will be the engineers and the scientists,’ he continued.

‘In China, the very efficient gigafactories are now running at 25 heads per gigawatt hour. They also work a 72-hour week, something that is standard in the country. They have a quarter of the staff working twice as many hours. We will never be able to compete with that.

‘So, while we train up a UK workforce, let us assimilate those skills from China into the UK. This is about building a workforce today, bringing in talent, learning from that, and creating around it,’ stated Doyle.

Recycling efforts

While battery development remains in constant flux, attention is increasingly turning to end-of-life challenges as well.

EV batteries will not last forever. Once their state of charge deteriorates below usefulness, they will need to be replaced. As a battery contains potentially toxic materials, it needs to be disposed of carefully.

However, recycling key components not only reduces the environmental impact but could also improve sustainability and reduce raw material requirements.

‘The majority of EVs in the UK today are larger vehicles, such as SUVs. For this reason, the batteries they use will be bigger, and this gives more scope for materials recycling,’ Dr Diogo Vieira Carvahlo, innovation lead for batteries at the Battery Innovation programme, told the audience.

‘However, the overall UK trend is for smaller cars, so whether EVs will follow this path, requiring smaller batteries, remains to be seen.’

‘The main cathode active material for recycling comes from manufacturing scrap at the moment. This trend is likely to continue into 2030. By this point, the UK needs to be able to handle 17kt of battery packs for recycling,’ he outlined.

Carvalho emphasised the need for the UK to handle recycling of battery material itself. This, he added is essential if the country is to play an important part within the global battery market.

‘If the UK wants to have a strong supply of catalytic material in the UK, and become self-sufficient for that, then it will need to ensure that disposed batteries remain in the country, so it can transform some of that ‘black mass’ to this material type. But to ensure it can do this, timing is important,’ Carvahlo stated.

Opportunities ahead

Despite looking at certain materials that would be in high demand, Carvahlo highlighted that the recycling industry needs to cover the entire materials chain.

‘The UK also needs to be able to handle low-value material, which will come into the market very quickly. You may be interested in catalytic materials, but all other elements need to be worked in,’ he noted.

‘It is important not just to look at the battery cells as a big opportunity, but the packs, the modules, the casings and all of that other material that you need to build up.’

There is a need for the battery market to concentrate on certain materials, which can feed back into the manufacturing process. Limitations on these components will mean buying in raw materials and becoming reliant on a larger supply chain.

‘We need to have circular solutions for materials such as copper and aluminium, which are critical to the UK. We will have significant stock shortages of these materials for future EV applications and other electrification opportunities,’ explained Alexander Thompson, battery materials manager at EMR Group.

‘We need to recover these materials at a suitable grade to be able to go back into the original application, rather than downcycling.’

Supporting local demand

Thompson went on to discuss the importance of onshoring, which has become a growing influence in the global political landscape in recent years. Europe has seen an increase in this practice, while the US is pushing for more onshoring, with the introduction of tariffs to bring companies back to the country.

‘In the UK, we need to make sure that we have materials to support that demand from existing gigafactories, but also new players wanting to come into that market,’ he said.

‘We also need to make sure we can cover the rest of the supply chain, sourcing materials from Europe. This is even more important with new directives coming in covering mandated recycled content targets.’

There is also a potential issue surrounding traceability, with a need to ensure that materials used are treated in an ethical manner. ‘We need to make sure that recycled materials are not going to parts of the world where material security will be jeopardised,’ commented Thompson.

‘Also, from an OEM liability perspective, it is important that when batteries do reach the end of their usable life, they are recycled responsibly. All safety aspects must be taken into consideration.’

Materials forecast

The average lifespan of an EV can give an idea of the processes that need to be put in place to build up a resilient supply chain for materials.

‘The average electric vehicle will last for around 10 to 15 years. So we can see today what the battery feedstock will be like in 10 years, and this gives us high certainty on the materials available going forward. It also means we can see what we will need more of in the future,’ Thompson added.

‘But looking at the data today, even if we recycle 100% of that at 100% efficiency, we still do not meet the demand that will be coming. We would not be able to do a fully circular solution until 2040. So we need to work together to bridge that gap and understand how we can utilise recycled content and virgin content together,’ he concluded.",https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/ev-battery-skills-expo-14-7-25-e1752501771654.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:27:36.219496

The new actions came after President Donald Trump directed the White House Council on Environmental Quality in January to provide guidance to agencies on simplifying and expediting the NEPA permitting process.
“For years NRECA has advocated for more efficient and predictable NEPA reviews and permitting processes that are essential for modernizing our nation’s infrastructure,” NRECA Regulatory Affairs Director Viktoria Seale said.
Many of their recommended reforms were included in the new agency procedures, including the time limits for NEPA reviews.","After years of advocacy by NRECA and electric co-ops, federal agencies are releasing new National Environmental Policy Act procedures that will simplify permitting of cooperatives’ energy and broadband projects.

The Trump administration’s new procedures, which reflect recent NEPA reforms from Congress and court rulings on the law, will benefit a wide range of co-op projects. Reviews under NEPA frequently take years to complete and are required when a project needs a government permit or receives federal grants or loans.

“The announcements deliver what we’ve been requesting for years—simplified, streamlined agency procedures that will allow us to more quickly get projects reviewed and approved,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “This change will benefit all 900 electric cooperatives and will help streamline many co-op projects from Rural Utilities Service loan applications, building new generation, expanding new distribution infrastructure and more.”

On July 1, updated NEPA procedures were released by the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, the Interior, Energy, Transportation and Defense, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The reforms will help expedite infrastructure development and cut project costs by:

Setting deadlines and page limits on NEPA environmental reviews, as required by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (two years and 150 pages for environmental impact statements; one year and 75 pages for environmental assessments).

Clarifying that NEPA does not apply to every federal action.

Allowing agencies to more easily create and adopt “categorical exclusions” for activities that do not have significant environmental impacts.

The NEPA changes will take some time to play out as agencies work to implement them over the coming weeks and months.

The new actions came after President Donald Trump directed the White House Council on Environmental Quality in January to provide guidance to agencies on simplifying and expediting the NEPA permitting process.

The new procedures also follow a recent Supreme Court decision clarifying that agencies generally must only consider the environmental effects of the project they are reviewing rather than study indirect impacts beyond their authority.

NRECA had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case urging better guardrails around the law’s application.

“For years NRECA has advocated for more efficient and predictable NEPA reviews and permitting processes that are essential for modernizing our nation’s infrastructure,” NRECA Regulatory Affairs Director Viktoria Seale said. “This overhaul implements bipartisan amendments to NEPA in 2023 that will focus the scope of environmental reviews and expedite them.”

Co-ops have testified before Congress on the need for permitting reforms to help them meet growing demand for reliable, affordable power and high-speed internet service. Many of their recommended reforms were included in the new agency procedures, including the time limits for NEPA reviews.

But more changes are needed to speed infrastructure development, including policies to limit litigation that could delay crucial projects, Seale said.

“NRECA will continue to advocate for common-sense reforms such as reasonable time limits for filing lawsuits and requiring parties wishing to challenge a NEPA review to have raised their concerns during the public comment period,” she said.

Clean energy days More than 9 out of 10 days so far this year have been powered by 100% clean energy for at least some part of the day in California.
That already surpasses the amount of “clean energy days” last year – and represents a 750% increase in clean energy days since 2022.","SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom today announced California achieved an historic milestone – the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available. California is the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy.

The state released new data showing California’s continued progress toward a clean energy future with 67% of the state’s retail electricity sales in 2023 coming from renewable and zero-carbon electricity generation — compared to just 61% the previous year and around 41% a decade ago. Sources of clean energy include generation from solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal and biomass.

In 2024, the state added a record-breaking 7,000 megawatts (MW) of clean capacity to the grid, representing the largest single-year increase in clean energy capacity added to the grid in state history. This new figure broke the previous records set in both 2022 and 2023, marking a third consecutive year of unprecedented clean energy growth.

Historic investments over the past 15 years have led to an extraordinary pace of development in new clean energy generation. And as the grid is increasingly powered by clean energy, pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period. The power sector is a major driver of the decline in greenhouse gases – emissions from electric power have been cut in half since 2009, helping the state achieve its emissions reductions goals years ahead of schedule.

California is home to the most clean energy jobs in the U.S. and the state’s renewable energy and clean vehicle industries lead the nation in growth. California boasts more than a half-million green jobs and has 7 times more clean jobs than fossil fuel jobs. Solar and wind jobs account for a majority of green jobs, and battery storage and grid modernization is the second-fastest growing sector within California’s clean energy workforce.

California continues to move at a rapid pace on bringing clean energy online. Since 2019, a record 25,000 MW of new energy resources statewide have been added to the grid, with most of that being solar and battery storage. This aligns with the Governor’s roadmap to the state’s clean energy future released in 2023, which called for 148,000 megawatts (MW) of new clean power by 2045.

“California has achieved yet another major milestone on our journey to a clean energy future. The latest numbers show how our state is demonstrating that clean energy is mainstream and is here to stay,” said California Energy Commission (CEC) Chair David Hochschild.

Sources eligible under the state’ Renewables Portfolio Standard – such as solar and wind – made up 43% of the power mix in 2023, up from 39% in 2022. Other zero carbon resources continue to power the grid with large hydro accounting for 12% and nuclear power at 12% in 2023.

“California has set ambitious clean energy goals, and utilities and community choice aggregators have stepped up to deliver clean resources at competitive prices to communities up and down the state,” said California Public Utilities Commission President Alice Reynolds. “We are bringing renewable energy online at an unprecedented scale and pace never seen before.”

Solar represents the technology with the largest amount of installed renewable energy capacity in the state – over 21,000 MW of solar capacity operates the electric grid and another 19,000 MW of behind-the-meter generation. The California grid regularly breaks solar generation peak record levels – the latest solar peak recorded in late May was over 21,500 MW of solar generation.

The state is also doubling down on its goals by swiftly increasing its battery energy storage capacity. The state’s battery fleet now stands at over 15,000 MW – 1,944% higher than when the Governor took office in 2019. The state’s storage fleet is regularly storing any available extra solar energy generated during the day, and supporting the grid by dispatching during the evening.

Clean energy days

More than 9 out of 10 days so far this year have been powered by 100% clean energy for at least some part of the day in California. In 2025, California’s grid has run on 100% clean electricity for an average of 7 hours a day.

Data compiled by the California Energy Commission shows clean energy has powered the equivalent of 51.9 days in the state – nearly 30% of the year to date running on 100% clean electricity. That already surpasses the amount of “clean energy days” last year – and represents a 750% increase in clean energy days since 2022.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/In-historic-first-California-powered-by-two-thirds-clean-energy-–-becoming-largest-economy-in-the-world-to-achieve-milestone-SEO-GFX.png,N,,2025-07-14 14:28:33.451645

Greg Abbott signed legislation requiring data centers and other large, non-critical power consumers in ERCOT to accept curtailment during firm load shed events.
“When I saw some of the load patterns for AI data centers, it reminded me of a steel mill,” Penny said.
Other risks in ERCOT include the rapid growth of inverter-based resources and their potential to trip offline during grid disturbances.
These efforts will be vital to support reliability in 2025 and beyond,” Texas RE said.","The “disorganized integration” of large loads, like data centers, is the biggest growing reliability risk facing the Lone Star State’s electric grid, according to a June report discussed Thursday at the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

The grid operator for most of the state, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, says 70.5 GW of new load could be interconnected to the system by 2028.

“While the full amount of forecasted load may not materialize, the sheer amount of new demand represents a significant challenge that will require a comprehensive and proactive response,” Texas Reliability Entity, or Texas RE, said in its assessment of the state’s bulk power system.

“We had identified the large loads issue as a risk last year, and since that time, there's been an explosion of activity,” David Penny, director of reliability services for Texas RE, said at the commission’s monthly open meeting.

In June, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation requiring data centers and other large, non-critical power consumers in ERCOT to accept curtailment during firm load shed events. The PUCT is planning to host a workshop on June 21 to take input on implementation of the law.

“Because of the characteristics of large loads, there is an opportunity to look at how they could assist the system, particularly in times of emergency,” Commissioner Kathleen Jackson said. “The characteristics of these large loads, how they behave and how they can respond might be unique in a way that they can help.”

The load profiles of data centers serving artificial intelligence customers do not have the typical, flat load that traditional data centers have, said Penny.

“When I saw some of the load patterns for AI data centers, it reminded me of a steel mill,” Penny said. “Very fast, very large ramps ... which create issues for operators on the grid. They've got to be able to manage those sharp load swings. Voltage control and other things will come into play with how we do that.”

Reserve margin issues associated with large load growth “represent an actionable performance trend, and the disorganized integration of large loads constitutes the largest increased risk” to the ERCOT grid, the Texas RE report found.

Other risks in ERCOT include the rapid growth of inverter-based resources and their potential to trip offline during grid disturbances. Those include solar, wind and batteries.

Total energy from solar generation has increased almost 1,000% over the last five years, while energy from coal resources has declined 25%, according to the report. Wind and solar served 34.8% of total energy in the ERCOT region in 2024 and experienced a peak hourly penetration of nearly 75% percent in March.

At the end of 2024, ERCOT was projecting solar generation capacity to nearly double over the next two years, and storage capacity was forecast to almost triple over the same period.

“As we continue to integrate batteries in the system, we're seeing some very dramatic improvements in our primary frequency response metrics,” Penny said.

The increasing dependence on variable, inverter-based resources “has brought an array of efforts at the state and federal levels to ensure IBRs provide reliable and predictable performance. These efforts will be vital to support reliability in 2025 and beyond,” Texas RE said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/uPeEz4-PoNjcgC3lHtBA2w96TC2oRs349ivvYrizM5k/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMDA3MDk2MjE4X2dRd1hTYVguanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-14 14:31:15.885062

As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S.
O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance.
Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance.
""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive.","Nearly every county in the United States has experienced flooding in the past few decades, but just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

It's what experts call the flood insurance gap. Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flooding. And while FEMA aid may be available to help people repair their homes after federally declared disasters, it often covers just a fraction of the costs.

That means when floodwaters come, people frequently are on their own to pick up the pieces. It's a reality communities across the country are facing after flooding hit parts of Texas, New Mexico and North Carolina in the past week alone. In all three states, the floods were caused by extremely heavy rainfall inland — a risk that's growing with climate change. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. As temperatures rise, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time.

One solution: Homeowners, renters and businesses can buy flood insurance, which most people get through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change.

Federal flood insurance offers up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for nonresidential buildings. People can buy policies that also cover the belongings inside their home, including clothing and furniture. The program is open to anyone who lives in one of the approximately 22,600 communities that have adopted certain standards to regulate development in their floodplains. Porter estimates that people living in more than 90% of U.S. counties are eligible. For people who want flood insurance but live outside of a qualifying community, they would have to go to the private market.

""It's clear that [flood] insurance protects property owners and it protects the communities,"" Porter says. ""It ends up keeping property values from dropping, post-event. It ultimately ends up keeping properties from going into foreclosure.""

In some places, though, federal flood insurance is unaffordable for many residents, and costs are rising around the country.

So, people ""roll the dice, hope [a flood] doesn't happen,"" says Brian O'Connell, an analyst at insuranceQuotes, an online platform where people can compare and buy insurance. ""And when it does happen — and we talk to people who it happens to — it's one of the worst things people ever experience in their lives.""

Some see ""life changing"" flood insurance costs

The U.S. government created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 when private companies stopped offering coverage. The federal program, which is backed by taxpayers, has been chronically in debt, borrowing from the Treasury to pay claims.

Several years ago, FEMA began overhauling how the flood program sets its prices. Now, premiums are based on a home's value, FEMA says, and the flood risk an individual property faces. That's a more granular approach than the government used before. FEMA says one of the goals is to encourage actions that reduce flood risks.

As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S. In Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, for example, where 9 out of 10 homes are at risk of flooding, people are looking at paying more than $5,400 a year for flood insurance, an average increase of more than 500%. That's on top of their regular home insurance costs.

""The guy with a million dollar house, he'll figure it out,"" says Anderson Baker, a retired insurance executive in Louisiana. ""The guy with a $150,000 house, a couple hundred dollars extra a month, or $300 extra a month, that's a life-changing increase in his premium.""

O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance. There are companies that have started to offer flood insurance again, which creates some competition for the federal program, says Porter of First Street. However, private insurers only cover 12% of the market, according to First Street.

For some people, taking on the added expense of flood insurance isn't much of a choice. Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance. Properties that have received federal disaster aid in the past also must be covered by flood insurance to qualify for future assistance. And in Florida, the state-backed insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., has started requiring homeowners that have coverage for wind damage to also buy flood insurance.

If a lot more people bought flood insurance, it would drive down the cost of coverage and could entice more private insurers into the market, says Michelle Osborne, director of the Risk Management Institute at Campbell University.

But as things stand, the cost of flood insurance is often a dealbreaker for people, says O'Connell of insuranceQuotes, especially since many doubt they need protection.

Now, a newly passed federal spending bill has pulled the plug. President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” ends EV and plug-in hybrid tax credits on September 30, 2025. That leaves consumers a tight summer window to cash in on savings​ up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used models​ before Washington slams the vault shut.

And make no mistake: this is no temporary pause. It’s one of the most aggressive federal walk-backs on electrification policy to date. If you’re shopping for an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, the clock’s ticking​ and so is your potential to save thousands.

How does it compare to rivals?

The biggest rival right now isn’t another car​ it’s time. Only around 20 models qualify for full federal incentives, due to complicated rules around domestic manufacturing, battery sourcing, and price caps under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, and Tesla Model 3, Y, and Cybertruck still make the cut. Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 sneak in via leasing, thanks to a quirk in the legislation that awards credits to the leasing company rather than the buyer.

This leasing loophole has become the industry’s clever workaround. Many models that don’t qualify for tax credits under direct purchase​ such as foreign-built EVs​ can still benefit from credits if leased. The catch? It’s up to the leasing company to pass those savings along, and not all do. So shoppers should ask pointedly before signing anything with an “APR” on it.

Who is this for​ and who should skip it?

If you’ve been on the EV fence, this summer may be your best shot to leap off it. New electric vehicles remain expensive​ the average EV sells for about $63,000, a solid $13,000 more than a comparable gas-powered model. Tax credits helped narrow that gap for many buyers. Come October, they’ll be gone, leaving price-conscious shoppers to either pay full freight or wait for automakers to lower MSRPs voluntarily.

Shoppers looking at “affordable” EVs should be especially aware. The Chevy Equinox EV, touted as a sub-$30K electric crossover after incentives, could see its effective price jump by several thousand dollars this fall. And Slate Auto​ , a startup promising a $19,900 EV​ , recently updated its pricing to “mid-twenties.” Surprise, surprise. The base model budget EV is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

On the flip side, buyers who prioritize performance, luxury, or tech over price may shrug. For them, EV adoption isn’t just about cost​ it’s about experience. But don’t expect those tax credits to return soon. The political winds have shifted, and Washington’s wallet is staying closed.

According to new analysis from the Institute for Energy Research (IER), developers shelved or canceled more than 9 gigawatts (GW) of projects over the last two months—a torrid pace that is unprecedented outside of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report, based on data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), revealed that battery storage has been hit the hardest. 4 GW of battery projects were canceled, along with 3.5 GW of solar farms and nearly 2 GW of natural gas plants. IER attributed the surge in cancellations to a mix of policy headwinds, trade uncertainty, and shifting investment signals.

Tariffs, New Legislation Cast a Shadow

Chief among the factors is the renewed trade tension with China, as the Trump administration has reinstated and expanded tariffs on imported solar panels and battery components—most of which originate in China. Battery storage projects, which rely almost entirely on Chinese-made cells, have become particularly vulnerable. The report notes that the uncertainty around these tariffs has led many developers to pause or abandon their plans.

As global trade dynamics shift, multinational tariffs are increasingly disrupting the financial landscape of renewable energy projects. From solar panels and wind turbines to battery storage systems, import tariffs are driving up capital expenditures, complicating deal structures, and introducing new risks for both debt and equity participants. Join a Factor This-hosted webinar on July 30, 2025, for a timely and in-depth discussion on how evolving trade policies are affecting project bankability, investment structures, and long-term returns in the renewable energy sector.

Adding to the uncertainty is the status of federal clean energy tax credits established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under President Joe Biden. Most recently, President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a sweeping legislative package signed into law on Independence Day, seeks to reshape U.S. energy and industrial policy and would largely eliminate the IRA’s subsidies for wind and solar.

Clean energy advocates say this could trigger up to $50 billion in lost solar investment in Texas alone, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

“Even smaller developers are starting to cancel projects since they are likely to be the most sensitive to uncertainty,” IER said.

While clean energy developers have faced new obstacles, Texas state lawmakers have moved to boost natural gas generation. Lawmakers recently expanded the Texas Energy Fund by $5 billion to support up to 10 GW of new gas-fired capacity through low-interest loans. Though some “anti-renewable” bills failed to pass the legislature, IER noted the overall policy direction appears to favor dispatchable thermal power to help manage the variability of wind and solar.

The Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, has also turned up the heat on renewables, claiming that their intermittency adds $2 billion annually in costs to the grid. Critics argue this ignores the broader market benefits of clean energy and the falling costs of solar and battery technologies.

Grid Reliability Improves, Despite Setbacks

Ironically, even as projects are being canceled, ERCOT’s grid reliability is improving.

ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas last month said the state added more than 9,600 megawatts (MW) of capacity over the past year, mostly solar (5,400 MW) and battery storage (3,800 MW). Texas lost a net of more than 360 MW of gas-powered capacity in the same span.

Vegas credited better planning and this surge of new capacity for a dramatic drop in the risk of grid emergencies. After a series of summer reliability scares in 2022 and 2023, ERCOT did not issue a general conservation alert in 2024. For 2025, the risk of a peak-hour emergency has fallen from 16% to under 1%, according to ERCOT projections.

“The state of the grid is strong,” Vegas told ERCOT’s board in June. “It is as reliable as it has ever been… I feel confident that we are ready for this upcoming summer season.”

In fact, Texas recently broke new records for both overall electricity demand and battery deployment during a recent heatwave. Last Friday evening, batteries delivered more than 6 GW of power to the grid during peak hours, a testament to how far the state’s storage fleet has come.

Independent power producer Lydian Energy also announced it secured $233 million in financing for three new battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the ERCOT region, signaling that some developers remain bullish on the market despite the policy upheaval.

ERCOT remains one of the most dynamic power markets in the country, and what happens there often sets the tone for national trends. However, IER pointed out that developers tend to keep non-viable projects on the books for years, making the recent wave of outright cancellations — 4.5 GW in April and 4 GW in May — even more significant.

“Texas, the state with the most renewable energy, may be an early indicator of renewable cancellations that could arise in the rest of the country,” IER said.

While some analysts warn this could be the start of a national cooling-off period for clean energy development, others argue that Texas’s market fundamentals remain intact. The state’s electricity demand is projected to grow by 70% by 2031, driven largely by data center development and population growth.

Whether that demand will be met by renewables, natural gas or a blend of both remains an open question.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/India-solar-and-wind.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:32:47.213561

Environmental Protection Agency that fuel producers have standing to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s approval of California’s vehicle emission regulations. Justice Kavanaugh authored the majority opinion. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson filed separate dissents.

As summarized in Dykema’s May edition, the dispute arose from the EPA’s 2022 decision to reinstate California’s waiver under the Clean Air Act, which allows the state to set more stringent vehicle emission standards. California’s regulations require automakers to increase production of low-emission vehicles and reduce gas-powered vehicle output. Several fuel producers sued, alleging that the EPA lacked authority to approve California’s rules and arguing that the resulting decrease in demand for liquid fuels caused them economic harm.

The Court agreed that the fuel producers have standing to sue, holding that even if they are not directly regulated by California’s rules, the “commonsense economic realities” of the regulatory impact establish an injury. The Court found that the only disputed element—redressability—was satisfied because revoking the EPA’s approval would likely lead automakers to produce more gas-powered vehicles, thereby increasing fuel demand. The Court pointed to the producers’ declarations of past harm from similar regulations, as well as California’s own concession that repealing the rules would likely increase the sales of gas-powered cars.

The majority also noted the inconsistency in the EPA’s and California’s argument: they defended the regulations while simultaneously downplaying their real-world impact. The Court emphasized that although plaintiffs must provide some evidence of predictable market reactions, they are not required to foresee the future with “political clairvoyance,” metaphorically referring to the difficulty courts face in predicting the exact economic and political consequences of their decisions, particularly in dynamic and heavily regulated markets. Nor must plaintiffs rely on declarations from other regulated entities with conflicting interests.

Justice Sotomayor dissented on procedural grounds, arguing that the Court should have remanded the case to the D.C. Circuit. She noted that the D.C. Circuit indicated that the subject California’s regulations would not apply beyond model year 2025 vehicles and therefore questioned the continuing harm to fuel producers. Her position is that a remand could have clarified whether the harm extended beyond that date.

Justice Jackson dissented on mootness grounds, asserting that the EPA was likely to rescind California’s waiver soon, eliminating any live controversy. She criticized the Court for what she described as a “herculean effort” to find standing and cautioned that the decision could reinforce perceptions that the Court is “overly sympathetic” to corporate interests.

Standing for Indirectly Affected Plaintiffs:The Court’s reasoning allows parties affected by downstream market impacts—not just direct regulation—to establish standing, potentially broadening who can challenge agency actions.

Thus, they reasoned, SIP denials are regional actions under the text of the statute.
Limits on Nationwide Scope Claims: A conclusory “nationwide scope or effect” label is insufficient.
The EPA must demonstrate that such a determination truly underlies its decision to shift venue to the D.C.","In a 6-2 decision authored by Justice Thomas, the Supreme Court held in consolidated cases Oklahoma v. EPA and PacifiCorp v. EPA that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s disapprovals of 21 individual state implementation plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) are “locally or regionally applicable” actions, and, as such, must be challenged in their respective regional circuit courts—even when the EPA publishes them in a single, consolidated Federal Register notice.

As summarized in our April issue, in 2025, the EPA disapproved the SIPs, finding that they failed to meet the “good neighbor” provision of the CAA, which requires states to prevent their emissions from affecting air quality in downwind states. The EPA grouped these disapprovals in one Federal Register notice. When affected states and industry stakeholders filed suits in various regional circuits, the EPA successfully argued in the Tenth Circuit that the consolidated publication rendered the action “nationally applicable,” requiring exclusive review in the D.C. Circuit under 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1).

That statute distinguishes between:

“Locally or regionally applicable” actions, which must be challenged in the appropriate regional circuit, and

“Nationally applicable” actions—or regional actions based on a “nationwide scope or effect”—which are reviewed in the D.C. Circuit if the EPA makes and publishes that finding.

Applying the Court’s framework from EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining, LLC—decided the same day:

Each Disapproval Is a Separate Action: The Court held that each disapproval of an SIP is its own distinct, regionally applicable action—even when the EPA groups them for publication. The statutory venue analysis depends on the substance of the action, not how the agency chooses to package its decisions.

No Justified Finding of Nationwide Scope: Although the EPA published a finding of nationwide scope or effect, the Court found that the agency’s actions were not actually based on such a rationale. Instead, the approvals relied on individualized, state-specific determinations. Under Calumet, the national scope exception applies only if it is the primary basis for the agency’s decision. Here, the EPA evaluated each plan on its own merits based on “a number of intensely factual determinations” for each state.

The decision reinforces that venue determinations turn on the substantive basis of EPA actions rather than their form, ensuring that challenges to state-specific environmental decisions can be heard at home in the circuits most familiar with regional conditions and concerns.

Justice Gorsuch, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, concurred in the judgment but expressed disagreement with the majority’s reasoning. Specifically, they took issue with the majority’s view that the EPA must establish that some nationwide conclusion qualifies as the “primary driver” of the challenged action, arguing that amounts to an ambiguous, judicially devised test without an objective standard. Instead, they opined, the CAA requires the EPA to approve or disapprove SIPs for individual states and does not call for a nationally applicable action or determination of nationwide scope or effect by the EPA to do so. Thus, they reasoned, SIP denials are regional actions under the text of the statute. Justice Alito took no part in the decision.

Takeaways:

Venue Is Based on Substance, Not Packaging: The EPA cannot sidestep regional judicial review by combining multiple state-level actions into one administrative publication. Courts will look to the nature of the agency’s decisions, not their format.

Primacy of Regional Circuits: States and stakeholders can challenge disapprovals of state implementation plans in their home circuits, ensuring review by courts familiar with local and regional environmental conditions.

Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange were up 10 cents, or 3.0%, to $3.414/MMBtu at 9:09 a.m. EDT, putting the contract on track for its highest close since July 2.

That price increase occurred despite rising output and forecasts for lower demand over the next two weeks than previously expected.

Even though gas futures have dropped about 14% over the past three weeks, speculators last week boosted their net long futures and options positions on the New York Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange to their highest levels since early-April, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report showed.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said a tropical disturbance off the east coast of Florida has about a 30% chance of strengthening into a tropical storm as it moves west into the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida over the next week.

Analysts have noted that tropical storms in the Gulf can knock some production out of service, but noted that only about 2% of all U.S. gas output comes from the federal offshore Gulf of Mexico.

The analysts noted that storms were more likely to be demand-destroying events as they knock out power to homes and businesses, especially if they shut a LNG export plant.

Meteorologists slightly reduced their forecasts for hotter weather for this week but continued to project weather across the Lower 48 U.S. states will remain mostly warmer than normal through at least July 29, especially in late July.

Even though the weather has remained above normal so far this summer, analysts expect energy firms to keep injecting more gas into storage than usual in coming weeks. That's because output hit a record high in June and was on track to top that in July, while gas flows to LNG export plants have so far languished since hitting a record in April.

There is currently about 6% more gas in storage than the five-year (2020-2024) normal, and analysts expect that surplus to grow in coming weeks. Some analysts, however, noted that an expected rise in LNG exports should start to chip away at that surplus later this year.

Natural gas storage helps make that possible.
This storage network includes underground storage, aquifers and salt caverns, liquified natural gas (LNG), and compressed natural gas (CNG) storage.
However, while natural gas production and pipeline capacity have expanded significantly in recent years, storage capacity has remained largely flat.
As one of the cleanest and low-emitting fuel sources, natural gas storage will support broader climate needs.","Rising power demand across the United States is driving strong momentum to create a more reliable and affordable energy future. A new report from the American Gas Association (AGA) reinforces the critical role of natural gas storage in supporting this vision.

AGA’s report comes amidst major regulatory changes to back American energy and the broader energy supply chain. As industry leaders and policymakers continue to make headway towards U.S. energy dominance, the analysis makes a clear case that investment in natural gas storage will be necessary for the United States’ long term energy strategy, safeguarding consumers against volatility and supporting a resilient power grid.

Storage Is a Power Play

U.S. power demand is estimated to grow 25 percent from 2023 to 2030 and 78 percent by 2050, driven largely by artificial intelligence, data centers and a surge in domestic manufacturing. These industries require not just more electricity, but power that is available at demand. Natural gas storage helps make that possible.

Within the U.S. energy system, gas storage provides flexibility to deliver fuel sources around the clock to homes, business and power generators. This storage network includes underground storage, aquifers and salt caverns, liquified natural gas (LNG), and compressed natural gas (CNG) storage. That flexibility provides balance to consumer and businesses needs during peak demand while keeping price volatility at bay.

However, while natural gas production and pipeline capacity have expanded significantly in recent years, storage capacity has remained largely flat. In2024, U.S. natural gas pipelines increased takeaway capacity by 17.8 Bcf/d, while natural gas storage peak capacity rose by 1.7 percent or 70 Bcf and working gas design capacity increased slightly by 0.1 percent or 3 Bcf in the same year. The drastic gap in growth presents a plethora of challenges for the U.S. energy market. Without adequate storage, communities are at a higher risk for supply disruptions and price swings. AGA further explains:

“Rapidly increasing demand pressures necessitate a rapid buildout of natural gas storage at a time when growth in underground storage capacity has slowed to just 0.1 percent per year. Action by policymakers is essential to avoid potential service interruptions during extreme weather, price shocks for consumers and impacts on grid reliability, particularly in integrating variable renewable energy sources.”

Storage Fulfills Climate Needs

Natural gas storage also plays an important supporting role as renewables take on a larger share of the grid. Wind and solar, while growing rapidly, are variable and can’t always deliver power when needed. Storage-backed natural gas can help smooth over those gaps.

During the spring 2024 solar eclipse, Texas’s ERCOT saw a sharp drop in solar output, resulting in the need to ramp up natural gas generation by 6.2 GW to cover nearly 80 percent of the lost solar capacity. This kind of operational flexibility is vital to maintaining reliability during unplanned or predictable dips in renewable generation.

AGA also recognizes that integrating natural gas storage with intermittent renewables can maintain decarbonization efforts. As one of the cleanest and low-emitting fuel sources, natural gas storage will support broader climate needs.

“Natural gas storage can enable low-carbon pathways. By thinking of storage not simply as a buffer for gas supply, but as a multi-purpose flexibility tool that can unlock decarbonization pathways.”

Regional Constraints and Policy Challenges Ahead

Despite its demonstrated value, U.S. gas storage facilities face growth limitations due to market and policy barriers. From aging infrastructure to regulatory complexities and bottlenecks there is continued uncertainty for storage expansion. More importantly, regions with higher demand, such as the East and Midwest, are experiencing storage constraints that are not reflective of the current pace of natural gas production, demand, and related infrastructure.

For example, AGA confirms that between 2013 and 2023 underground storage capacity did not rise more than 0.2 percent across U.S. regions, while pipeline capacity, production and demand largely grew throughout the country. At its current growth rate, there’s a clear signal that additional storage assets are vital to keep pace with market growth.

To address the imbalance of storage capacity and market growth, collaboration between industry and regulators is needed to streamline project development. While the past administration stonewalled industry voices and ignored the value of gas resources, recent developments suggest a significant shift underway.

AGA emphasizes that robust investment in both underground and LNG storage is vital to maintaining system efficiency and meeting rising energy demand. The Department of Energy has already taken initial steps to remove regulatory hurdles for LNG projects, empowering operators to move forward with buildouts and related infrastructure. Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved an additional 65 Bcf of LNG storage capacity at export facilities in the lower 48 states, with approximately 42 Bcf more pending approval.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Picture2.png,N,,2025-07-14 14:31:20.600694

The only physical signs of a prior use are the matching curb cuts alongside George Washington Way. Otherwise you may not know it once had a blighted Economy Inn motel that was as unsightly as it was a drain on the city’s resources.

And part of the reason it’s no longer there is because the city, using funds from a 2021 federal grant, was able to have the property evaluated and assessed for contamination due to its status as a brownfield, paving the way for its demolition two years ago.

Brownfields is a term to describe tracts of land that have been developed, potentially polluted and then abandoned.

“Anytime you can turn a brownfield into a greenfield, it’s worth it,” Mandy Wallner, Richland’s business and economic development manager, told the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business. “It’s better for the environment. It’s better for future development.”

Local government officials hope another $1.2 million federal grant will lead to the revitalization of similar vacant lots and dilapidated buildings in areas across the Mid-Columbia.

The money will be used to conduct environmental site assessments and regulated building materials surveys for properties ranging from former gas stations and dry cleaners to factories and vacant lots. Those assessments and surveys would then be used to develop site cleanup and reuse plans that support property sale or redevelopment activities for eligible sites.

“We want to make sure we’re using these dollars to drive future development,” Michelle Holt, the council’s executive director, told the Journal. “There can be a stigma to the idea of a property being a brownfield.”

The Benton-Franklin Council of Governments, along with a coalition of Mid-Columbia cities, Richland, Prosser and Connell, and nonprofit Habitat for Humanity were one of three entities in Washington state awarded a Brownfields Assessment Coalition Grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Holt noted that while the council and its coalition have been selected for a grant award, it has not been formally provided yet per EPA’s process.

It follows on an initial EPA grant for $600,000 the council and partnering cities received in 2021 that paid for projects such as the initial assessments and evaluation of Richland’s Economy Inn site and a dozen other brownfield properties in the region.

There are more than 250 current or former brownfields in the Tri-Cities alone, with nearly 14,500 across the state.

Brownfields may have environmental contamination ranging from underground fuel tanks of former gas stations to solvents from dry cleaners. But they can also be former orchards or homes built prior to 1970. Or a brownfield may not have any contamination at all, but the assumption they do stifles redevelopment.

“Brownfields are the ultimate fixer-uppers,” the state Department of Ecology wrote in a recent blog post. “If left languishing, they slam the door on hopes for more affordable housing, public services, businesses and public spaces for people to gather.”

And redevelopment can be successful.

Bellingham’s The Millworks, Seattle’sMount Baker Properties affordable housing, Wenatchee’spublic market and Spokane’sRiverfront Park are all on former brownfields.

Among the projects lined up for this next grant are assessments and evaluations of a former agricultural field for potential affordable housing, determinations of next steps for the site of the former Prosser City Hall that burned down several years ago and working with the owners of several properties along Connell’s Columbia Avenue, the small Franklin County city’s primary commercial area.

Holt said more projects could be added, if they are a good fit for the coalition’s goals.

“The nice thing about this grant is that we’re not limited to what we identified,” she said.

Most importantly, officials hope the projects demonstrate to other property owners the potential for redeveloping their own possible brownfields.

According to new analysis from the Institute for Energy Research (IER), developers shelved or canceled more than 9 gigawatts (GW) of projects over the last two months—a torrid pace that is unprecedented outside of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report, based on data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), revealed that battery storage has been hit the hardest. 4 GW of battery projects were canceled, along with 3.5 GW of solar farms and nearly 2 GW of natural gas plants. IER attributed the surge in cancellations to a mix of policy headwinds, trade uncertainty, and shifting investment signals.

Tariffs, New Legislation Cast a Shadow

Chief among the factors is the renewed trade tension with China, as the Trump administration has reinstated and expanded tariffs on imported solar panels and battery components—most of which originate in China. Battery storage projects, which rely almost entirely on Chinese-made cells, have become particularly vulnerable. The report notes that the uncertainty around these tariffs has led many developers to pause or abandon their plans.

As global trade dynamics shift, multinational tariffs are increasingly disrupting the financial landscape of renewable energy projects. From solar panels and wind turbines to battery storage systems, import tariffs are driving up capital expenditures, complicating deal structures, and introducing new risks for both debt and equity participants. Join a Factor This-hosted webinar on July 30, 2025, for a timely and in-depth discussion on how evolving trade policies are affecting project bankability, investment structures, and long-term returns in the renewable energy sector.

Adding to the uncertainty is the status of federal clean energy tax credits established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under President Joe Biden. Most recently, President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a sweeping legislative package signed into law on Independence Day, seeks to reshape U.S. energy and industrial policy and would largely eliminate the IRA’s subsidies for wind and solar.

Clean energy advocates say this could trigger up to $50 billion in lost solar investment in Texas alone, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

“Even smaller developers are starting to cancel projects since they are likely to be the most sensitive to uncertainty,” IER said.

While clean energy developers have faced new obstacles, Texas state lawmakers have moved to boost natural gas generation. Lawmakers recently expanded the Texas Energy Fund by $5 billion to support up to 10 GW of new gas-fired capacity through low-interest loans. Though some “anti-renewable” bills failed to pass the legislature, IER noted the overall policy direction appears to favor dispatchable thermal power to help manage the variability of wind and solar.

The Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, has also turned up the heat on renewables, claiming that their intermittency adds $2 billion annually in costs to the grid. Critics argue this ignores the broader market benefits of clean energy and the falling costs of solar and battery technologies.

Grid Reliability Improves, Despite Setbacks

Ironically, even as projects are being canceled, ERCOT’s grid reliability is improving.

ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas last month said the state added more than 9,600 megawatts (MW) of capacity over the past year, mostly solar (5,400 MW) and battery storage (3,800 MW). Texas lost a net of more than 360 MW of gas-powered capacity in the same span.

Vegas credited better planning and this surge of new capacity for a dramatic drop in the risk of grid emergencies. After a series of summer reliability scares in 2022 and 2023, ERCOT did not issue a general conservation alert in 2024. For 2025, the risk of a peak-hour emergency has fallen from 16% to under 1%, according to ERCOT projections.

“The state of the grid is strong,” Vegas told ERCOT’s board in June. “It is as reliable as it has ever been… I feel confident that we are ready for this upcoming summer season.”

In fact, Texas recently broke new records for both overall electricity demand and battery deployment during a recent heatwave. Last Friday evening, batteries delivered more than 6 GW of power to the grid during peak hours, a testament to how far the state’s storage fleet has come.

Independent power producer Lydian Energy also announced it secured $233 million in financing for three new battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the ERCOT region, signaling that some developers remain bullish on the market despite the policy upheaval.

ERCOT remains one of the most dynamic power markets in the country, and what happens there often sets the tone for national trends. However, IER pointed out that developers tend to keep non-viable projects on the books for years, making the recent wave of outright cancellations — 4.5 GW in April and 4 GW in May — even more significant.

“Texas, the state with the most renewable energy, may be an early indicator of renewable cancellations that could arise in the rest of the country,” IER said.

While some analysts warn this could be the start of a national cooling-off period for clean energy development, others argue that Texas’s market fundamentals remain intact. The state’s electricity demand is projected to grow by 70% by 2031, driven largely by data center development and population growth.

Whether that demand will be met by renewables, natural gas or a blend of both remains an open question.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/HYD/2021/11/Renewables-scaled-1-b.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:32:50.231769

But with Q4 2025 deadlines fast approaching, the company is ill-prepared to meet supply chain and profitability targets.
But as reality catches up, the company's vulnerabilities—exposed by delayed supply chains, regulatory missteps, and eroding margins—are too stark to ignore.","Elon Musk's vision of a sustainable energy future has long been the bedrock of Tesla's valuation. However, as the clock ticks toward the end of 2025, the company faces a perfect storm of regulatory headwinds, supply chain vulnerabilities, and strategic missteps that threaten its profitability—and investors should brace for a reckoning.

The Tax Credit Cliff: A $7,500 Revenue Loss Per Vehicle

Tesla's eligibility for the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit hinges on sourcing 60% of battery minerals and components from North America by 2025. While the Cybertruck and Model Y/X currently qualify, the IRS's Q4 2025 deadline for excluding “foreign entities of concern” (read: China) will disrupt this.

Panasonic's delayed ramp-up of its Kansas factory—a critical supplier for Tesla's 2170 batteries—exacerbates the problem. With Tesla's U.S. demand projected to drop as buyers rush to qualify for the tax credit before its expiration, Panasonic's production timeline is now out of sync with market needs. Meanwhile, Tesla's reliance on Chinese mineral suppliers (e.g., 91% of global anode production is Chinese-controlled) leaves it exposed to supply chain disruptions and regulatory penalties.

Emission Credit Windfall Dries Up

Tesla's non-operating profits have long depended on selling zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credits to competitors. In 2023, these credits contributed $2.3 billion to Tesla's bottom line. But as legacy automakers like GM and Ford scale EV production, demand for ZEV credits is collapsing.

By Q4 2025, ZEV credit sales could drop to near-zero as competitors achieve compliance. This loss of “free cash” will force Tesla to rely solely on razor-thin EV margins—already strained by rising raw material costs and competition.

Musk's Distracted Leadership: Delayed Realization of Risks

While Musk obsesses over Twitter and neuralink ventures, Tesla's strategic execution falters. The delayed Kansas plant ramp-up, for instance, reflects a lack of urgency in securing domestic supply chains. Meanwhile, Musk's public dismissal of battery cost reductions (“We'll solve it with software!”) clashes with hard realities:

Supply Chain Reliance: Tesla's battery supply chain remains 70% dependent on Chinese firms for critical minerals.

Price Caps Undermine Profitability: To qualify for tax credits, Tesla must keep Cybertruck/Y/X models under $80,000—a ceiling that pressures margins as input costs rise.

Competitor Surge: Ford (F), Rivian (RIVN), and GM (GM) are now undercutting Tesla on pricing and federal incentives, eroding its market share.

Cash Flow Collapse Imminent

Tesla's Q4 2025 margins are poised for a freefall:

- Lost Tax Credit Revenue: Up to $7,500 per vehicle in lost demand from U.S. buyers.

- ZEV Credit Revenue Collapse: A $2 billion annual income stream vanishes.

- Supply Chain Costs: Rising mineral prices and delayed domestic production will squeeze gross margins below 15%—a level unsustainable for growth.

Investment Recommendation: Sell Immediately

The math is clear: Tesla's valuation relies on assumptions of perpetual growth and regulatory grace periods. But with Q4 2025 deadlines fast approaching, the company is ill-prepared to meet supply chain and profitability targets.

Risk Factors:

60%+ dependency on Chinese battery supply chains.

ZEV credit revenue down 80% by end-2025.

Stock price volatility as tax credit eligibility questions mount.

Action: Exit Tesla (TSLA) positions now. The stock's valuation already assumes flawless execution—a bar Tesla has repeatedly missed. While historically, TSLA has shown a 75% recovery rate over thirty days following earnings misses, the current convergence of regulatory deadlines, supply chain bottlenecks, and margin pressures suggests this pattern may not hold this time.

Conclusion: A Tesla Without Musk's Charisma

Tesla's appeal has long been tied to Musk's visionary persona. But as reality catches up, the company's vulnerabilities—exposed by delayed supply chains, regulatory missteps, and eroding margins—are too stark to ignore. Investors who cling to Tesla's narrative risk a painful lesson: even disruptors can't outrun the law of supply and demand.

However, analysts who’ve combed through the fine print report that certain tax breaks for US battery plants survived the bloodbath.

At the last minute, our leaders reversed course and decided to preserve the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits for battery manufacturing. As the Battery Council puts it, “the 45X credits have already catalyzed billions in domestic investment and created thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs across the country.”

“This vote sends a powerful message that America is committed to building and maintaining the world’s most advanced battery manufacturing ecosystem,” said Battery Council President Roger Miksad. “These credits don’t just support individual companies—they strengthen our entire domestic supply chain and ensure America remains the global leader [sic] in battery innovation.”

It remains to be seen how many EV-related projects will be cancelled or delayed because of cuts in federal funding and tax breaks, but at least one endangered battery factory has gained a new lease on life.

Early versions of the budget bill eliminated production tax credits for projects that used Chinese technology. This would have affected a $3-billion LFP battery plant that Ford is building in Marshall, Michigan, because the project will use technology licensed from Chinese battery giant CATL.

Chinese companies are years ahead of Western companies in battery technology. The fact that these companies have received billions of dollars’ worth of state support is called “unfair,” and is cited as a reason for the US to try to shut out Chinese products and technology. But as Michael Dunne, an expert on the Chinese auto industry puts it, “Americans can complain about it all they want, but China isn’t going to scrap this model just because we don’t like it.” It is nearly impossible to build batteries without using some Chinese technology, analysts and industry executives told the New York Times.

Apparently, cooler heads on Capitol Hill understand this, and were able to get changes made to the bill in order to allow some US battery projects, including Ford’s LFP plant, to proceed.

“The slight concessions in the final version of the legislation, which became clear only after experts had a chance to parse the fine print, suggest that at least some Republican lawmakers were aware that cuts in the bill would strike their constituents the hardest,” the New York Times reports. “Democratic legislation in 2022 inspired a boom in construction of battery factories and electric vehicle plants, primarily in Southern states where Republicans dominate.”

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” the company said. “BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit—a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

Speaking of fairness, Ford Executive Chairman William Ford Jr. told the Times that he and other execs were in touch with the White House almost daily, arguing that withdrawal of financial support promised by the Biden administration was unfair. “We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place,” said Mr. Ford. “It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_624858275-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:32:54.798823

The Commonwealth is investing more than US$1.27 million to support the project.

Since taking office, Governor Shapiro has made Pennsylvania more competitive and business-friendly, securing more than US$25.2 billion in private sector investments and nearly 11 000 new jobs. Through the Commonwealth’s first Economic Development Strategy in nearly two decades, historic site development funding, and streamlined permitting and licensing, the Shapiro Administration is delivering real results and attracting cutting-edge companies like Verne.

“Pennsylvania is making strategic investments to grow our innovation, energy, and manufacturing industries, and Verne clearly recognised that our Commonwealth is competing again because they chose us over Ohio, Michigan, and West Virginia for its first manufacturing facility in the country,” said Governor Shapiro. “My Administration is proud to win deal like this that strengthen our local communities, grow our manufacturing sector, and position Pennsylvania as a national leader in innovation and job creation. We’re competing aggressively for private sector investment – and Pennsylvania is open for business.”

Verne developed a process to increase the density of hydrogen by storing the gas in a cold-and-compressed state, making it more efficient to transport in larger volumes. Scaling up to commercial operations, the company will manufacture hydrogen storage vessels at its new facility in the Marcellus Energy Park in Muncy, partnering with local manufacturers to leverage their expertise in critical processes. Verne’s storage and transportation vessels will help Pennsylvania expand its nation-leading energy sector, which includes an exceptionally strong natural gas industry.

To support the project, the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) provided the company with a funding offer that includes a US$1 million Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA) loan, a US$153 000 Pennsylvania First grant, and a US$122 000 WEDnetPA grant to help train its new employees. The company can also apply for Research and Development tax credits, which could provide additional benefits.

“This investment in Verne is another example of how the Shapiro Administration is diversifying our energy sector while fostering innovation and supporting the Commonwealth’s vital manufacturing industry,” said DCED Secretary Rick Siger. “It also shows what Governor Shapiro’s 10-year Economic Development Strategy is achieving – firmly establishing Pennsylvania’s status as a leader in innovation, economic development, and job creation.”

Founded in San Francisco in 2020, Verne provides modern energy distribution solutions for sectors including construction, data centres, drilling, ports and more. Verne is supported by the US Department of Energy, the US Army, and many major companies across the country.

“After conducting a nationwide search, we determined that North Central Pennsylvania was the perfect place to establish our manufacturing footprint. The proximity to key partners in the region was a crucial factor, as it will allow Verne to leverage their expertise to optimise our supply chain and manufacturing processes,” commented Ted McKlveen, Verne Co-founder & CEO. “This facility will accelerate our impact in delivering energy to power critical industries that are currently not being served by our nation’s electricity grid.”

“We are pleased to see Verne locating their first manufacturing operation here in Lycoming County at the Marcellus Energy Park,” added Jason Fink, President and CEO, Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce. “Lycoming County and Pennsylvania are the perfect fit for this hydrogen sector development. We not only have the natural resources but also the talent required from in-state colleges and universities to support and grow with them. This is yet another example of how the local and regional economic development organisations work together with BusinessPA to get things done in bringing new industry to Pennsylvania.”

“Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania is pleased to see Verne, Inc. expanding at the Marcellus Energy Park, and we look forward to continuing our support of their growth there,” stated Josh Bradley, Regional Manager, Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania. “Their innovative approach to hydrogen storage aligns with our mission to support advanced manufacturing and clean energy technologies that drive sustainable growth in Pennsylvania.”",https://d3vavkuuuw54vu.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/hydrogen-green-tank-01.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:28:38.051287

Expiring on Sep. 30: Credits on EVs

Anyone looking to take a big bite out of their emissions has to consider trading their gas-powered car for an EV. About 37% of U.S. emissions come from transportation—and 21% of those come from individual drivers’ cars. Tax credits can give you an assist in making the switch. Eligible vehicles can earn a credit of up to $7,500, and used rides can get up to to $4,000. There are, of course, stipulations around the specific car you buy (for instance, the credit is limited to vehicles that meet requirements about where they’re built) and how much you make.

Expiring on Dec. 31: Credits on heat pumps, water heaters, and more

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit applies to nearly a dozen different items that could improve the overall efficiency of a home. These include swaps like replacing old windows and doors, whole-home projects like improving insulation and air sealing, or HVAC upgrades like installing a heat pump. Depending on what you do, there’s up to $2,000 in available credit for anything installed before the end of the year.

Through the Commonwealth's first Economic Development Strategy in nearly two decades, historic site development funding, and streamlined permitting and licensing, the Shapiro Administration is delivering real results and attracting cutting-edge companies like Verne.

Verne developed a process to increase the density of hydrogen by storing the gas in a cold-and-compressed state, making it more efficient to transport in larger volumes. Scaling up to commercial operations, the company will manufacture hydrogen storage vessels at its new facility in the Marcellus Energy Park in Muncy, partnering with local manufacturers to leverage their expertise in critical processes.

Verne’s storage and transportation vessels will help Pennsylvania expand its nation-leading energy sector, which includes an exceptionally strong natural gas industry. To support the project, the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) provided the company with a funding offer that includes a $1 million Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA) loan, a $153,000 Pennsylvania First grant, and a $122,000 WEDnetPA grant to help train its new employees. The company can also apply for Research and Development tax credits, which could provide additional benefits.

""After conducting a nationwide search, we determined that North Central Pennsylvania was the perfect place to establish our manufacturing footprint,"" said Ted McKlveen, Verne co-founder and CEO.

""Pennsylvania is making strategic investments to grow our innovation, energy, and manufacturing industries, and Verne clearly recognized that our Commonwealth is competing again because they chose us over Ohio, Michigan, and West Virginia for its first manufacturing facility in the country,"" said Shapiro.

Our grid depends on it. | Utility Dive,"Ethan Howland, Andrew Waranch",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ferc-competitive-power-markets-ipp-spearmint/752852/,"The efficacy of all this work, however, depends on one fundamental question: Will the electric grid of the future be determined by free market competition or by monopoly utilities?
The dismal performance of monopoly utilities shows how important that choice will be.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission created competitive power markets in the 1990s to provide a check on monopoly utilities’ out-of-control costs.
In the ensuing decades, FERC has cultivated a growing, competitive segment of independent power producers by safeguarding “open access” to the electric grid for private developers.
These companies have brought innovation, efficiency, lower costs and significant capital to the electricity market.","Andrew Waranch is president and CEO of Spearmint Energy, an energy storage company.

The U.S. electric grid is on the cusp of generational growth. The industrial shifts that will reshape the global economy and create the next generation of American jobs all need electricity, and lots of it. After decades of stagnation, demand for electricity in the U.S. is projected to increase by more than 15% by 2029.

A national effort to promote investment in reliable energy infrastructure is underway, as seen in President Donald Trump’s Council on Energy Dominance and various state and federal initiatives. The efficacy of all this work, however, depends on one fundamental question: Will the electric grid of the future be determined by free market competition or by monopoly utilities?

The dismal performance of monopoly utilities shows how important that choice will be. Monopoly utilities and their state regulators have presided over a 20-year run of electric rates that have risen faster than inflation, with electricity prices rising by a whopping 6.3% annual growth rate since 2022, more than 280 points above the Consumer Price Index. The expected increase in natural gas prices in coming years will only drive electric bills higher at a time when government leaders continue to fight inflation.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission created competitive power markets in the 1990s to provide a check on monopoly utilities’ out-of-control costs. In the ensuing decades, FERC has cultivated a growing, competitive segment of independent power producers by safeguarding “open access” to the electric grid for private developers. These companies have brought innovation, efficiency, lower costs and significant capital to the electricity market.

The value of IPPs is on display in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas power market, where streamlined regulatory processes have created the conditions for robust competition, and where load growth began in earnest five years ago. IPPs in ERCOT have led the way in bringing new generating resources online to help serve record-breaking load while also improving reliability and lowering costs for consumers. Since 2021, Texas has added 44 GW of generation to the grid — over 90% of which came from solar, wind and battery energy storage system (BESS) assets. This diverse resource mix, driven by competitive power producers, has already proven its economic worth: According to FERC’s latest projections, wholesale electricity prices in ERCOT will be lower this summer than they were in 2024. In every other market, prices are expected to increase.

The load growth in ERCOT will soon spread to the rest of the U.S. As in Texas, IPPs are ready. Thousands of projects representing hundreds of gigawatts of electricity — including BESS, renewables and conventional thermal generation — are under development across the country and could provide enough resources to power U.S. economic growth for decades to come.

But IPPs can only move as fast as regulatory processes allow. These processes are managed by the regional transmission organizations that coordinate grid planning across state lines. RTOs are regulated by FERC and chartered to protect power market competition, but they are also beholden to the resource planning of monopoly utilities and governed by boards and committees in which utility interests have IPPs outnumbered, and outvoted. While IPPs are ready to bring new power onto the grid, in recent months it has become painfully clear that utilities, and the RTOs under their influence, are not.

To connect a new resource to the grid in most markets, IPPs must obtain a generator interconnection agreement (GIA) from an RTO. Developers may wait as long as four years for a GIA for a single project, a dismal experience for which they pay millions of dollars. These delays are the product of underfunding and neglect on the part of utilities, which have spent decades operating as though electricity demand would remain flat forever.

Citing these backlogged interconnection “queues,” utilities and RTOs have noted they are not prepared to meet the rising demand they will soon be expected to serve. Instead of working to enhance competitive interconnection processes, utilities and RTOs have closed ranks and devised “emergency” plans that empower utilities to handpick projects to cut to the front of the queue. The PJM Interconnection, the RTO that serves the mid-Atlantic, initiated its FERC-approved “Reliability Resource Initiative” earlier this year, which changed established rules to let select projects jump to the front of the line.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/cquGYsm9F2YsO4zbHf1guWsvyfUpdtOKquQGDCQJ2kM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9SMzNSNjcuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-14 12:33:04.905330

A slide in sales could also impact employment for manufacturers and installers, said Bill Johnson, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association and founder of Sarasota-based solar company Brilliant Harvest.
“It’s just a matter of letting the dust settle when [the ending tax credit] happens.” That’s also just speculation, Tourlakes adds.
“Who knows?” Stilwell Solar’s Miller points to solar panels’ benefits as a potential hedge against utility price increases and a resilient power source after storms.","With a 30% federal tax credit on residential solar panels set to expire Dec. 31, industry professionals are bracing for impacts that may include a downturn in business next year and a short-term spike in sales as consumers purchase solar panel systems before the deadline.

“I hope for [solar companies] there is going to be a nice big spur during this next six-month push,” said Kelly Miller of Stilwell Solar, a Southwest Florida service company based in Estero. “It’s kind of like stores having their final going out of business sale.”

But she adds, “I think when you have a great product it keeps going and people continue to want it. So, we’re not going anywhere.”

While speculation about the new rule’s impact is not all negative, concerns remain about how it could shake up the solar industry as companies prepare for a market without the long-running credit. It began in 2005 and was set to phase out by 2034 under the Inflation Reduction Act before being eliminated as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill signed into law July 4.

One effect of ending the credit could be a buildup of supply for manufacturers as demand for panels goes down. Hopefully, Miller said, that would in turn bring prices down on equipment to soften the blow for installers and in turn their customers.

A slide in sales could also impact employment for manufacturers and installers, said Bill Johnson, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association and founder of Sarasota-based solar company Brilliant Harvest. “We’re probably not going to be hiring like we would have, and the industry is not going to grow like it would have.”

That 30% credit is “a significant chunk of change,” said Dominick Zito, co-owner of Florida Solar Design Group in Fort Myers. Roughly estimated, tax rebates for his customers have ranged from $12,000 for small systems to $40,000 or more for larger ones. While Zito said he has seen an uptick in recent business due to the ending credit, he expects to take a hit in the coming year.

“It’s a dramatic effect, a huge detrimental effect on communities because we’re local, all our employees are full-time employees,” he said. “If peoples’ solar businesses are down 30%, 40%, 60% (and) there’s no work, there is that much less work for employees.”

Orlando-based solar company Soligo has been training employees in HVAC and roofing for several years over concerns that the tax credits might end, said Josh Randolph, the company’s chief marketing officer. “We’re hopeful that the solar industry will still survive but we are expecting some big changes to happen.”

People who are interested in getting panels installed before the deadline are calling Cape Coral-based Solar Energy Solutions of America on a daily basis. If a loan for a solar panel system used to take about seven years to pay for itself in energy cost savings, it could take nine or so without the tax credit, said Adam Tourlakes, the company’s sales manager.

“Which still makes it attractive to a lot of people,” he said. “It’s just a matter of letting the dust settle when [the ending tax credit] happens.”

That’s also just speculation, Tourlakes adds. “Who knows?”

Stilwell Solar’s Miller points to solar panels’ benefits as a potential hedge against utility price increases and a resilient power source after storms.

“Elimination of [the credit] does push the return on your investment in purchasing solar out a few more years, but the elimination of paying for your electricity is instant, as is the appreciation of the value of your home,” she said.

Eliminating the credit could also impact how quickly the U.S. is able to expand renewable energy compared to other countries.

“The reality is that this is a global competition and countries that we are not friendly with right now, China in particular, they are moving forward as fast as they can on renewable energy,” said FlaSEIA’s Johnson.",https://www.gulfshorebusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PV-Isles-of-Collier-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:30:38.771756

“The Governor has made it clear she’s taking an all-of-the-above approach to energy that prioritizes affordability, reliability, and sustainability,” said Ken Lovett, a spokesperson for Hochul.","Good morning and welcome to the weekly Monday edition of the New York & New Jersey Energy newsletter. We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

LABOR CHEERS HOCHUL ENERGY APPROACH — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Gov. Kathy Hochul’s “all of the above” approach to meet New York’s increasing energy needs has been slammed by environmental groups.

But the Democrat’s recent embrace of new nuclear energy and growing openness to gas pipelines has exhilarated many in the labor movement — particularly those who have long worried the state’s transition to clean energy would harm their members.

“We are appreciative of the fact that she’s taking a second look at these issues,” said John Samuelsen, president of Transport Workers Union International, which represents over 160,000 workers including some in the utility industry.

“She’s probably going to have a heart attack if she reads me saying that. It’s probably the first positive thing I’ve said about Hochul publicly in years.”

The Democratic governor faces a potentially tough reelection fight next year, including a progressive primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor and two Republican members of Congress eyeing campaigns. Hochul wants to run on delivering affordability and energy costs are a key piece of that message, although environmentalists say the costs of nuclear and gas infrastructure will ultimately raise bills.

Her rhetoric aligns with a national shift among Democrats who are struggling to implement ambitious climate policies with near-term price tags for consumers.

Hochul’s shift on energy policy includes continuing to subsidize renewables while also announcing plans to build a new nuclear plant in New York and expressing openness to gas pipelines and power plants. The moves largely align with what some labor unions, particularly in the energy sector, have wanted to see since passage of New York’s 2019 climate law.

HARD ROAD ALONE: Gov. Kathy Hochul echoed a longtime talking point of New York Republicans and business groups on the state’s climate law Friday — they have argued New York shouldn’t bear the brunt of costs of climate action when the state’s emissions are only a fraction of the global problem.

“We are very focused on making sure that we do our part, but other states have to play a role as well — you think about that — so one state cannot solve the climate crisis,” Hochul told reporters at an event on weather related disasters.

It’s part of an ongoing rhetorical shift by Hochul, who has for years been raising concerns about the cost of the state’s climate law for New York residents while saying she’s still committed to making progress.

The governor earlier this month touted how she is “slowing down” the climate law because of affordability concerns. On Friday, she blamed President Donald Trump, who took office months after her own officials acknowledged they wouldn’t meet the near-term 2030 renewable goal.

“Those goals remain. They’re statutory. I believe we’ll hit many of them, especially our longer term ones,” Hochul said. “Unfortunately, because of decisions made in Washington, I believe that there’ll be a setback in some of the initiatives.”

The president’s reconciliation bill included major cuts and quicker phase-outs for renewable energy tax credits.

“These goals were based on, predicated on, offshore wind and solar really emerging as primary energy sources, but I have to deal with the reality [of a] president that’s hostile to those interests,” Hochul said. “I’m just dealing in reality here.” — Marie J. French

GASSING UP ASSEMBLY DEMS: A climate advocacy group plans to run a digital campaign thanking Assembly Democrats who voted for the elimination of the “100-foot rule.” The measure, if Gov. Kathy Hochul signs it, would end subsidies for a portion of the cost of new gas hookups that are currently paid by all ratepayers. The change only affects residential buildings, and would make it more expensive for new or existing homes to connect to the natural gas system. It was an incremental step in environmentalists’ efforts to transition the state off gas — and the only part of a more sweeping measure that garnered enough support in the Assembly to come to a vote.

Spring Street Climate Fund is spending five figures on the digital ads. The straightforward “thank you” for “ending the 100-foot rule: cleaner heat and lower bills” will run for all 83 Assembly Democrats who voted for the measure in the final days of session in Albany. Spring Street earlier in the session said they’d run ads against Assembly Democrats they viewed as holdouts against the broader gas transition measure, NY HEAT, if it was not included in the budget. That spurred backlash from some Assemblymembers, including one co-sponsor who took her name off the bill. That plan was dropped and Assembly Democrats held several conferences to discuss the measure. Ultimately, they passed the standalone elimination of the 100-foot rule.

“Assembly members from all over New York voted for a climate bill that will save money for utility customers, and their constituents should know that,” said John Raskin, president of Spring Street Climate Fund, in a statement. “Holding lawmakers accountable isn’t just about letting constituents know when their representatives are doing wrong. When lawmakers vote for bills that will help their constituents, people in their district need to know.”

Supporters of the 100-foot-rule measure say it’s fair to make those hooking up to the system pay for the full cost of new pipeline and that the change will ultimately save ratepayers money.

Opponents of eliminating the 100-foot rule argue it could raise the cost of new homes and are planning their campaign to push Hochul to veto the bill. The governor previously backed the change, although she didn’t include it in her budget proposal this year. Business groups, homebuilders, labor unions representing workers on the gas system, gas-only utility National Fuel Gas and other fossil fuel companies oppose eliminating the rule. New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, which is backed by National Fuel Gas and others, will pressure the governor to reject the measure. — Marie J. French

DEMOCRATS RETREAT ON CLIMATE — POLITICO’s Jeremy B. White and Camille von Kaenel: Donald Trump is coming for California’s signature climate policies — and so is California.

Stung by the party’s sweeping losses in November and desperate to win back working-class voters, the Democratic Party is in retreat on climate change. Nowhere is that retrenchment more jarring than in the nation’s most populous state, a longtime bastion of progressive politics on the environment.

NORTHEAST CARBON TRADING EXTENDED — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: The nation’s oldest cap-and-trade program will further ratchet down emissions from power plants in the Northeast under new targets agreed to by 10 states.

The planned updates to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, released earlier this month will reduce the cap for carbon emissions from the power sector by at least 60 percent in 2037 compared to the 2025 level. Environmental advocates praised the step forward after lengthy negotiations among the states.

The plan to extend the cap-and-trade program will continue emissions reductions since the bipartisan multistate agreement launched in 2009. Environmental advocates see it as evidence of crucial state leadership on climate as President Donald Trump rolls back federal initiatives.

“This new announcement … further demonstrates the critical role states can and will continue to play on climate and clean energy leadership, and despite the setbacks at the federal level, it’s a prime example of how we can continue to make progress,” said Jackson Morris, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s director of state power sector policy.

NUCLEAR COST CONCERNS — POLITICO’s Debra Kahn: Nuclear power is a political winner — but not a money saver…

The hippies are dying out, and with them the memories of Shoreham, San Onofre, V.C. Summer, Three Mile Island and other nuclear plants that didn’t pan out, suffered radiation leaks or otherwise closed before their time (although they live on, in many cases, in electric bills).

Amid a broader global flirtation with the technology, Democrats across the country, driven by demand projections as well as climate concerns, are now joining Republicans in pushing for a nuclear resurgence — and there hasn’t been a partisan backlash.

BIG BATTERY BET: While major generation projects, like offshore wind farms, have stalled in New Jersey, the state is starting to bet big on batteries.

Clean energy advocates hope that by storing power when demand is down and it’s cheaper, the state can shave down the price spikes in the PJM market.

Moira Cyphers, who directs the trade group’s eastern state affairs for American Clean Power, which is backing the storage push, said there are 1.2 GW of near-term projects that could be ready to go in 2-4 years and 3.7 GW in later years, according to self-reported numbers from its members and a look at the PJM queue.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the Legislature have both recently advanced major energy storage program. The BPU in June approved the first phase of what officials hope will be 2 GW by 2030, including 350 MW in projects awarded by the end of the year — goals that are in line with something Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has previously wanted. Even as the agency’s clean energy money is being taken in Murphy’s budget, the BPU has $125 million to spend on storage from the settlement with Orsted, though the wind industry thinks it shouldn’t all be spent on batteries.

Lawmakers also sent Murphy a bill that requires the BPU to run a transmission-scale energy storage program with at least $60 million in annual incentives for developers and sets a target of 1 GW by the end of 2026. Its sponsors include the chairs of both energy-related committees in the Legislature, Assemblymember Wayne DeAngelo and Sen. Bob Smith.

Cyphers said Maryland is doing a similar push that comes as states try to “stretch capacity on the grid.”

Right now there is about 100 MW of storage in New Jersey compared to much larger capacity in states with lots of wind and solar, like 2 GW in Arizona, 9 GW in Texas and 12 GW in California. — Ry Rivard

NY GOP CALLS FOR ‘ENERGY EMERGENCY’: New York Republican lawmakers want Gov. Kathy Hochul to declare a state of emergency and suspend the state’s 2019 climate law. Senate Republicans sent a letter to the governor on Thursday calling for immediate action “in response to escalating reliability concerns surrounding our electric grid and the rapidly rising energy costs burdening New York ratepayers.” The letter says the state mandates for electrification and more renewables are raising energy bills and increasing strain on the grid. “Legislation stemming from the [climate law], including mandates for electric vehicles, electric school buses, electric buildings, the repeal of the ‘100-foot rule,’ and a Cap-and-Invest program risks overloading the grid at a time when demand is growing and reliable energy supply is increasingly constrained,” the letter states.

The letter notes the New York Independent System Operator issued energy warnings when operating reserves fell to lower than usual levels earlier this summer. The warnings were part of a new system set up this year and the NYISO indicated there was still enough energy to meet the state’s needs. The grid operator has warned of tightening reliability margins statewide, although its latest long-term forecast did not find a shortfall.

The governor, at a diner in western New York earlier this month, said she was “slowing down” the climate law’s implementation. “We cannot accomplish what those objectives were back before I became governor in a timeframe that’s gonna not hurt ratepayers,” she said. “Utility costs are a huge burden on families and I’ll do whatever I can to relieve — alleviate that.”

Hochul has already indicated the state is not on track to meet the near-term goals in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Her administration has delayed enforcement of the state’s electric vehicle sales mandate, punted indefinitely on implementing “cap and invest” and signed a budget allowing more flexibility for school districts to electrify their fleets. The state has only reduced emissions by about 9.4 percent from 1990 levels as of the most recent data, and is not on track to reduce emissions by 40 percent until at least 2036. The climate law calls for hitting that level by 2030.

The Republicans’ letter cites a high-end cost estimate from the state’s climate plan as a “conservative” estimate of the CLCPA’s costs — about $340 billion in 2020 dollars. Hochul officials have previously said the societal benefits outweigh the costs, based on that modeling. The benefits include avoiding greenhouse gas emissions and health savings, which won’t show up on people’s utility bills. They also cite New York’s high residential electricity rates, which are about 47 percent higher than the national average, according to federal data. New Yorkers use less electricity than residents of other states. A recently released NYSERDA analysis found New York households spend less than the national average on energy — including utilities and transportation.

“We further advocate for an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy policy that does not rely solely on wind and solar but also embraces dependable energy sources,” the Senate Republican letter says. Hochul has publicly embraced additional energy sources, including new nuclear energy and her administration has also expressed more openness to natural gas power plants in recent weeks.

“The Governor has made it clear she’s taking an all-of-the-above approach to energy that prioritizes affordability, reliability, and sustainability,” said Ken Lovett, a spokesperson for Hochul. “Rather than grandstanding, these legislators would be better off spending their time pushing back against the massive cuts their colleagues in Washington pushed through that will devastate their communities here in New York.”

Rollbacks of federal incentives for clean energy are likely to raise costs for New York ratepayers to achieve the state’s climate goals. State analysts previously estimated the Inflation Reduction Act could lower New York’s costs to achieve its targets by $70 billion or nearly 20 percent through 2050. Major components of that Biden-era legislation are being canceled or phased out more quickly under President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” NYSERDA hasn’t yet completed an analysis of the impacts.

“NYSERDA is still reviewing the Federal Reconciliation Bill and its impacts, but the new law puts thousands of jobs at risk and could cut billions in funding and impact overall market momentum,” said authority spokesperson Kate Muller. “This bill undermines New York State’s demonstrated leadership in advancing clean energy technologies as a part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy including investments in wind, solar, hydroelectric, and nuclear power to create a clean, affordable, and reliable energy grid.”

Environmental advocates want to see Hochul step up investments in renewables and clean energy in response to Trump’s cuts. NY Renews executive director Stephan Edel said New York should move forward with “cap and invest,” a cap-and-trade style program to charge for pollution and invest the money in transitioning off fossil fuels. Edel said Hochul shouldn’t leave that revenue source on the table. “If we’re losing the production tax credit, if we’re losing federal incentives, the state either has to say we’re just not going to make meaningful efforts or it has to put some money down,” he said. — Marie J.

Now, a newly passed federal spending bill has pulled the plug. President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” ends EV and plug-in hybrid tax credits on September 30, 2025. That leaves consumers a tight summer window to cash in on savings​ up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used models​ before Washington slams the vault shut.

And make no mistake: this is no temporary pause. It’s one of the most aggressive federal walk-backs on electrification policy to date. If you’re shopping for an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, the clock’s ticking​ and so is your potential to save thousands.

How does it compare to rivals?

The biggest rival right now isn’t another car​ it’s time. Only around 20 models qualify for full federal incentives, due to complicated rules around domestic manufacturing, battery sourcing, and price caps under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, and Tesla Model 3, Y, and Cybertruck still make the cut. Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 sneak in via leasing, thanks to a quirk in the legislation that awards credits to the leasing company rather than the buyer.

This leasing loophole has become the industry’s clever workaround. Many models that don’t qualify for tax credits under direct purchase​ such as foreign-built EVs​ can still benefit from credits if leased. The catch? It’s up to the leasing company to pass those savings along, and not all do. So shoppers should ask pointedly before signing anything with an “APR” on it.

Who is this for​ and who should skip it?

If you’ve been on the EV fence, this summer may be your best shot to leap off it. New electric vehicles remain expensive​ the average EV sells for about $63,000, a solid $13,000 more than a comparable gas-powered model. Tax credits helped narrow that gap for many buyers. Come October, they’ll be gone, leaving price-conscious shoppers to either pay full freight or wait for automakers to lower MSRPs voluntarily.

Shoppers looking at “affordable” EVs should be especially aware. The Chevy Equinox EV, touted as a sub-$30K electric crossover after incentives, could see its effective price jump by several thousand dollars this fall. And Slate Auto​ , a startup promising a $19,900 EV​ , recently updated its pricing to “mid-twenties.” Surprise, surprise. The base model budget EV is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

On the flip side, buyers who prioritize performance, luxury, or tech over price may shrug. For them, EV adoption isn’t just about cost​ it’s about experience. But don’t expect those tax credits to return soon. The political winds have shifted, and Washington’s wallet is staying closed.

Iredale and James McAuliffe, who is a partner at Solway, first presented their idea to build solar canopies along highway medians to former Gov.
Iredale and McAuliffe’s idea sparked when they were working for a different solar company, building canopies over MBTA parking lots.
“There are no wetlands, wildlife, or nature issues.” Compared to other more rural municipalities, Lexington does not have much solar, McAuliffe noted.
There are about 398 more miles of highway median that can take this type of solar development in Massachusetts.","A five-megawatt solar canopy that will span about two miles may be built along the Route 2 median in Lexington next year as a part of a pilot program Gov. Maura Healey nicknamed the “Green Mile.”

Something similar exists in South Korea along a bicycle path, but this would be the first highway median solar project in the United States.

“Let it begin here,” John Iredale, founder of Solway Development, the Weymouth-based energy infrastructure development company that will develop the canopies, said to LexObserver, quoting Capt. John Parker’s famous Battle of Lexington speech.

Iredale and James McAuliffe, who is a partner at Solway, first presented their idea to build solar canopies along highway medians to former Gov. Charlie Baker. He was supportive of the concept, they said, but it was shelved when the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Healey picked it back up when she was voted into office.

Iredale and McAuliffe’s idea sparked when they were working for a different solar company, building canopies over MBTA parking lots. Iredale realized highway medians are essentially unused land that sometimes exist close to cities.

“When you’re a solar developer and you’re looking for land to put solar on, you can go out to Western Massachusetts, but that doesn’t really serve the communities in the Greater Boston area,” McAuliffe noted. “We’re always looking for land that isn’t being used…it really was, ‘look at this land in the middle of Lexington, and all of these other communities, that is just ripe for solar.’”

Solway has been working with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, or MassDOT, to get the “Green Mile” up and running.

“Solar is the fastest and most affordable way to bring clean energy to Massachusetts — and MassDOT is proud to be part of the solution,” Monica Tibbits‑Nutt, secretary and CEO of MassDOT, told the Observer. “This innovative project will generate enough affordable electricity to power thousands of homes across the Commonwealth.”

The state’s transportation department looked at various highway medians across the state. The strip of land in Lexington checked all their boxes.

“It’s a really nice site,” said McAuliffe. “There are no wetlands, wildlife, or nature issues.”

Compared to other more rural municipalities, Lexington does not have much solar, McAuliffe noted. So this program would not put much pressure on the local power grid.

“The only solar you’re going to have in Lexington is rooftop solar and maybe some canopies over parking lots, but not like 25 acres of a solar array because the real estate is just too valuable,” he said. “The grid can take it fairly easily.”

Solway will lease the land from the state for the next 20 years with support from the state’s SMART program (an incentive program where utility companies compensate solar owners for the electricity their systems produce) and investors.

Investors have long benefitted from putting their money into solar because of the federal government’s solar tax credit, which has existed, in some capacity, since 2005.

In the early aughts, residents could get a 30 percent credit (up to $2,000) for their solar panels. A 2008 law aimed at stabilizing Wall Street removed that $2,000 limit. According to recent data from the IRS, the average consumer gets about $8,000 back for their installation, the Washington Post reported.

The tax credit was supposed to last another 10 years under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. But President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” which he signed into law last week, slashed the solar tax credit.

“The solar industry is going to be scrambling to figure out how to make solar projects work,” McAuliffe said.

The Trump Administration’ new policy won’t affect any solar projects that begin construction before July 4, 2026, however. Iredale and McAuliffe are confident construction on their pilot program will be underway before then.

So far, the land has been secured by a letter of interest. Solway has been working with Eversource on their interconnection agreement for about a year (they expect it to be completed in the next six months or so) and they’ve met with Lexington stakeholders.

“Members of town staff…are excited to see this kind of innovative project proposed in Lexington,” Maggie Peard, Lexington’s sustainability and resilience officer, told the Observer. “Especially in dense areas, there are a lot of competing uses for areas where solar could be installed, so using space like a highway median that can’t be used for anything else would be a big win for renewable energy.”

The Solway founders estimate drivers will see the canopies along Route 2 by fall 2026.

There are about 398 more miles of highway median that can take this type of solar development in Massachusetts. If all goes well with the pilot program, Iredale and McAuliffe intend to expand their project to that unused land.

“If we could do all 400 miles, that’s equal to about one nuclear power plant…which could power hundreds of thousands of homes,” said McAuliffe.

But the timing of building the canopies along those 398 other miles of land likely won’t line up with the federal government’s slashing of the solar tax credit. There could be less of a financial incentive for investors to support the project.

If it all works out, the “Green Mile” could set an example for the rest of the nation.

“One Massachusetts will fit into Pennsylvania four times. If you start to do that math on that across the country, you can do a lot, and that’s all starting with a little project in Lexington, Massachusetts,” Iredale said.

The Solway founders will host a virtual public meeting on Thursday, July 17 from 6 to 7 p.m. to get the word about their project out to Lexington residents.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats and Republicans don’t agree on much, but they share a conviction that the government should help American manufacturers, one way or another.

Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers. Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes — tariffs — around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.

The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.

The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.

“The past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,’’ said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. “We didn’t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we’ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.’’

Big economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.

Government policy was meant to help.

Biden’s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom – investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 – that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.

But the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden’s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, “manufacturing production will continue to flatline.”

“If production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,” Zandi said. “Manufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.’’

Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers — and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America — by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.

In some ways, Trump’s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But “when you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,’’ Zuzick said. “So that’s definitely a situation where it’s beneficial.’’

But American factories import and use foreign products, too – machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.

Consider steel. Trump’s tariffs don’t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices – and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.

In fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France — and pay Trump’s tariff.

Trump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.

The flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: “Customers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,’’ a fabricated metal products company said.

“Tariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,’’ added a computer and electronics firm. “The situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.’’

Some may argue that things aren’t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they’ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.

Factories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.

Suddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off – and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 — the most since 1994 — and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.

But in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.

In the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.

“It’s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,’’ said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden’s White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products said that it will take time to see if Trump’s tariffs succeed in bringing factories back to America.

“The fact is that manufacturing doesn’t turn on a dime,’’ he said. “It takes time to switch gears.’’

Hagopian at Pilot Precision is hopeful that tax breaks in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will help American manufacturing regain momentum.

“There may be light at the end of the tunnel that may not be a locomotive bearing down,’’ he said.

For now, manufacturers are likely to delay big decisions on investing or bringing on new workers until they see where Trump’s tariffs settle and what impact they have on the economy, said Ned Hill, professor emeritus in economic development at Ohio State University.

“With all this uncertainty about what the rest of the year is going to look like,’’ he said, “there’s a hesitancy to hire people just to lay them off in the near future.’’

“Everyone,’’ said Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products, ”is kind of just waiting for the new normal.’’",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/O-49.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:39:32.912177

Spearheaded by the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA), the event is being organized in collaboration with Avendus, EAAA Alternatives, and Singularity Capital. The summit aims to foster high-impact discussions between investors, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and energy innovators to support India’s push toward a low-carbon future.

The timing of the summit is significant. As global attention intensifies around climate change, energy resilience, and sustainable growth, India continues to emerge as a top destination for renewable energy investments. In 2024 alone, clean energy accounted for over 80% of new investments in the power sector. The country has already reached 44% non-fossil fuel capacity and is steadily working toward the national goal of achieving 50% renewable energy by 2030.

The summit will bring together a distinguished mix of domestic and global investors, regulators, clean technology companies, energy developers, and senior government officials. Discussions will focus on removing capital bottlenecks, exploring next-generation energy technologies, and enabling stronger public-private partnerships to accelerate India’s clean energy shift.

Aakriti Bamniyal, Senior Vice President at IVCA, emphasized the event’s relevance, stating, “India’s clean energy goals are not just climate targets—they represent a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity. This summit will spotlight how alternative capital can be a catalyst for collaboration, innovation, and long-term resilience.”

Featured speakers include Ananth Narayan G, Whole-Time Member of SEBI, and Vishal Kumar Dev, Principal Secretary, Energy Department, Government of Odisha. Panel sessions will explore financing models for renewable infrastructure, the role of clean energy in enabling emerging sectors like green hydrogen, EVs, and AI, and innovations in grid management, storage systems, and hybrid energy models.

Prateek Jhawar, Managing Director at Avendus, highlighted that energy transition will require sustained annual investments of over USD 300 billion, a tenfold jump from current levels. “India needs nearly USD 15 trillion by 2070 to meet its net-zero targets. The summit offers a critical opportunity to align capital with climate priorities and unlock momentum across sectors like electric mobility, sustainable fuels, and circular economy,” he noted.

Subahoo Chordia, Co-CEO of EAAA Alternatives, shared that while India has made rapid progress—from under 10% to almost 50% renewables in the energy mix—scaling up remains key. With $150–$200 billion needed over the next five years, the role of institutional investors and fund managers will be central in bridging this gap.

Suyash Kela, Partner at Singularity, added that the clean energy transition is not only essential for the environment but also a core component of India’s economic and strategic future. “Supporting entrepreneurs who are building scalable clean energy solutions is critical for long-term national growth.

How does it compare to rivals?

The biggest rival right now isn’t another car​ it’s time. Only around 20 models qualify for full federal incentives, due to complicated rules around domestic manufacturing, battery sourcing, and price caps under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, and Tesla Model 3, Y, and Cybertruck still make the cut. Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 sneak in via leasing, thanks to a quirk in the legislation that awards credits to the leasing company rather than the buyer.

This leasing loophole has become the industry’s clever workaround. Many models that don’t qualify for tax credits under direct purchase​ such as foreign-built EVs​ can still benefit from credits if leased. The catch? It’s up to the leasing company to pass those savings along, and not all do. So shoppers should ask pointedly before signing anything with an “APR” on it.

Who is this for​ and who should skip it?

If you’ve been on the EV fence, this summer may be your best shot to leap off it. New electric vehicles remain expensive​ the average EV sells for about $63,000, a solid $13,000 more than a comparable gas-powered model. Tax credits helped narrow that gap for many buyers. Come October, they’ll be gone, leaving price-conscious shoppers to either pay full freight or wait for automakers to lower MSRPs voluntarily.

Shoppers looking at “affordable” EVs should be especially aware. The Chevy Equinox EV, touted as a sub-$30K electric crossover after incentives, could see its effective price jump by several thousand dollars this fall. And Slate Auto​ , a startup promising a $19,900 EV​ , recently updated its pricing to “mid-twenties.” Surprise, surprise. The base model budget EV is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

On the flip side, buyers who prioritize performance, luxury, or tech over price may shrug. For them, EV adoption isn’t just about cost​ it’s about experience. But don’t expect those tax credits to return soon. The political winds have shifted, and Washington’s wallet is staying closed.

The analyst updated the firm’s estimates on the Irvine-based EV maker following the report of second quarter deliveries.

Rivian said last week it delivered 10,661 vehicles between April 1 and June 30. The figures lowered year over year, despite a slight increase from the 8,640 units registered in the first quarter.

According to Jewsikow, the new rating on Rivian reflects “softening R1 demand,” which he sees as “a modest negative for R2/R3 volumes,” despite being “confident in cost-reduction targets for the R2.”

Rivian‘s upcoming model, the R2, is set to be launched in the first half of 2026 and to be priced from $45,000.

The firm projects that, with the launch of the R2 and R3 models, Rivian will deliver “150,000 units in 2028,” down from the prior estimate of 185,000.

“We no longer have confidence in the required volumes and/or required ASPs (average selling price) to support our prior price target,” the analyst stated.

Guggenheim has lowered their price target by 18.8%, from $16 to $13. Rivian closed at $13.03 on Friday.

As of the time of writing, the EV maker is trading 2.7% lower at $12.67. Its stock lost 27.6% over the past twelve months.

Jewsikow also noted that “the loss of EV incentives is likely to negatively impact long-term ASP and/or volume potential as well.”

The analyst refers to the recently approved tax cuts prompted by Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” and voted in Congress, according to which the $7,500 credit on EV purchases will end by September 30.

According to Jewsikow, “there are positive offsets in the form of auto interest deduction and a potential EV market void left by competitors canceling EV plans.”

Media outlet Motor1 reported earlier this year that Ford lost $5.1 billion in 2024 with its EV unit ‘Model e’. In the first quarter of 2025, the Detroit automaker reported a first-quarter EBIT loss of $849 million from its fully electric arm.

In April, General Motors announced the temporary half of production in two of its EV plants — in Michigan, US, and in Ontario, Canada.

Legacy German automakers like Audi or Mercedes-Benz have adjusted the timeline of their lineups’ electrification due to weak market demand.

The analyst highlighted that, long-term, “it is possible that Rivian and other tech-focused EV manufacturers benefit as legacy OEMs cede the EV market” to them.

However, “the headwinds presented by changing government incentives present near- and medium-term challenges that are difficult to ignore.”

The analyst said that the upside drivers are not enough to “offset the negative ramifications from lost consumer credits.”

Rivian reported a record gross profit of $206 million in the first quarter, marking its second straight quarter of positive profit, a result that was mainly due to $157 million in revenue from automotive regulatory credit sales.

While the EV maker booked most of regulatory credits in the final quarter last year, it reported half of its full-year guidance for 2025 in the first quarter alone.

Why this matters:

As demand surges from electric vehicles, data centers, and extreme weather, the way the grid is powered becomes a public health issue. Texas, long a symbol of fossil fuel dominance, has emerged as a case study in managing renewables effectively. With battery storage soaking up extra solar and wind energy for use during peak times, the state’s experience suggests renewables can stabilize the grid, not strain it.

The permit backlog has been reduced by 98% since November 2023, decreasing the backlog from over 2,400 permit applications to fewer than 50.

DEP has also conducted more than 58,000 inspections of regulated facilities to ensure compliance with environmental laws. DEP inspections include both scheduled and unscheduled on-site visits to permitted facilities, as well as document reviews to verify compliance with environmental laws and regulations. These inspections – whether on-site or operational – ensure that air emissions stay within air quality standards, drinking water remains safe, and rivers and streams are protected from pollution.

“The Shapiro Administration is committed to getting stuff done – moving our permit reviews at the speed of business without sacrificing environmental protections,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “With new tools like the permit tracker and programs like Streamlining Permits for Economic Expansion and Development (SPEED) DEP will continue provide certainty for Pennsylvania businesses and environmental protection for Pennsylvania communities.”

DEP launched the SPEED program on June 30 for Chp. 102 permit applications. Applications will be accepted later this summer for certain Air Quality Plan Approvals, earth disturbance, dam safety, and individual water obstruction and encroachment permits.

DEP is modernizing its permitting process by investing in new technology and reviewing processes to identify and eliminate bottlenecks. In January, DEP launched a Permit Tracker to allow applicants and residents to monitor the progress of permits as they move through the review process. Since 2023, DEP has also added 225 employees to carry out critical functions like public health and safety inspections and permit application reviews.

Three of the six DEP regional offices (Southwest, South Central, and Southeast) have eliminated their permit backlogs entirely.

DEP reviews more than 45,000 permit applications every year. These include permits for land clearing activities for construction projects, air quality permits for factories and power plants, permits to upgrade drinking waters systems to remove chemicals like PFAS, and permits for oil and gas wells. With more efficient permit review from DEP, businesses in Pennsylvania can put shovels in the ground more quickly while still ensuring their projects meet standards to protect clean air and clean water.

DEP has also implemented the PAyback program, which went into effect in November 2023 that assures a moneyback guarantee for permit applicants if their application is overdue for review by DEP. Since going into effect, DEP has evaluated and decided on more than 68,000 permits without having to refund a single application fee.

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors is planning to produce lower-cost battery cells at its joint-venture plant with South Korea's LG Energy Solution in Tennessee.

The Detroit automaker is rolling out production of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, a technology that is gaining popularity at other automakers in the U.S. including at cross-town rival Ford Motor. GM will begin converting battery cell lines at its Spring Hill, Tennessee facility later this year, and commercial production is expected to begin by late 2027, the company said Monday.

GM and other automakers have pulled back some of their goals around electric vehicle production as demand for the models has been weaker-than-anticipated. Still, auto companies are investing billions in future battery technology and EV production facilities, with the expectation that shoppers will eventually make the switch from traditional gasoline vehicles.

GM currently produces nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum cells at the factory, and will continue to do so at a plant in Ohio. The cells produced in Tennessee are used for EVs made at the neighboring assembly plant, including the Cadillac Lyriq. The factory employs about 1,300 people, GM said. Workers at the Ultium Cells joint-venture factory earlier this year approved their first contract with the United Auto Workers union.

Ford is planning to produce LFP batteries at a factory in Michigan using technology from Chinese battery giant CATL. The plant, announced in 2023, has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company. It is expected to begin production in 2026.

Both automakers are also working on production of lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistries, which are intended to provide drivers with more mileage on their EVs before needing to charge. Concerns around battery range, as well as high vehicle prices, are some of the top barriers keeping customers from buying electric vehicles, auto executives have said.

Indiana-based Electrified Materials, a subsidiary of American Resources, was granted a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permit that allows the company to preprocess and recycle products that contain copper, aluminum, and primarily iron metals as well as minerals and rare earth elements. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management issued the permit.

Electrified Materials recycles lithium-ion batteries from EV motors, among other sources.

EV batteries have both positive and negative impacts on the environment.

EVs, in general, are better for the environment than their gas-powered counterparts because they do not produce tailpipe emissions, which helps reduce air pollution and planet-warming gases. They are a cleaner-energy transportation option, especially if they are charged using renewable energy sources such as solar panels.

The production and disposal of EV batteries, however, have some negative effects on the environment, although the process is improving. The mining of materials can harm the environment, and if the batteries are not properly recycled, they can release toxic materials into the environment, contaminating the soil and water.

Recycling methods that prevent the release of these materials and conserve and reuse them, instead, are ideal.

Electrified Materials will recycle the battery materials and produce mineral concentrates. ReElement Technologies will then refine the concentrates into magnet and battery-grade materials for reuse.

Jensen said that ""this permit, combined with the $900,000+ grant from the State of Indiana and our strategic alignment with ReElement, will accelerate our expansion and strengthen our domestic footprint.""

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors is planning to produce lower-cost battery cells at its joint-venture plant with South Korea's LG Energy Solution in Tennessee.

The Detroit automaker is rolling out production of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, a technology that is gaining popularity at other automakers in the U.S. including at cross-town rival Ford Motor. GM will begin converting battery cell lines at its Spring Hill, Tennessee facility later this year, and commercial production is expected to begin by late 2027, the company said Monday.

GM and other automakers have pulled back some of their goals around electric vehicle production as demand for the models has been weaker-than-anticipated. Still, auto companies are investing billions in future battery technology and EV production facilities, with the expectation that shoppers will eventually make the switch from traditional gasoline vehicles.

GM currently produces nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum cells at the factory, and will continue to do so at a plant in Ohio. The cells produced in Tennessee are used for EVs made at the neighboring assembly plant, including the Cadillac Lyriq. The factory employs about 1,300 people, GM said. Workers at the Ultium Cells joint-venture factory earlier this year approved their first contract with the United Auto Workers union.

Ford is planning to produce LFP batteries at a factory in Michigan using technology from Chinese battery giant CATL. The plant, announced in 2023, has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company. It is expected to begin production in 2026.

Both automakers are also working on production of lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistries, which are intended to provide drivers with more mileage on their EVs before needing to charge. Concerns around battery range, as well as high vehicle prices, are some of the top barriers keeping customers from buying electric vehicles, auto executives have said.

Indeed, on its website, Tesla, which needs to sell cars in general, has a banner saying ""$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending. Take Delivery by September 30, 2025."" Ford, meanwhile, is extending its deal on a free home charger with installation. Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough said in an interview that ""This is certainly a great time to be considering an EV."" However, we would suggest thinking it through, first. But we'll get to that.

American EV Sales Will Hurt

EV sales have already slowed as just about anyone keen to adopt the new technology now has. The great hope for the EV industry has been keeping the tax credits for customers to help keep sales flowing. However, the Trump administration, as promised, has gone to war with EVs, EV charging, and the renewable energy industry. The only winners here have been the oil and petrol companies. ""The $7,500 tax credit is driving demand; without that, that'll slow,"" General Motors CEO Mary Barra warned in December 2024.

According to a joint study between the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University, and Stanford University, electric vehicle registrations could fall as much as 27% without the tax credit. In other countries that have ended consumer incentives, that has been seen already. Germany, particularly, saw a sharp drop in sales when its incentives ended in 2023.

Short Term Gain, Long Term Loss

Analysts predict there will be a bump leading up to the end of the EV tax credit, then a steep drop-off. We've seen a few bumps recently, including to avoid tariff-related price hikes. When manufacturers have lost credits, we've seen them step in with their own incentives before. At one point, GM even offered a $7,500 incentive when it lost its credits due to battery sourcing requirements.

However, that seems unlikely to happen now as production costs are rising. We would say that might be temporary as there are tax credits available for battery production, but the Trump administration is also targeting battery charging and the big slowdown in renewable energy could see the cost of electricity rise.

Buying An EV Now Is A Dice Roll

It's impossible to predict how things will play out, but it's definitely rolling the dice to buy an all-electric vehicle in the US right now. In Democratic states like California, it's possible there will be an increase in state-available incentives. However, if the renewable energy industry collapses across the US like it currently is in Maine, charging is going to get more expensive. If the Trump administration gets its way and ends federally funded EV charging sites, then it's not going to get better when it comes to finding chargers on long journeys.

An even bigger dice roll when it comes to charging is how automakers are moving to Tesla plugs and being able to use Tesla's charging network. Tesla is already hurting for sales and the dead tax credit is going to compound that. Given how Musk has hurt Tesla with his political journey, and now he's enemies with Trump, Tesla's future isn't entirely clear.

In the meantime, it's likely hybrids will continue to be the best-of-both-worlds vehicle that so many buyers are flocking to at the moment. Some plug-in hybrids also qualify for tax credits for now, and some states have separate incentives beyond that.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4-15.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:31:38.611943

The grand opening ceremony on July 14 celebrates one of North America's largest automotive battery plants, which has already begun mass production of 2170 cells.

However, the celebration comes just days after reports that Panasonic plans to delay reaching full production capacity at the facility due to declining electric vehicle sales and shifting U.S. policies under the Trump administration.

Production begins despite scaled-back timeline

The $4 billion facility, built on approximately 300 acres outside Kansas City, represents Panasonic's second North American battery production site. The company has already hired 1,100 employees at the Kansas location and has begun manufacturing operations with plans to eventually reach an annual production capacity of 32 GWh.

When combined with Panasonic's existing Nevada factory (currently at 41 GWh capacity), the Kansas plant would boost the company's total US production capacity to approximately 73 GWh once fully operational. However, according to reports from Nikkei Asia last week, Panasonic is adjusting its timeline for reaching full production.

The plant was originally expected to reach full production by March 2027, but the company has not yet announced a new target date. This adjustment comes as Panasonic's primary customer for these batteries, Tesla, experiences softening demand for electric vehicles in the US market.

Trump administration policies impact EV market

A significant factor in the production delay appears to be recent policy changes under President Trump. His administration's ""big, beautiful bill"" eliminates tax credits for electric vehicle purchases effective September 30, along with reducing or eliminating various green energy incentives.

These policy shifts have created uncertainty in the US electric vehicle market, directly affecting battery suppliers like Panasonic. The timing is particularly challenging as the company launches this massive manufacturing investment.

De Soto Mayor Rick Walker expressed disappointment with the federal approach, stating, ""We have a company reshoring jobs and then every activity [the federal government] takes has worked against that,"" according to the Kansas Reflector. However, he remained optimistic about the overall market trajectory, noting that while projections for EV adoption by 2030 have been scaled back from 50% to 40% of new car sales, ""We're going from less than 10% to 40%. It's still a growth market.""

Advanced manufacturing capabilities

Despite the adjusted timeline, Panasonic's new facility represents a significant technological advancement in battery production. The Kansas factory features labor-saving production lines expected to achieve approximately 20% higher productivity compared to the Nevada facility.

Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu emphasized the strategic importance of the plant during the opening ceremony: ""The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States. This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas,"" according to the company's press release.

The company also plans to introduce products using advanced materials that will increase cell capacity by around 5% in the near future. Panasonic's high-capacity lithium-ion cells feature an industry-leading volumetric energy density of 800 Wh/L and have powered approximately 3.7 million EVs to date.

Economic impact and incentives

As the largest economic development project in Kansas history, the factory was projected to create up to 4,000 direct jobs and approximately 8,000 jobs in total, including those in supplier and related industries. The state offered substantial incentives through its APEX program, with Panasonic expected to receive $829.2 million over 10 years.

The De Soto community also offered incentives based on the company employing at least 2,500 workers, including $229 million in public infrastructure projects using Tax Increment Financing funds. Local development is already underway, with 1,100 housing units being built in De Soto to accommodate the workforce.

Theo Stavropoulos, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Commerce, highlighted the early economic benefits: ""Local businesses are seeing the influx of new customers, driving local sales tax revenues up and reducing the local property tax mill levy,"" as reported by the Kansas Reflector.

Tesla relationship and market outlook

Panasonic's Kansas facility continues the company's long-standing relationship with Tesla. The battery maker has supplied approximately 19 billion cells as of March 2025, with its Nevada factory delivering more than 11 billion cells to date. These batteries have powered approximately 3.7 million EVs without causing any vehicle recalls, setting industry standards for safety and reliability.

While the current market slowdown has prompted production adjustments, industry analysts note that the long-term outlook for EV adoption remains positive, albeit with revised expectations. The production delay appears to be a strategic response to current market conditions rather than a fundamental shift in Panasonic's commitment to EV battery manufacturing.

Building for the future

Despite the immediate challenges, Panasonic is positioning the Kansas facility as a foundation for long-term growth in the US EV market. The company is collaborating with institutions like the University of Kansas to develop industry-academia partnerships focused on technological advancement and specialized talent development.

These partnerships aim to strengthen the domestic supply chain for electric vehicles while enhancing Panasonic's competitiveness in North American battery manufacturing. As the EV market continues to evolve amid changing policies and consumer preferences, Panasonic's significant investment in U.S. manufacturing capacity demonstrates a long-term commitment to the electrification of transportation, even as it navigates short-term market fluctuations.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt92d85e5d220a60dd/687517752a06940864b2a79c/Panasonic-KN-Production_lines_2.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-14 14:28:03.681331

BWTs consist of a cylinder built of resin-reinforced carbon fiber or glass fiber that is anchored to the ground by a rod. Traditional wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the moving blades into electricity. In comparison, BWTs generate power by vortex-induced vibration – a process where the cylinder oscillates when the wind hits it and the movement of the cylinder generates mechanical energy that is then transformed into electric energy by a generator.

The team at the University of Glasgow discovered an optimal design for BWTs where power generation is maximized against structural strength. After assessing a variety of structures, the engineers determined the ideal BWT consisted of an 80cm mast which is 65cm in diameter. To date, prototypes delivered a maximum of 100 watts of power and the simulation of the ideal BWT delivered a maximum of 460 watts of power. Once scaled up to utility grade systems, the BWTs could generate 1 kilowatt or more, making them a practical alternative for renewable energy systems.",https://acmanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/federico-respini-sYffw0LNr7s-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:32:24.889298

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/07/2025-06-19T144611Z_1585215596_RC2H5FA4PVJW_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-DAILYLIFE-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:34:50.758130

Sawtooth Energy and Development, an independently owned energy developer in Idaho, plans to build a 462-MW nuclear power plant in southern Idaho, according to local news reports and a draft environmental impact statement.

The plant would take shape on public land previously earmarked for LS Power’s 1-GW Lava Ridge wind farm and use an Idaho Power substation that would have connected its turbines to the Western U.S. grid. President Trump halted Lava Ridge on his first day in office.

Dan Adamson, project manager for Sawtooth, told Idaho News 6 that LS Power’s predevelopment work, President Trump’s recent nuclear executive orders and the federal budget bill Trump signed on July 4 could reduce the project’s development timeline from five years to about two years.

Dive Insight:

Midpoint Small Modular Reactor Project #1 would use six 77-MW NuScale VOYGR modules to produce an electric output of 462 MW, according to the draft EIS dated July 31, 2025, and posted on Sawtooth’s website.

The plant would occupy a 320-acre Bureau of Land Management site about 15 miles northeast of Jerome, Idaho, near Idaho Power’s Midpoint substation, the EIS says. The substation connects transmission lines running east-west through Idaho and southwest into Nevada.

Sawtooth has not yet filed an interconnection request with Idaho Power and the utility is not directly involved in the project, an Idaho Power spokesperson told local newspaper the Times-News earlier this week. Adamson told the outlet that Sawtooth is working on the interconnection request and that he expects the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to approve the project’s environmental study “very, very soon.”

Before construction can begin, the project also needs a construction permit or combined operating license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. NRC’s website shows no active applications for the site.

NuScale says it has designated ENTRA1 Energy as its “exclusive global partner for the commercialization, distribution and deployment of our SMR technology.” Under the arrangement, ENTRA1 “develops, finances, owns and operates” plants powered by NuScale modules.

In a written statement Wednesday, a NuScale representative distanced the company from Sawtooth.

“Currently, we are not engaged with Sawtooth Energy and Development Corp., nor have we authorized them to make any public statements regarding NuScale Power,” the statement read. “NuScale remains committed to working with our exclusive partner, ENTRA1, to commercialize, deploy, and distribute the only NRC-approved SMR technology.”

In a Friday email, Adamson said that Sawtooth had not engaged with ENTRA1. However, the company has “talked with NuScale and [we] like their equipment and design, but [has] no written deal as of yet.”

Sawtooth expects to deliver its draft environmental impact statement to the NRC by late August and begin the NRC licensing process sometime after that, he added.

In May, NRC approved NuScale’s updated design for the US460 plant, the same six-module configuration Sawtooth says it will build. That “standard design certification” could accelerate the review process once an application is filed.

Should it reach operation, Midpoint would become the first commercial U.S. power plant using NuScale’s pressurized water reactor technology. The company previously had an agreement with a coalition of Western utilities to deploy a 462-MW power plant at Idaho National Laboratory, but that project fell apart in late 2023 amid rising costs and flagging subscriptions.

More recently, NuScale executives have said they are engaging with hyperscale data center companies and other power-hungry customers. But committed offtake agreements with utility or industrial customers have proven elusive.

NuScale has at least 12 modules in production with Doosan, its South Korea-based manufacturing partner, CEO John Hopkins said on its most recent investor call.

The automaker will convert part of its Spring Hill, Tennessee, manufacturing plant to incorporate LFP battery assembly.

The next-generation Chevy Bolt EV and one trim of the Silverado EV will be powered by LFP batteries.

General Motors' electric vehicle plans are already paying dividends. With a dozen models across multiple segments, the automaker is breaking sales records and chipping away at Tesla’s market share. And despite the expiration of federal tax credits and a generally hostile regulatory environment for EVs, GM isn’t letting off the throttle.

GM said on Monday that it will upgrade its Spring Hill, Tennessee, factory to incorporate the local production of low-cost lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for its EVs. The Spring Hill battery factory is owned by Ultium Cells, a joint venture between GM and Korean battery giant LG Energy Solution, which is also the main battery supplier for several major car companies in the U.S., including Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and Rivian, among others.

Across the industry, lower-cost LFP batteries are seen as key to more affordable EV options. The largest single cost on any EV is its battery, and lowering those costs should bring car prices down as well.

LFP is a low-cost alternative to nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells, which are both expensive and leave a considerable environmental impact in their production. While they generally offer lower energy density, LFP cells are safer, more durable and increasingly competitive on range, especially in China, where they now power over 80% of the country’s EVs.

GM has confirmed that both the Chevy Silverado EV and the next-generation Chevy Bolt EV will use LFP batteries. However, it didn’t comment on whether the packs for those vehicles will be produced at Spring Hill. The new Bolt EV is expected to enter production later this year and reach customers in early 2026—about two years before local LFP production begins. GM also said the LFP-powered Silverado EV will offer around 350 miles of range and cut $6,000 in costs.

The conversion of the battery assembly lines will begin by the end of this year and production will start by the end of 2027. GM is targeting “significant cost savings” on the pack level with LFP batteries compared to today’s lithium-ion packs with high-nickel chemistries.

Though LFP cells were originally developed in the U.S. at the University of Texas at Austin, they were commercialized and scaled rapidly in China. Chinese battery makers such as BYD and CATL have since led in refining and advancing the technology. Korean firms like LGES were comparatively slower to adopt LFP but are now trying to catch up.

The chemistry is also undergoing a renaissance in the U.S. Ford plans to produce LFP cells at its BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, for future low-cost EVs and Tesla recently expanded its LFP facility in Sparks, Nevada, for energy storage applications.

For now, the GM-LGES joint venture is the largest producer of battery cells in North America, outpacing even Tesla. GM is also investing in next-generation chemistries, including lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) batteries for full-size trucks and SUVs, which are expected to enter production by early 2028. The automaker is also working on silicon anodes and exploring solid-state technologies in its R&D labs.

It’s US$2 a watt in Australia.” The model is designed to demonstrate how, even without subsidies, residential solar can be scaled affordably and profitably through operational and permitting reform.
“At that level, you can offer a customer a 30% savings without any tax credit or net metering.
And really importantly… you no longer have this sword hanging over you from ITC risk or net metering risk.”","The US residential solar market has been struggling in recent years, with changes to California’s net metering programme driving a sharp decline in 2024.

The sector is now under even greater pressure after Donald Trump’s tax reconciliation bill, signed into law earlier this month, scrapped the 30% investment tax credit for rooftop systems.

OpenSolar CEO and co-founder Andrew Birch said: “Everyone’s asking what happens when the ITC goes away. The better question is: what if we can stop relying on it?”

Speaking to PV Tech, Birch said the “fundamental truth misunderstood by everyone in the market” is that solar costs twice as much in the US as it does everywhere else in the world.

“With a battery, you’re looking at US$5 a watt for a residential solar system [in the US]; in the UK, you pay half that.

“If I decide to go solar with a UK installer today, I could get one installed on Friday, and the cost would be US$14-15,000 equivalent. If I do that in the US, I will go through somewhere between a two-to-six-month process of permitting, with multiple site visits, full documentation, paperwork… There are 16,000 jurisdictions in the US, each has its own planning process, so you have this incredibly laborious and expensive process to install the solar. The net result is US$5 a watt. It’s US$2 a watt in Australia.”

The model is designed to demonstrate how, even without subsidies, residential solar can be scaled affordably and profitably through operational and permitting reform.

The model compares US solar installation costs to those in other global markets, such as Australia, breaking down line by line where US installers are overspending and how those costs can be cut.

It draws on live installer cost data from the US and Australia and international best practices from OpenSolar’s installer network, simulating how digitising design, sales and project management via OpenSolar and automating permitting through the SolarAPP+ platform can drive down costs and improve margins.

Birch said the opportunity was to use best practice from overseas to automate permitting and get costs down to around the US$2.50/watt mark. “At that level, you can offer a customer a 30% savings without any tax credit or net metering.

While the OBBBA preserves the availability of certain clean energy incentives, it also accelerates the phaseout of others; introduces new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions on project ownership, supply chains and tax credit buyers; and codifies long-term policy shifts that will impact renewable energy developers, tax equity investors, tax credit purchasers, lenders and manufacturers.

Below is a summary of the key energy provisions enacted under the OBBBA.

Phaseout of Clean Electricity Tax Credits and Placed-in-Service Deadline for Wind and Solar Projects (Sections 45Y and 48E)

One-Year Safe Harbor: Wind and solar projects that begin construction within 12 months of the OBBBA’s enactment can still qualify for the full technology-neutral clean electricity Production Tax Credit under Section 45Y (CEPTC) and the Investment Tax Credit under Section 48E (CEITC) with no hard placed-in-service deadline. However, any projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025, will still be subject to the FEOC limitations discussed below.

Placed-in-Service Deadline for Wind and Solar Projects: For any wind and solar projects that fall outside of the one-year safe harbor discussed above, the OBBBA shortens the timeline for these projects to qualify for the CEPTC and the CEITC, requiring them to be placed in service by December 31, 2027, in order to qualify for the credits.

Other Technologies Unaffected: Clean electricity projects qualifying for the CEITC using nuclear, hydropower, geothermal or energy storage technologies are not subject to a hard placed-in-service deadline and remain eligible for the full credit value through 2033, with a gradual phasedown in 2034 through 2035. This phasedown is based on the date construction begins, not when the facility is placed in service, which should provide developers with more flexibility with construction timelines.

Fuel Cells: The OBBBA specifically adds fuel cells (as defined in Section 48(c)(1)), which also includes linear generators, as a new identified category of CEITC-eligible technology. Since fuel cells are considered combustion and gasification technology under the CEITC rules, this allows these projects to qualify for the CEITC without needing to meet the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions requirements. It also provides for a simple flat 30% CEITC without allowing any credit adders.

Domestic Content Adder Fix: The OBBBA also fixes an apparent drafting error made in the IRA that would have increased the qualification threshold up to 55% over time for CEPTC projects but kept the CEITC threshold static at 40%. Under the OBBBA, CEITC projects that began construction prior to June 16, 2025, can still rely on a 40% threshold, but projects that begin construction after that date in 2025 and seek to claim a domestic content adder must meet a domestic content threshold of 45%. After 2025, the threshold is subject to annual increases that match the CEPTC thresholds.

Foreign Entity of Concern Restrictions on Credit Eligibility

The OBBBA imposes new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions in order for projects to qualify for the clean energy tax credits. In general, no CEPTC or CEITC is allowed if a project is owned or influenced by a Prohibited Foreign Entity of Concern (PFE) or if it relies on significant inputs from such entities. These rules are modeled after the CHIPS Act FEOC standards and operate in two main categories: (1) ownership/control by a PFE and (2) “material assistance” from a PFE.

Ownership or Control by a PFE: OBBBA disqualifies many of the tax credits if a project is owned or controlled (directly or indirectly) by a PFE. In statutory terms, a PFE includes any Specified Foreign Entity (SFE) or Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE).

SFE: This category covers “foreign entities of concern” as defined in CHIPS Act/NDAA 2021 and similar lists. SFEs include entities on U.S. sanctions or blocked-persons lists (e.g., terrorist organizations, OFAC-designated nationals) and certain Chinese military or forced-labor lists. They also include any entity owned or controlled by, or organized in, a “covered” foreign nation (China, Iran, North Korea, Russia) or by their governments or citizens. For example, a battery manufacturer owned by the Chinese government or individual would be classified as an SFE in this category.

FIE: An FIE is typically a U.S. or noncovered entity that a foreign concern effectively controls. Ownership/control thresholds are used, and an entity becomes an FIE if a single SFE owns at least 25%, multiple SFEs own at least 40% combined, or SFEs hold at least 15% of the entity’s debt. Contractual controls are also taken into account under this category; if in the prior year the entity made a payment to an SFE under an arrangement giving that SFE “effective control” over the project (or over production of key components), the entity is treated as FIE. “Effective control” for this purpose means the SFE has specific authority over project decisions beyond normal commercial rights, such as controlling output, operations, key sourcing or long-term technology licenses/royalties. In short, even indirect foreign influence through governance, financing or contracts can taint an entity as an FIE. Up-the-chain ownership is also scrutinized, and this characterization can flow through parent companies if the threshold tests above are met.

A project owner that is a PFE cannot claim the CEPTC, CEITC, the Section 45X manufacturing credit or other covered credits for any tax year in which it meets those definitions. This PFOC ownership/control ban takes effect for taxable years after enactment (with a brief grace period for FIE status under certain credits).

“Material Assistance” From a PFE: The second category of FEOC restrictions includes the “material assistance” rule, which denies credits if a project receives significant components, materials or other assistance from SFEs. CEITCs, CEPTCs and other applicable provisions are disallowed if the project or facility receives “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity. “Material assistance” is defined using quantitative thresholds based on cost inputs and sourcing, with regulations to be issued by Treasury. The FEOC material assistance limitations apply when the ratio of a project’s costs paid to FEOCs divided by the project’s total costs exceeds a designated percentage. The formula rules are modeled after domestic content provisions and include anti-circumvention measures to prevent avoidance through indirect sourcing or restructuring.

Qualified Facilities (CEPTC/CEITC Projects): Must have at least 40% non-FEOC content for projects that begin construction in 2026, rising to 60% for projects starting after 2029.

Energy Storage Technologies: Start at 55% non-FEOC content for projects that begin construction in 2026, rising to 75% for projects beginning of construction after 2029.

Specific Components and Critical Minerals: Specific thresholds apply to certain components sold in a given year. Solar modules must be at least 50% non-FEOC beginning in 2026, rising to 85% by 2030. Inverters, battery components and critical minerals have their own threshold schedules.

If a project or product’s non-FEOC cost ratio falls below the threshold, it is deemed to have received “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity and is ineligible for the credit. Notably, this material-sourcing rule applies to facilities beginning construction after 2025 (earlier projects are safe-harbored).

CEITC Recapture Provisions for FEOC Noncompliance: In addition to the above restrictions, OBBBA added new recapture rules for CEITCs to claw back credits if a project later becomes noncompliant with the FEOC conditions. In particular, if a facility that claimed the CEITC subsequently comes under foreign entity control or sourcing influence, prior credits may be partly or fully recaptured. If a project is transferred or sold in a transaction that results in a PFE becoming an owner, that change in ownership would presumably disqualify the credits and require recapture of the CEITC claimed.

Transferability of Tax Credits Preserved (Section 6418)

The OBBBA retains transferability of clean energy tax credits added by the IRA under Section 6418. As enacted, Section 6418 allows eligible entities to elect to transfer all or a portion of certain energy tax credits to unrelated parties in a sale transaction. The intent behind the provision was to create liquidity and expanded access to tax equity financing for clean energy projects. Under the OBBBA, eligible credits, including the CEPTC, CEITC, PTC, ITC and other IRA-enacted credits, may continue to be transferred to unrelated parties in exchange for cash. The OBBBA also extends transferability to the small agri-biodiesel producer credit under Section 40A(b)(4), which may now be transferred for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2027.

New FEOC Restriction: Transferees (tax credit buyers) are prohibited from claiming any transferred credits if they themselves are PFEs or receive “material assistance” from such entities in connection with the credit-generating activity.

Leasing and Structuring Restrictions for Residential Wind and Solar Water Heating Property

The OBBBA imposes a new restriction on CEPTC and CEITC eligibility for residential wind and solar water heating projects that are financed through leasing arrangements in the residential sector for any taxable year beginning after enactment. In practical terms, this means no federal credit can be claimed for a system that is owned by a company and leased to a homeowner or business user, a structure that often allows the lessor company to claim or monetize the CEITC while providing the customer the benefits of the offtake from a system. Earlier drafts of the OBBBA included a broader leasing restriction that also applied to residential rooftop solar systems, but the final version of the bill only focuses the leasing restriction on solar water heating property or small wind energy property.

This new leasing restriction likely only applies to on-site residential energy property and therefore the restriction would not apply to commercial-scale leasing, community solar models or utility-scale projects.

Treatment of Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Fuels and Hydrogen Credits

The OBBBA modifies the scope and timeline of several other IRA energy tax credits:

Section 45X — Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit: The Section 45X Credit remains available for eligible components as defined under the IRA. Wind components (e.g., turbine blades, towers, nacelles) are removed from the list of eligible components after December 31, 2027. Critical minerals remain eligible, but gradually phaseout starting in 2031 through 2032. Starting after December 31, 2026, eligible components must have been integrated into another eligible component within the same facility, then be sold to an unrelated person and have more than 65% of total direct domestic costs to be eligible for the credit. The OBBBA creates a new category of eligible critical minerals for “metallurgical coal” and, unlike for other eligible critical minerals, specifically allows for metallurgical coal to be produced outside of the United States to qualify for the credit. The OBBBA also now requires battery modules to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment,” to be eligible for the credit.

Section 45Z — Clean Fuel Production Credit: The Section 45Z Credit is extended through December 31, 2029 (two-year extension beyond the IRA sunset). Credit rates will remain based on life-cycle emissions and carbon intensity thresholds.

Section 45V — Clean Hydrogen Production Credit: The Section 45V Credit will still be available to facilities that begin construction by December 31, 2027. The OBBBA maintains the same four-tiered emissions-based rate structure originally enacted under the IRA.

Section 45Q — Carbon Capture Credit: The Section 45Q Credit retains its original sunset date as provided for in the IRA.

Section 45U — Nuclear Credit: The Section 45U Credit, the production tax credit for nuclear facilities, retains its original sunset date as provided for in the IRA, but will become subject to the FEOC ownership restrictions discussed above.

Executive Order on Beginning of Construction

On July 7, President Trump issued an executive order titled “Ending Market-Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources,” directing federal agencies to enforce stricter standards for clean energy tax credits under the OBBBA. The executive order instructs the Treasury to issue new or revised guidance within 45 days (by August 18, 2025) to clarify the “beginning-of-construction” standard under CEPTC and CEITC. The executive order states that this guidance must prevent artificial acceleration of construction start dates by requiring that a “substantial portion” of a wind or solar facility has actually been built before safe harbor provisions can be invoked.

The Treasury is also tasked with promptly implementing the enhanced FEOC restrictions established by the OBBBA to ensure FEOC ownership/control and material assistance restrictions are implemented within the compliance timeframe.

Key Takeaways

The OBBBA preserves a significant portion of the IRA’s clean energy tax architecture but imposes key limitations and new diligence obligations for developers, investors, lenders and credit buyers.

Advanced reactors promise greater safety, quicker deployment and less cost than traditional nuclear generation. But skeptics warn that the technology remains largely unproven in the Western world and that early deployments may cost significantly more than advertised.

More recently, the NRC has accelerated reactor construction permit reviews, allowed approved reactor designs to remain valid longer and eased restrictions on certain factory-built reactors. More NRC reforms are on the way.

Advanced nuclear energy is on the upswing thanks also to supportive state policy, expected load growth, technology companies’ interest in “clean firm” power and federal tax incentives that largely survived GOP budget negotiations, ClearView Energy Partners said in a July 3 research note.

These tailwinds have many utility leaders planning for a future generating mix that includes new nuclear. For those that aren’t, now is the time to get up to speed.

Defining “advanced nuclear”

Despite being “as different from one another as gouda and gorgonzola,” all advanced reactors have simpler and less failure-prone safety systems than those securing the vast majority of currently operating reactors, according to the Nuclear Innovation Alliance, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group that put out a comprehensive primer on advanced nuclear technologies last year. Most of these systems are at least partially passive, meaning they don’t require human intervention to activate.

The most expansive definition of advanced nuclear encompasses large light-water reactors like the two 1,117-MW AP1000s now in operation at Georgia Power’s Vogtle power plant — whose final price tag of about $32 billion more than doubled the $14 billion preconstruction estimate — as well as tiny microreactors like the 1-MW molten salt design under construction at Abilene Christian University. In between are modular reactors — known as micro- or small modular reactors, depending on their output — that can be partly or even largely built in a factory and then transported to the generating site.

Experts say smaller reactor designs may prove faster and cheaper to deploy than larger ones, advanced or otherwise. The U.S. Department of Energy in September estimated the total project cost for a first-of-its-kind small modular reactor at $4 billion, or one-third the expense of a larger reactor. A British study released in 2018 found that full modularization could reduce capital costs by more than 40%, excluding interest charges.

But large advanced reactors may always be more cost-effective for bulk electricity generation, DOE says. The department pegs costs for a first-of-a-kind large light-water reactor at about $8,500/kW, compared with about $13,000/kW for an early SMR, and flags large reactor build costs as low as $2,300/kW in South Korea after decades of process improvement there.

What’s next for advanced nuclear

Cost concerns led to the cancellation in late 2023 of NuScale’s 462-MW Carbon Free Power Project, which until this May was the United States’ only commercial SMR project for a utility offtaker.

The project’s cancellation was a big setback for the nearly 20-year-old Oregon company and advanced nuclear more broadly.

Though NuScale remains a subcontractor on a power plant project in Romania and says it’s close to signing offtake agreements with non-utility customers in the United States.

It was also a teaching moment for the industry, said Judi Greenwald, executive director of the Nuclear Innovation Alliance.

“[NuScale] put all their eggs in one basket [and] that one entity wasn’t enough of a business case,” she said, referring to the coalition of Western municipal utilities that would have purchased power from the project.

Likewise, NuScale’s often halting regulatory engagement with the NRC — the company got approval for a 50-MW module in 2020, then returned for the 77-MW module the NRC greenlighted in May — provided a model for future nuclear technology companies to engage and made the agency itself more efficient, Greenwald said.

“NuScale paved the way for a lot of other people,” she said. “They spent a lot of time with NRC, some of it not as fruitful as we would have liked, and a lot of others are going to get the benefit.”

Those lessons and landmark pro-nuclear laws passed in 2019 and 2024 have pushed the NRC to speed up its reactor design, construction permit and operating license application reviews; develop a lighter-touch framework for microreactor licensing; and establish a new “risk-informed, technology-inclusive” licensing pathway for advanced reactors.

The upshot could be faster, more efficient approvals for all sorts of advanced nuclear technologies, particularly microreactors, said James Richards, manager of NIA’s economics and project development program.

“Microreactor developers are very much anticipating going faster,” he said. “The regulatory environment has changed and is changing.”

The nuclear technology companies that came up behind NuScale have diverse business and development models, Greenwald and Richards said.

Kairos Power, Greenwald said, follows an “innovation model” that relies on low-power test reactors to perfect their technology and minimize future licensing challenges on the way to commercialization.

GE Hitachi is following a more direct route to commercialization by partnering with big, innovative utilities willing to take risks on a first-of-its-kind project.

Holtec International plans to develop SMRs on existing nuclear power plant sites with spare interconnection capacity, beginning with the soon-to-be-restarted, 800-MW Palisades generating station in southwestern Michigan.

X-energy’s first commercial project will supply process heat and electricity at a Dow petrochemical complex in Texas, replacing the facility’s aging, fossil-fired cogeneration plant. Along with TerraPower, X-energy has significant support from the DOE Office of Clean Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

And Last Energy is pursuing front-of-the-meter and behind-the-meter arrangements with data centers and other large power consumers interested in its 20-MWe modules.

“If you can cut through the noise, there is real stuff happening in the industry right now — shovels in the ground,” Richards said. “We haven’t seen this since the 1980s, and we’re seeing it with new and different designs”

Advanced nuclear reactor types

All commercial reactors operating in the U.S. today use steam or superhot pressurized water to generate electricity and cool cores powered by low-enriched uranium.

Some advanced reactor designs envision doing the same, but not all. A fair number use liquid metal, molten salt or high-temperature gas for cooling and heat transfer. Many of these more novel designs — including those from Kairos Power, TerraPower and X-energy — will use more potent high-assay, low-enriched uranium, which allows for more efficient reactions in compact reactors with longer refueling cycles.

HALEU-powered non-water reactors can reach higher outlet temperatures than water-cooled reactors, making them suitable not just for electricity generation but for industrial heat production as well, according to an Information Technology & Innovation Foundation paper published earlier this year.

Five varieties of advanced reactor stand out right now. For each, Utility Dive has highlighted a project or developer reasonably far along in the demonstration process as an example.

Pressurized water reactor (PWR)

Potential applications*: Power generation, lower-grade industrial heat (desalination, pulp and paper, some petrochemical applications)

Example project: AP-1000s at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, Georgia Power — Waynesboro, Georgia

Pressurized water reactors have powered conventional nuclear plants for decades. The reactor core heats a pressurized water loop that generates steam in a secondary, lower-pressure loop that powers a turbine generator.

PWR technology factors into several advanced nuclear designs, including NuScale’s US460, Holtec International’s SMR-300, Last Energy’s PWR-20 and Westinghouse’s AP1000 and AP300 SMR.

Boiling water reactor (BWR)

Potential applications*: Power generation, lower-grade industrial heat

Example project: BWRX-300 at Clinch River Nuclear Site, Tennessee Valley Authority — Clinch River, Tennessee

The boiling water reactor is the other mainstay of the U.S. conventional nuclear fleet. The reactor core heats and partially boils pure water, which — after some twists and turns — produces pure steam to power the main generator.

The technology isn’t as popular with SMR developers, but there is one standout: GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, which has made significant progress toward commercialization. One is already under construction at Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington nuclear plant and could come online there by 2029.

Stateside, Tennessee Valley Authority in May became the first U.S. utility to submit an SMR construction permit for a planned BWRX-300 plant that could power up in the early 2030s.

Molten salt reactor (MSR)

Potential applications*: Power generation, high-quality industrial heat (hydrogen production, most petrochemical processes, direct steelmaking)

Example project: Hermes 1 and 2, Kairos Power — Oak Ridge, Tennessee

Molten salt reactors use molten salt as a coolant only or as a dual fuel and coolant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. In either case, the salt can absorb far more heat than water, allowing the reactors to operate at temperatures high enough to power hard to abate industrial processes like production of plastic precursors.

Some advanced nuclear plant designs, including the next on our list, also use molten salt as an energy storage medium that operates separately from the reactor and generator.

Some nuclear experts see molten salt reactors as an “over the horizon” technology that will mature after BWRs, PWRs and liquid metal reactors, but Kairos Power appears to be making progress toward commercialization. It’s building the first of two test reactors in Tennessee, targeting commissioning in 2027, and has agreed to supply 500 MW of power to Google by the mid-2030s.

Liquid metal reactor (LMR)

Potential applications*: Power generation, medium-grade industrial heat (tar sands and shale oil production, petroleum refining)

Example project: Natrium at Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1, TerraPower — Kemmerer, Wyoming

Liquid metal reactors use molten metal, often pure sodium, to cool the core and transfer heat to an electric generator, energy storage medium and/or facilities running medium-temperature industrial or resource extraction processes.

Neutrons move much faster through metal-cooled cores than through water-cooled cores, enabling fast reactor designs that can recycle nuclear fuel and potentially reduce nuclear waste.

Oklo and TerraPower are both working to commercialize sodium-cooled fast reactors. TerraPower broke ground last year at the Wyoming site of its 345-MW Natrium commercial demonstration reactor, which is in line to get its construction permit later this year and could power up by 2030. Thanks to a molten salt energy storage reservoir, that facility will have load-following capabilities to complement the wind-heavy Wyoming grid.

High-temperature gas reactor (HTGR)

Potential applications*: Power generation, high-quality industrial heat

Example project: Xe100s at Long Mott Generating Station, Dow & X-energy — Seadrift, Texas

High-temperature gas reactors use helium or another stable gas to cool their cores and transfer heat for electricity production or direct industrial use. They achieve very high outlet temperatures with great efficiency, making them ideal for heavy industries like petrochemicals and steelmaking.

The best-known U.S. HGTR is X-energy’s Xe-100, which is the subject of an active construction permit application and could come online early next decade at Dow’s Seadrift facility.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fRi82UUGjZNhL9z-Gyr8boBMXOn_P2mMfxTVTso-Hik/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9XQ0tfNDE2M19uQXh0TkNwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-14 11:19:51.064308

The APTA Sustainability Commitment program is a voluntary initiative where public transit agencies and businesses pledge to implement practices that continuously advance environmental, social, and economic sustainability goals. Based on measurable achievements, organizations receive recognition at Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze levels. Since its inception in 2009, 140 public transit agencies and businesses have signed on, with 51 signatories having reached higher-level recognition.

“APTA is proud to honor DART and Pierce Transit for their dedication to building a more sustainable future,” said APTA President and CEO Paul P. Skoutelas. “DART’s Gold recognition and Pierce Transit’s Silver recognition reflect not only strong leadership but also measurable progress in reducing environmental impact and enhancing quality of life for the communities they serve. Their accomplishments help set the standard for what’s possible in sustainable public transportation.”

Gold Level – Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART)

Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) is advancing sustainability through strategic infrastructure upgrades and a long-standing commitment to clean energy. In 2021, DART completed an Investment Grade Audit (IGA) Report that laid the foundation for a more energy-efficient and environmentally responsible public transit system. Guided by the IGA, DART implemented comprehensive energy-saving measures, including the installation of LED lighting across all buildings, rail station facilities, and parking areas. These upgrades were further enhanced with occupancy sensors and motion detectors, significantly reducing energy use—by as much as 40 percent in parking lots and garages.

In 2022, DART took a major step toward climate responsibility by securing a new electricity contract sourced entirely from renewable energy. Within two years, DART transitioned to 100 percent renewable electricity for all facilities and light rail operations, reinforcing its leadership in sustainable public transit.

DART’s environmental commitment extends to its bus fleet, which has operated on compressed renewable natural gas (CNG-RNG) for nearly a decade. By using 100 percent renewable CNG, DART buses produce 75 percent fewer emissions than gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, contributing to cleaner air and a reduced carbon footprint across the North Texas region.

Silver Level – Pierce Transit

Since piloting its first compressed natural gas (CNG) buses in 1986, Pierce Transit has kept sustainability at the forefront of how it serves and engages with its community. The agency has reduced its total emissions by 19 percent (adjusted for service levels) since 2017. In 2018, Pierce Transit’s CEO issued Executive Order No. 1, committing to the use of green technologies and strategies. The agency’s 2024–2028 Strategic Plan prioritizes sustainability across its finances, infrastructure, and environmental practices.

In 2022, Pierce Transit signed on to the FTA’s Sustainable Transit for a Healthy Planet Challenge and has since developed a Zero Emission Bus Transition Strategy and Green Fleet Strategic Objective to achieve 100 percent electrification of its revenue fleet by 2042. The agency’s Zero Emissions Coordinator collaborates with Maintenance, Finance, and Operations departments to explore new technologies and reduce the agency’s carbon footprint—efforts that include transitioning its diesel fleet to 100 percent renewable R99 diesel and its CNG fleet to RNG in 2023.

Pierce Transit’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond fleet operations. Initiatives include recycling fluids and materials, coordinating employee transportation benefit programs with local businesses, opening a new fueling and bus wash facility that reduces wastewater by 90 percent, and installing energy-efficient lighting at its base and regional transit hubs.

That’s when the Trump administration abruptly canceled $87.9 million in federal grants awarded to Michigan nonprofits, county governments and planning commissions to help them respond to a changing climate. Administration officials justified the cuts by saying the grant programs no longer aligned with the US Environmental Protection Agency’s priorities.

“We were off to a great start,” said Briana DuBose, the executive director of EcoWorks, a Detroit-based nonprofit that was awarded $20 million in December. “But, unfortunately, due to the terminations, we’re in a holding pattern.”

EcoWorks had planned to transform 15 houses of worship into what are called “community resilience hubs” — spaces where residents could access medical services, apply for relief or simply cool down during floods, heat waves or power outages.

Similar plans for Benton Harbor, Kalamazoo, and the 12 federally recognized Native American tribes in the state have been stalled for now. A fifth grant for the Midwest Tribal Energy Resources Association to improve energy efficiency in tribal homes — worth $20 million — was also canceled.

Those resilience hubs, often located in existing soup kitchens, churches or civic centers, are designed to help communities deal with climate threats as the world struggles to curb greenhouse gas emissions. First piloted in Baltimore, the model has since spread to cities across the country, including Detroit and Ann Arbor.

During a recent heat wave in Michigan, for example, about a dozen existing resilience hubs in Detroit provided shelter to residents seeking relief from high temperatures.

But plans to create new hubs in the city and elsewhere have stalled in the wake of the grant cancellations. While some nonprofits rely more heavily on philanthropic dollars and have been able to continue their work, others say they’re unable to move forward without outside support.

So long as that grant money stays frozen, “we probably won’t see the development of many community resilience hubs,” said Douglas Jester, a managing partner at the pro-renewable consulting firm 5 Lakes Energy.

What is a resilience hub?

Resilience hubs are community facilities that provide vital resources — from food and water to medical supplies and backup power — before, during and after disasters. They’re typically located in underserved neighborhoods where residents are disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In Detroit, for instance, power outages have historically hit low-income and minority communities hardest.

In 2021, after extreme flooding overwhelmed parts of Detroit, Meghan Richards turned to the Eastside Community Network for help.

The network “paid for basement muck-out, helped people out with their FEMA applications and gave out supplies,” said Richards, who is now the organization’s assistant director of climate equity and coordinates the Resilient Eastside Initiative.

She emphasized that the location and familiarity of the hub — situated near her home and run by neighbors — played a big role in encouraging her and other residents to access help through the network.

“You can build the newest, most up-to-date buildings, but if people don’t know them, they’re not going,” Richards said.

Since 2023, the Eastside Community Network, in partnership with the City of Detroit, has established a dozen resilience hubs across east Detroit. Most of the funding came from the Kresge Foundation, rather than federal grants, Richards noted.

Grant terminations

EcoWorks, alongside the nonprofits Solar Faithful and Interfaith Solar & Light, announced a similar plan to convert 15 soup kitchens, churches and mosques into resilience hubs using a $20 million Community Change Grant awarded by the EPA.

But in May, the Trump administration suddenly rescinded that award, along with other grants meant to benefit historically underserved communities — $2.7 billion nationwide — saying they no longer aligned with the agency’s values.

Democratic lawmakers criticized the move as illegal, arguing the grants were made using funds that Congress mandated be distributed to disadvantaged communities under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

An agency spokesperson rejected that argument, characterizing the grants as an example of the previous administration forcing “their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing the EPA’s core mission.

“The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” the spokesperson continued.

Among the canceled grants was $20 million intended to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative.

“It’s a pretty big blow to this community to lose that funding,” said Marcy Hamilton, a senior planner at the Southwest Michigan Planning Commission, which had received the grant.

Two of the five Michigan grant recipients, the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan and Kalamazoo County, filed a class action lawsuit against the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin, last month, demanding the agency reinstate all the grant awards. The planning commission joined the suit as a class action member, Hamilton said.

Kalamazoo County had planned to use their $18.9 million award to develop four neighborhood centers that could be used as emergency shelters during extreme weather and improve the energy efficiency of 300 homes around the city of Kalamazoo. The Inter-Tribal Council had planned similar upgrades to tribal homes and to make 12 government facilities into resilience hubs.

Lawyers for the county and council claim the terminations have harmed and will continue to harm communities that face the greatest impacts from “environmental degradation and have historically had little voice in the decision-making process that affect them,” according to court filings.

On July 9, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, joined by 18 states and the District of Columbia, filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs. The filing argues that canceling congressionally mandated grants violates the constitutional separation of powers.

Search for new funding

While the lawsuit proceeds, Hamilton said the planning commission is pursuing alternative funding sources, such as private philanthropy or money from state-run programs like MI Solar for All, which installs solar panels on buildings and has not been affected by the cancellations.

“But it’s nothing that’ll be as quick or transformational” as the now-rescinded EPA grant, Hamilton said.

Meanwhile, a neighborhood group in South Dearborn is looking to the Legislature for support. State Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, has requested $8 million in the state budget to help fund the construction of a resilience hub equipped with an air-filtration system, a solar array that can store power for 72 hours and communications equipment that works during outages.

“The unfortunate truth is that there’s a disproportionate impact on my constituents who live in one of the most polluted ZIP codes in the state,” Farhat wrote in a text message. “On top of facing increased health and environmental risks, many of them also struggle to afford the cost of high utilities and repairs that result from climate change.”

Sam Luqman, a board member of Concerned Residents for South Dearborn, said the state funding is critical. Given the federal setbacks, she’s hoping Farhat can deliver.

Without it, she said, “our community will continue to suffer — and we suffer at disproportionate rates compared to other communities.”

DuBose, of EcoWorks, said that, even if the lawsuit fails, there could still be ways for churches and community centers to implement smaller-scale resilient upgrades, like installing solar panels or backup generators.

Jacqueline Moore, the founder and CEO of SDM2 Project Education — one of the planned beneficiaries from the EcoWorks grant — echoed that sentiment, saying “it does not stop us from getting the job done.”",https://themanchestermirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ECNTour-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:20:27.330200

Many raised concerns about the end of the tax credit and emphasized over the last month that they are counting on this project’s economic boost.
Even with the production tax credits surviving threatened cuts, Ford is still planning on EV battery production at a time when the market is volatile and rapidly changing.","Ford Motor Co.’s massive electric vehicle battery factory under construction in Marshall will be eligible for federal tax credits after revisions to President Donald Trump’s so-called $3.4 trillion “big, beautiful bill.”

The change follows a warning from the automaker’s executive chair Bill Ford Jr. in May, when he told Michigan business leaders gathered on Mackinac Island that the planned EV tax cuts in the bill “imperiled” the $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park.

Now Ford can move ahead with opening the facility as planned in 2026 with assurances that it could qualify for the Biden-era credits for manufacturers in effect when it launched construction in 2023 due to changes in how the US views the automaker’s relationship with a Chinese battery maker.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford spokesperson Jessica Enoch told Bridge in a statement on Tuesday.

Qualifying for the tax credit, she continued, is “a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

The factory is among Michigan’s largest manufacturing projects inked during the administration of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Originally valued at $3.5 billion, it promised 2,500 jobs in the community east of Battle Creek,

Facing concerns about EV profitability and battery capacity, Ford (NYSE:F) hit pause on the project after the state committed over $1.3 billion in public funding, including tax breaks and land development.

The automaker [NYSE:F] later reinstated its plans to build EV batteries with the less-expensive LFP technology, licensed from Chinese partner CATL.

But this year, the Trump administration vowed to end federal subsidies for the EV market. The production credit — along with several other clean energy credits, including the $7,500 credit for buyers of many EVs — had been eliminated in the House and early Senate versions of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The move prompted Ford’s warnings, saying it was not fair to change the funding mid-stream, even as he said he agreed with the motives “to have a strong American industrial base.”

The sticking point became scrutiny by lawmakers of the CATL deal due to strained US-Chinese relations, prompting questions about Ford’s affiliation with the “foreign entity of concern.”

The Senate, after more than a month of lobbying by Ford, set the tax break criteria on “effective control” in the partnership, the Automotive News reported Tuesday.

The Dearborn automaker has said it is in control because it owns the site in Marshall and its equipment, the publication said, while CATL trains Ford workers.

Under the new revisions, the 45X Advance Manufacturing Production Credit will provide a credit of $35 per kWh for battery cells and $10 per kWh for modules. The bill says EV batteries must contain 60% U.S. content in 2026, increasing to 85% in 2030.

With the factory’s capacity reaching 20 gigawatt hours per year, the tax break could be worth tens of millions to Ford annually.

While Ford proceeds with its plans to open in Marshall in 2026, critics of CATL’s involvement are not comforted by the bill’s distinction of who’s in control.

“The nature of the ‘deal’ between Ford and China-based and Chinese Communist Party (CCP)- tied CATL remains high risk and volatile, both for our national security and taxpayers,” said Joseph Cella of Michigan, who served as US ambassador to Fiji.

The alliance remains “politically fraught,” Cella said. “I trust the Trump administration will continue to fortify the provision of our common defense from the threat presented by the CCP to our national and economic security.”

Marshall business leaders who were instrumental in the Ford deal are relieved by the final bill, they said. Many raised concerns about the end of the tax credit and emphasized over the last month that they are counting on this project’s economic boost.

“We are thrilled to hear that President Trump and Congress came together to preserve the pro-growth federal tax policies that ensure families and businesses across southwest Michigan and the state will continue to benefit from Ford’s investment in BlueOval Battery Park,” said James Durian, CEO of Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance.

“When Ford’s facility begins production next year, it will bring back our supply chain to the United States, which will make our country less reliant on – and more competitive with – foreign countries like China,” Durian said.

Even with the production tax credits surviving threatened cuts, Ford is still planning on EV battery production at a time when the market is volatile and rapidly changing. The automaker’s EV division lost $5 billion in 2024, and it projected that loss to widen this year.

The TikToker, who goes by Molesrcool (@molesrcool) recently highlighted a variant of the car that came outfitted with specific options. All of which are able to be easily accessed, swapped out, and fitted to the vehicle by the driver themselves. It’s a difference he seems to believe will grab the attention of commuters. Additionally, he spoke about the car’s use of materials for its body panels. It’s a choice that he thinks consumers will likely appreciate, given its purported resistance to cosmetic damage.

A Modded Slate EV

The TikToker begins his video with a recording of one of the Detroit-based EV makers pick-ups. However, this unit appears to feature some of the customer-added modifications advertised by the brand. It sports a roof rack along with a frame attached to the vehicle’s bed door. Other add-ons to its grill are also immediately visible. Yellow inserts appear to have been fitted into the bumper, along with larger, light gray panel blocks. Furthermore, its unpainted gray de-facto paint job has been covered with a blue wrap. “This is the Slate truck and this is a brand new design,” the social media user can be heard narrating at the top of the clip.

Additionally, he points out the staggered-line silhouette sunset aesthetic created over the headlights. It’s something fans of 1980’s-themed art will more than likely appreciate. “There’s this little detail I love on the front. With this little sunset design on the headlight. And that classic yellow racing stripe looks so good with the blue and black two tone,” he states. Indeed, that similar style is emblazoned on the side of the truck as well in the form of yellow stripes, which also feature the silhouette of palm trees.

Slate Off-Road Tires and Trim Accents

There’s also a more practical modification to the vehicle he directs his attention toward, too. “And then it has these chunky off-road tires which I don’t think I’ve seen on a Slate yet. And they look so good. I thought it looked cool in pictures but it looks even better in person. Like this is a very rugged-looking small truck. And there’s this really cool design language throughout with the exposed screws that really emphasize how easy it’s gonna be to change out parts. Or make repairs, if you need to,” he tells viewers.

Moreover, he remarks that this perceived self-repairability and self-modification philosophy is what’s going to appeal to many potential buyers. “Something really cool that I think Slate is going for is not only offering an affordable truck. But also a truck that’s affordable to own and repair. Which is something really underrated about car ownership.”

Motor History Repeating Itself?

Like the oft-discussed Tesla Cybertruck, the Slate only comes in one unpainted color off the production line. Unlike its more expensive EV counterpart, however, the Slate isn’t made of stainless steel. In fact, the TikToker says despite this gun-metal hue, the Slate’s panels aren’t metallic at all. “One thing that I haven’t seen talked about is the material that the truck is made of. It’s not metal, it’s actually kind of polycarbonate plastic. But it does not feel like plastic. That is very sturdy.”

While some may turn their noses up at the thought of a car lacking metal panels in its panel design, @molesrcool says that this choice is beneficial to drivers. That’s because, by his estimation, these panels are less likely to be dimpled by impact. “And something that’s really cool about that material is that it’s very, very dent resistant. So something like hail is not gonna destroy your truck.”

The business Miller Plastic Products writes on its website that “polycarbonate is one of the strongest plastics on the market. [Also it] can withstand forces nearly 200 times stronger than steel. Equally, Simply Plastics extolled polycarbonate’s stalwartness, too, stating that the material “is considered to be almost unbreakable.” Another business, Trimmers Hardware Company, also shared its love of polycarbonate plastics, stating that the material “is almost impossible to break.” Hygard is another business that utilizes polycarbonate in its product lines and lauds how tough it is. For instance, the laminate polycarbonate it manufactures is used for bullet-proof glass and is designed to withstand ballistics.

Slate: Small Truck, Big Interior?

During his video, @molesrcool had some praise for the capaciousness of the Slate’s cabin. “And while it is a small two door truck, the inside does not feel small,” he opines. Next, he cracks open the Slate’s side passenger door in order to support visual evidence for this claim. Several decorative decals can be seen affixed to the car’s dash. There’s a phone holder affixed near the steering wheel, along with several, soft panels decorated with numerous, tiny holes, resembling speakers. Three separate knobs are featured beneath these gray grills, and there is a large, bifurcated cubby space separating the truck’s seats. “Like this is a very nice, roomy interior,” he says after stepping inside of the Slate. “I’m 6 '3’’ and it has a ton of headroom. Which I love to see,” he states, waving his hand above his noggin to demonstrate how capacious its inside is.

How Slate Made Such a Cheap EV

The Motor City electric car manufacturer is having a Henry Ford Model T moment with its aggressively priced vehicle. Or, at the very least, channeling the U.S. transportation tycoon’s production philosophy. Ford once famously said that Model T buyers can get the car in any color they like, as long as it’s black. Furthermore, Ford is largely attributed for pioneering assembly line production.

This specialized form of labor attributing sole tasks to different workers ensured that these processes were fine-tuned through rote and repetition. Thus, vehicles could be churned out at breakneck paces. While electric vehicles are becoming more affordable, the Slate truck’s $20,000 entry-level market point effectively prices the vehicle against budget internal combustion engine vehicles.

Similarly, the Model T is largely cited as the first truly affordable car available to U.S. consumers. Thus, popularizing it en masse, and reshaping the country as a result. Prior to its release, automobiles were considered by many to be aspirational, luxury vehicles that couldn’t fit into most people’s lifestyles due to the fact that they cost so much to purchase. Then, there’s other operational costs associated with purchasing a bespoke vehicle.

Tesla captivated people’s attention by creating a sexy EV. Leonardo DiCaprio famously visited a Tesla gigafactory and spoke with Elon Musk on camera about the brand’s EVs. In 2017, Larry David was seen driving Ted Danson’s red Model S in Curb Your Enthusiasm, further highlighting the brand.

Slate: A DIY EV

And while it can be argued that a Model 3 with tax incentives is much cheaper than base MSRP offerings from luxury manufacturers, there’s the question of longevity. Of course, there’s been tales of Tesla road warriors going hundreds of miles without needing major repairs. But horror stories of control arm faults and battery fires have given potential EV buyers pause. It doesn’t help that the brand has become the most recalled automaker in recent years, either. Other EV manufacturers are churning out vehicles that are too rich for their blood, even if their designs invoke more wallet-friendly options. Specifically, the Volkswagen ID Buzz.

If Tesla was the brand to convince people that EVs can be viable daily drivers, then Slate’s pickup is the Model T bringing all-electric driving to the people. Because the brand seems to be honing in on fears that owning and operating an EV can be a costly endeavor.

Streamlining production costs, like cutting out a $350 million investment for paint jobs alone, is a big deal. Plus, allowing Slate owners to trick out their car incrementally with DIY-friendly kits, may convince more folks to make the jump. It doesn’t hurt that public EV charging has seen massive improvements in the last year, giving drivers more peace of mind when they’re out and about. And since they’re outfitted with North American Charging Standard ports, Tesla Supercharging functionality is likely in the cards. Which means that the Slate will have plenty of options for fast charging, too.

You can reserve one today. The trucks are expected to be available in late 2026.

This load growth will pose a serious challenge to PJM in ensuring that it can support the required generation and transmission capacity. Dominion Energy, the main utility serving the market, has said it has approximately 40GW of data center capacity in various stages of contracting as of December 2024, an 88 percent increase from July 2024.

“Adding the 10-15GW of firm generation capacity needed to supply these data centers and keep the lights on in Virginia will not be easy. It can take three to four years for the transmission organization just to greenlight a new generator, and market prices are currently too low for developers to build the kind of capacity required,” said Zachary Edelen, PJM research lead at Aurora Energy Research.

The report notes that while low-carbon energy will supply some of the energy needed, it is unlikely to meet it all, barring huge changes in incentives and regulations, which are not forthcoming.

As a result, Aurora contends that natural gas generation will make up the majority of new generation additions. “Our analyses consistently show that data centers bolster the business case for natural gas generators, meaning state and federal governments will need to do more if they want to decarbonize,” said Edelen.

Capacity rises are also expected to lead to fixed costs for reliability to rise significantly by the late 2020s. According to its research across the Mid-Atlantic, these costs could rise by more than 400 percent, which could lead to data centers beginning to “start locating elsewhere, following where electricity is cheaper,” said Edelen.

In addition, despite PJM’s projections, data center additions in the northern Virginia region could slow as other regions become more attractive. States such as Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina are competing with Virginia’s tax breaks with incentives of their own, and with increasing local opposition to new builds, there is a chance Virginia could begin to fall out of favor.

This, in turn, could mean less demand for new generators in the Mid-Atlantic.

Washington, D.C. – Today, the House Appropriations Committee released the Fiscal Year 2026 bill for the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. The bill will be considered in subcommittee tomorrow, July 15th at 10:00 a.m. The markup will be live-streamed and can be found on the Committee’s website(link is external).

Interior and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson said, “As Congress works to rein in unnecessary spending and restore fiscal responsibility, the House Appropriations Committee remains committed to ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and efficiently. The Fiscal Year 2026 Interior and Environment Appropriations Act does just that by right-sizing federal agencies, promoting domestic energy and mineral production, and reversing harmful Biden-era policies. Among many provisions, I am pleased that this bill protects important programs that states and local communities rely on, like the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, critical investments in Indian Country, and Wildland Fire Management. I thank Chairman Cole for his leadership and look forward to getting this bill across the finish line.”

Chairman Tom Cole said, “This bill reflects strong stewardship of America’s natural and financial resources. It directs the management of our public lands, recreation, and energy development while cutting millions in wasteful spending. It prioritizes undoing costly, burdensome Biden-era regulations to protect U.S. jobs and promote growth. I am also proud that this legislation safeguards the sacred oath our nation made to protect Native American communities. Chairman Simpson’s approach honors both our commitment to preserve America’s natural heritage and our duty to ensure a strong, sustainable, and fiscally responsible future.”

Fiscal Year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill

The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill provides a total discretionary allocation of $37.971 billion, which is $2.54 billion (6%) below the Fiscal Year 2025 enacted level and prioritizes unleashing American energy, defunding Biden-era rulemakings that have hamstrung farmers and industry, and rightsizing agency funding levels, including a $2.1 billion reduction (23%) to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The bill fully funds the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, estimated at $550 million, and prioritizes funding for Tribes and Wildland Fire Management.

Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years.
The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row.

In some ways, Trump’s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats and Republicans don’t agree on much, but they share a conviction that the government should help American manufacturers, one way or another.

Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers. Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes — tariffs — around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.

The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.

The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.

“The past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,” said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. “We didn’t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we’ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.”

Big economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.

Government policy was meant to help.

Biden’s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom – investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 – that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.

But the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden’s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, “manufacturing production will continue to flatline.”

“If production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,” Zandi said. “Manufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.”

Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers — and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America — by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.

In some ways, Trump’s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But “when you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,” Zuzick said. “So that’s definitely a situation where it’s beneficial.”

But American factories import and use foreign products, too – machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.

Consider steel. Trump’s tariffs don’t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices – and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.

In fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France — and pay Trump’s tariff.

Trump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.

The flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: “Customers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,” a fabricated metal products company said.

“Tariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,” added a computer and electronics firm. “The situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.”

Some may argue that things aren’t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they’ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.

Factories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.

Suddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off – and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 — the most since 1994 — and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.

But in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.

In the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.

“It’s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,” said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden’s White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products said that it will take time to see if Trump’s tariffs succeed in bringing factories back to America.

“The fact is that manufacturing doesn’t turn on a dime,” he said. “It takes time to switch gears.”

Hagopian at Pilot Precision is hopeful that tax breaks in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will help American manufacturing regain momentum.

“There may be light at the end of the tunnel that may not be a locomotive bearing down,” he said.

For now, manufacturers are likely to delay big decisions on investing or bringing on new workers until they see where Trump’s tariffs settle and what impact they have on the economy, said Ned Hill, professor emeritus in economic development at Ohio State University.

“With all this uncertainty about what the rest of the year is going to look like,” he said, “there’s a hesitancy to hire people just to lay them off in the near future.”

“Everyone,” said Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products, ”is kind of just waiting for the new normal.’

“If the air quality is bad, I stay inside or carry my inhaler everywhere.” As a neuroscience student, she worries that pollution’s effects go further than most people realize.
In 2022, New Haven launched a citywide sensor network to track air quality in real time.
The sensors confirmed what many residents had long believed: major differences in air pollution exist between neighborhoods.
Despite progress, New Haven still records multiple bad air days each summer and remains vulnerable to outside threats like wildfire smoke.","The air turned orange—and the whole city felt it.

As smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed New Haven in 2023, it sent fine particle pollution soaring to more than 15 times the normal daily level. The sky turned hazy, health officials urged residents to stay inside, and what once seemed like gradual progress toward cleaner air suddenly felt alarmingly fragile.

New Haven’s air quality has improved overall in recent years. But the gains aren’t equally shared—and they’re easily reversed by climate events and policy setbacks. Residents in lower-income areas, often near highways and industrial sites, still breathe some of the dirtiest air in the state.

Dr. Mark Mitchell, a public health physician and founder of the Connecticut Coalition for Environmental Justice, said these disparities are rooted in planning decisions made decades ago.

“Highways were often built right through Black and Latino neighborhoods,” Dr. Mitchell explained. “People of color are more likely to live near polluting sources like power plants, highways, and airports—and they suffer the health consequences.”

He pointed to elevated rates of asthma, cancer, and even neurodevelopmental issues like ADHD and autism—issues that emerging science links to long-term pollution exposure.

Government data backs up these concerns. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality System, average annual levels of PM2.5 (which stands for fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers) in New Haven dropped from 8.6 micrograms per cubic meter in 2015 to 6.2 in 2024—nearing proposed federal health targets.

These particles include tiny bits of pollution from engines, heating systems, wildfires and industrial activity.

But 2023 was a cautionary tale: wildfire smoke pushed the annual average back up to 8.7, a level not seen since the previous decade. Fortunately, by 2024, levels dropped again, thanks in part to shifting weather patterns and fewer fire-related events.

Still, long-term averages hide dangerous seasonal peaks. PM2.5 levels climb in both summer and winter due to vehicle emissions, wildfires, heating fuel, and imported pollution. Ozone levels, which worsen in summer sun, spike most dramatically in July.

For people with preexisting health conditions, these aren’t just numbers.

Khaoula Boulhadi, a 22-year-old neuroscience student at Southern Connecticut State University and New Haven resident, has lived with asthma since childhood.

“My asthma gets way worse in the summer,” she said. “If the air quality is bad, I stay inside or carry my inhaler everywhere.”

As a neuroscience student, she worries that pollution’s effects go further than most people realize.

“It’s not just asthma,” she said. “Pollution is tied to learning problems, mental health, and even brain development.”

To older residents like Stella Owens, 79, the pollution isn’t new. Owens still lives on Ella T. Grasso Boulevard, where she grew up.

“You’d wipe your windows, and it was black,” she said. “That’s what we were breathing.”

She acknowledged that some things have improved, but added: “Just because you can’t see the pollution every day doesn’t mean it’s not there.”

Owens remembers the days before catalytic converters and clean air regulations. But the same neighborhoods that once sat beside dirty bus depots and oil furnaces now face new forms of risk—like highway truck emissions or wildfire smoke.

Another thing that’s changed is how clearly those risks can now be measured.

In 2022, New Haven launched a citywide sensor network to track air quality in real time. The sensors confirmed what many residents had long believed: major differences in air pollution exist between neighborhoods.

Fresh data from the summer of 2024 backs this up, showing that some areas still face far worse air than others. Between June and August, publicly available air quality sensors operated by the city showed that average levels of PM2.5 were consistently higher in areas near industrial sites and busy roads.

In the Annex, which borders the port and airport, the average PM2.5 level was about 9.5 micrograms per cubic meter of air. That’s just below the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s new annual safety limit of 9. In Fair Haven, a neighborhood near I-91, the average was around 8.0. By comparison, East Rock measured 7.0, and Westville—farther from traffic and industry—had the cleanest readings at about 6.5.

These findings come from the city’s Engineering Department, which publishes real-time data from 11 low-cost sensors located across New Haven. The sensors are part of a public dashboard available on the city’s website and through the PurpleAir sensor network.

“People deserve to know what they’re breathing,” Mayor Justin Elicker said at the program’s launch.

The new data is already helping residents advocate for environmental justice and make informed decisions about their health.

Despite progress, New Haven still records multiple bad air days each summer and remains vulnerable to outside threats like wildfire smoke. For environmental justice communities— like the Hill, Fair Haven, and Dixwell—the stakes are especially high. These neighborhoods have higher asthma rates and are often closer to highways, rail yards, and polluting facilities.

If nothing changes, those who contribute least to pollution—like residents without cars— will continue to suffer the most.

“It’s an injustice that people who don’t even drive are breathing in pollution from the highway they live next to,” Dr. Mitchell said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/360ab18/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5881x3088+0+413/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F42%2F6c%2Fb74b64df41ddbaa9d4f159854769%2F230608-new-haven-smoke-3.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:29:41.200761

The legislation extends the tax cuts enacted in Trump’s first term and directs hundreds of billions of dollars of new spending to defense and immigration enforcement. To offset those costs, the bill also makes historic cuts to spending on social safety-net programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Nonpartisan estimates have said cuts in the bill will cause at least 17 million Americans to lose their health coverage.

That won’t happen all at once, though.

The key provisions in Trump’s law, which he called the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will take effect at different times over several years. Thefacets of the lawhave varying degrees of popularity with the American public, according to a recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll. Many of the more unpopular policies in the legislation will not kick in until after the 2026 midterm elections, possibly minimizing the political damage to Republicans that some in their party previously warned the bill could inflict. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency that vets the cost of major legislation, projects the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Here’s a look at when certain provisions from the legislation are scheduled to take effect.

2025 changes

Extended tax cuts, new SNAP work requirements and the end of EV and green home credits

Effective right away, the new law permanently extends trillions of dollars of tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term that otherwise were set to expire at the end of this year. Those included cuts for corporate businesses and for all income levels, though the highest-earning households saw the biggest benefits. The new law also raises the limit on how much people can deduct in state and local taxes - known as theSALT cap- from their federal returns, from $10,000 to $40,000 a year.

Under the new GOP bill, the standard deduction will increase to $15,750 for an individual ($31,500 for a married couple filing jointly) and the child tax credit will increase from $2,000 to $2,200 per child, to be adjusted for inflation each year. However, some noncitizens are now barred from claiming the latter, even if their children are American citizens.

Also essentially kicking in right away are many of the policies Trump promised during his campaign, such as no taxes on tips, overtime compensation or car-loan interest. A worker earning less than $150,000 a year can exclude up to $25,000 of tip income and up to $12,500 of overtime compensation from being taxed. People age 65 and older earning up to $75,000 a year can deduct an additional $6,000, with lower deductions for those earning more. The deductions are all retroactive to Jan. 1and can be claimed when filing taxes next year.

Finally, the law mandates new, more stringent work requirements for those on SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. Adults aged 19-64 who don’t have dependents must prove they are working, volunteering or going to school for a certain number of hours each month to qualify for federal food assistance. (SNAP’s previous work requirements apply to adult recipients up to 54 years old, without dependents.) Requirements will be phased in now through 2029, depending on how states look to supplement the program without federal help. Groups that are likely to see benefit changes this year are veterans, parents with children 14 to 17 years of age, foster youths and people between 55 and 65 years old.

What’s getting cut this year? The legislation ends several green- and clean-energy initiatives enacted under President Joe Biden. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022, certain electric vehicle purchases qualified for a tax credit for anywhere from $4,000 to $7,500. That incentive is nowset to end on Sept. 30,instead of in 2032.

Other credits for green home improvement projects - including the Residential Clean Energy Credit and the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit - are also due to sunset on Dec. 31 because of the GOP law. Those credits have been offered for the purchase and installation of things like household solar panels, home batteries and solar water heaters, as well as for homeowners to upgrade to more energy-efficient appliances or improve insulation.

2026 changes

Higher health insurance premiums, student loan restrictions leading up to the midterms

As the new coverage year starts for health insurance plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, people are likely to see new restrictions and higher premiums because of Trump’s law that allows pandemic-era enhanced subsidies to expire at the end of 2025. The CBO estimates that 4.2 million people will lose insurance as a result of losing those subsidies that made coverage affordable.

On June 30, 2026,credits for installing a home EV charger will end.

Several new restrictions and changes to federal student loan programs are set to kick in on July 1, 2026.Being eliminated are the Graduate PLUS student loan program, as well as the SAVE, PAYE and ICR student loan repayment plans, which are based on income level. New student loan borrowers must choose between one of two repayment plans approved under the new GOP legislation. Parent PLUS loans - which previously allowed parents to borrow up to a student’s full cost of attendance - also will be capped at $20,000 per year, or $65,000 total per student.

Throughout the year, both parties are expected to use the changes enacted in the law as campaign fodder for the midterm elections on Nov. 3, 2026, with Republicans likely to tout the tax cuts that will have already gone into effect. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has projected confidence Republicans will not lose seats because of the legislation, even as Democrats have seized on its unpopularity to kick-start their efforts to take back the House majority next year.

2027 changes

New Medicaid work requirements, shifting some SNAP payment costs to states, shorter ACA enrollment period

With midterm elections in the rearview mirror, this is the year that the least popular aspects of the law are set to take effect. Jan. 1, 2027, is the deadline for most states to implement new Medicaid work requirements for people who became eligible for Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the program, though some states may get exemptions for up to two years. Similar to the new SNAP work requirements, adults 19-64 will have to prove they are working, volunteering or going to school for a certain number of hours per month to qualify for Medicaid.

The bill provides exemptions for certain groups, including those who are pregnant, disabled or taking care of dependent children 13 or younger - but those recipients could still lose their health insurance if they don’t submit paperwork proving their exemption. The bill requires that states conduct an extra eligibility check every six months, starting in 2027, which could open the door to people losing coverage midyear.

On Oct. 1, 2027, most states will begin to be required to cover some SNAP benefit costs previously covered entirely by the federal government. The amount will be based on a state’s “error rate,” or how accurately a state has calculated eligibility for the food-assistance program. The higher a state’s error rate, the greater a percentage of SNAP benefit costs it will have to pay. Experts warn that shifting the cost from federal to state governments could jeopardize SNAP users, farmers and state budgets.

An exception to the above? States with the highest error rates will be granted a two-year delay from taking on some SNAP benefit costs - one of the last-minute carve-outs made to persuade Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to vote for the bill.

Starting in November 2027, the GOP tax law will shrink the open enrollment period for the ACA marketplace from two months to one month.

2028 changes

New out-of-pocket costs for low-income Medicaid recipients - and the next presidential election

This is the year that most permanent funding changes to Medicaid kick in, namely the gradual reduction of provider taxes and state-directed payments that experts say are likely to cause states to have to make cuts to their programs. The Trump administration has cast the cuts as “strengthening Medicaid by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,” but the CBO projected the nearly $1 trillion cuts to Medicaid alone will result in 11.8 million more uninsured Americans by 2034.

July 1, 2028,is the deadline forstudent loan borrowers to change to one of the two new repayment plans approved under Trump’s law.

Starting Oct. 1, 2028,those who became eligible for Medicaid under the ACA’s expansion of the program in 2010 - and whose income is from 100 percent to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (roughly $32,000 to $44,000 for a family of four) - will begin to pay new out-of-pocket costs of up to $35 per service, which experts have said is likely to lead low-income recipients to avoid seeking care.

Possibly the changes that will affect the largest swaths of the population will take place at the end of the year, after the election of a new president. On Dec. 31, 2028,the temporary tax provisions for tips, overtime compensation, seniors, car-loan interest and state and local tax deductions will expire. However, the extension of the 2017 tax cuts - including for corporate businesses and higher-income households - will remain because the law made them permanent.

In the poll of 2,000 American adults, three-quarters (75%) said they want to reduce the negative effects of their lifestyle and purchases on Mother Earth.

Seasonality may have some influence here, as 64% of those admitted it’s easier to be eco-friendly during the summertime.

But even still, almost seven in 10 (69%) are adopting green living this season and shaping their habits and routines to be as sustainable and eco-conscious as possible.

For many, green living just looks like recycling (78%) and creating less trash (66%). Sixty-four percent are also working to conserve water and 58% are using less electricity.

Conducted by Talker Research and commissioned by Watermelon.org, the study also found that most (87%) feel it’s important to be environmentally responsible during the summer to reduce waste and pollution, given the amount of events, holidays and parties during the season.

And based on respondents’ tips for green living, the survey found that sustainability isn’t complicated. Many shared advice that centered on conscious consumption and taking a “less is more” approach to shopping.

A number of respondents make a point to compost their food waste and avoid plastic packaging when shopping. Other eco-friendly tips include “Carry a reusable kit — a water bottle, shopping bag and utensil set everywhere you go,” “Incorporate new habits into your lifestyle and they become normal” and “Turn the water off when you brush your teeth.”

Respondents summarized how easy it is to live green by saying, “Just be conscious of every little thing you do. You never know when you will be able to do something in a more sustainable manner” and simply “Buy produce that is not packed in a bag of plastic.”

And this summer, many (29%) are grocery shopping for items with minimal packaging, along with foods that are quick and easy to prepare (64%).

Nutrient-density (44%) is also important to people when grocery shopping, along with taking home hydrating foods (35%).

Top summer grocery haul items from the survey include high-protein selections like chicken (74%) and eggs (68%), along with hydration-rich foods like watermelon (68%), greens (66%) and tomatoes (63%).

""There's a handful of considerations people have when grocery shopping during the summertime and, at times, it can feel overwhelming,” said Stephanie Barlow, senior director of communications at Watermelon.org. “Many people are balancing rising grocery prices and their needs for healthy, sustainable and hydrating foods. Eating watermelon can check all these boxes since it’s affordable, nutrient-dense, hydrating and uses minimal or no plastic packaging.""

In the survey, respondents were asked about their health goals and the study found that consuming more healthy foods (78%) and drinking more water (76%) are adults’ top wellness priorities.

And for respondents with kids (61%), their biggest health goals for their kids are also improving their hydration (50%) and healthy food intake (47%).

So it’s no surprise that nearly a third of adults (31%) confessed they’re typically dehydrated on any given summer day and more than a fifth of parents (22%) admitted they struggle to get their kids to drink enough water.

To help with this, the majority of parents surveyed (66%) divulged that they feed their kids water-rich foods during the summertime to “sneak” some hydration in.

And the most popular hydrating foods respondents enjoy on summer days are watermelon (74%), strawberries (54%), oranges (46%) and cucumber (46%).

This corresponds nicely with both survey respondents and their kids’ favorite summertime fruit being watermelon (60% and 51% respectively).

“If you’re struggling to stay hydrated during the heat of the summer, try eating some watermelon,” said Barlow. “Or if you just want a cool, refreshing snack, watermelon is perfect for that too.”

Survey methodology:

Talker Research surveyed 2,000 general population Americans; the survey was commissioned by Watermelon.org and administered and conducted online by Talker Research between June 17 and June 23, 2025.

We are sourcing from a non-probability frame and the two main sources we use are:

Traditional online access panels — where respondents opt-in to take part in online market research for an incentive

Programmatic — where respondents are online and are given the option to take part in a survey to receive a virtual incentive usually related to the online activity they are engaging in

Those who did not fit the specified sample were terminated from the survey. As the survey is fielded, dynamic online sampling is used, adjusting targeting to achieve the quotas specified as part of the sampling plan.

Regardless of which sources a respondent came from, they were directed to an Online Survey, where the survey was conducted in English; a link to the questionnaire can be shared upon request. Respondents were awarded points for completing the survey. These points have a small cash-equivalent monetary value.

Cells are only reported on for analysis if they have a minimum of 80 respondents, and statistical significance is calculated at the 95% level. Data is not weighted, but quotas and other parameters are put in place to reach the desired sample.

Interviews are excluded from the final analysis if they failed quality-checking measures. This includes:

Speeders: Respondents who complete the survey in a time that is quicker than one-third of the median length of interview are disqualified as speeders

Open ends: All verbatim responses (full open-ended questions as well as other please specify options) are checked for inappropriate or irrelevant text

Bots: Captcha is enabled on surveys, which allows the research team to identify and disqualify bots

Duplicates: Survey software has “deduping” based on digital fingerprinting, which ensures nobody is allowed to take the survey more than once

It is worth noting that this survey was only available to individuals with internet access, and the results may not be generalizable to those without internet access.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/20/5201e938-e96a-5cd6-80c3-84e861aac478/68750d9b70014.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-14 14:32:36.951793

State lawmakers have not yet reached a budget agreement, and the fate of the Solar for Schools program remains uncertain.","A bipartisan program aimed at helping Pennsylvania schools install solar panels is at risk due to the potential loss of a key federal tax credit and uncertain state funding.

The Solar for Schools initiative, launched with $25 million in last year’s state budget, has already allocated $22.5 million to school districts, intermediate units, and community colleges across the state. A total of 73 projects have received grants ranging from $40,000 to $500,000.

The program was structured to allow schools to use state grants for half of their project costs, while a federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act would cover the remainder. However, a new tax and spending bill signed by former President Donald Trump requires schools to begin construction before July 2026 or complete it by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credit.

Without the federal funding, some schools may have to cancel or scale back their plans. The grants are reimbursement-based, meaning schools must complete projects to receive funding.

Upper Darby School District received the largest total grant at $2.3 million across six schools. Tunkhannock Area School District in Wyoming County received over $1.7 million for eight projects. Districts must now weigh whether to proceed with projects amid rising uncertainty.

Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler (D–Philadelphia), who sponsored the program, said state funding is still possible and emphasized that solar projects are viable even without the full federal credit, though they take longer to recoup costs.

In its first year, the program received three times more funding requests than available. The remaining $2.5 million was earmarked for western Pennsylvania but was not fully claimed due to a lack of applicants. The Department of Community and Economic Development plans to distribute those funds in a future round.

Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R–Indiana) has expressed concern over continued funding due to the state’s budget deficit. He also cited a pending state Supreme Court ruling on a carbon cap-and-trade program as a reason for delaying energy-related legislation, including Solar for Schools.

Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R–Washington), whose district saw nearly $1 million awarded to local schools, supports the program and called it a “small investment with a huge return.”

The new federal policy also affects other clean energy programs in Pennsylvania, including hydrogen production tax credits and homeowner energy efficiency incentives.

ICICI Prudential plans a ₹10,000 crore offer-for-sale, while INOX aims to raise ₹6,000 crore through a mix of fresh issue and OFS. Other filers include Orient Cables, Aggcon Equipments International, and Kiaasa Retail, targeting varied capital raises across sectors.

In Detail : Five companies, including ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company and INOX Clean Energy, submitted draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) last week, signaling a busy period for India’s primary market. These filings span sectors such as finance, clean energy, manufacturing, and retail, indicating broad investor interest.

ICICI Prudential AMC’s draft red herring prospectus outlines a pure offer-for-sale of 1.76 crore equity shares by its foreign partner, Prudential Corporation Holdings. The issue, expected to raise around ₹10,000 crore, will not involve a fresh issue of shares, meaning the asset management company won’t receive any proceeds directly.

INOX Clean Energy, a major player in India’s renewable energy sector, plans to raise ₹6,000 crore through a combination of fresh issue and offer-for-sale. The company aims to boost its market presence and support its ambitious growth plans in solar, wind, and green hydrogen projects. This could become one of the country’s largest clean energy IPOs.

In addition to these two major players, three other companies also filed IPO documents. Orient Cables seeks to raise approximately ₹700 crore, Aggcon Equipments International is targeting ₹332 crore, and fashion retailer Kiaasa Retail has filed for a smaller, fresh issue to fund its expansion plans.

Market analysts see ICICI Prudential’s offering as a strategic exit for Prudential Holdings, while INOX’s IPO is expected to help finance its aggressive capacity expansion plans. The clean energy firm’s robust pipeline and capital expenditure strategy are likely to attract environmentally conscious investors.

By the end of the decade, Goldman expects power demand driven by data centers to rise 160% from 2023 levels.
They currently account for 3% of US power demand, which is expected to increase to 8% by 2030.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant driver of this trend, which Goldman says will account for 20% of total US data center demand by 2030.
Approximately 40% of the added capacity to meet data center demand, or 19 GW, will be generated from clean energy sources.","At the beginning of the year, Goldman Sachs Research analyzed the future of nuclear power. Pulling from American, European, and global-focused reports by authors including Carly Davenport, Jim Schneider, and Brian Singer, the company stated, “Nuclear power will be a key part of a suite of new energy infrastructure built to meet surging data-center power demand driven by artificial intelligence.” However, they noted that nuclear alone will not be able to meet America’s energy needs. “Natural gas, renewables, and battery technology will also have a role to play.”

Overall, American power demand is set to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.4% over the rest of the decade. This represents an increase from Goldman’s prior estimate of a 1.7% CAGR that did not account for data centers. The significance of this jump should not be underestimated. Goldman wrote, “Not since the start of the century has US electricity demand grown 2.4% over an eight-year period, with US annual power generation over the last 20 years averaging less than 0.5% growth.” The last decade, in fact, averaged at 0% growth.

By the end of the decade, Goldman expects power demand driven by data centers to rise 160% from 2023 levels. Data centers currently use 1% to 2% of the world’s power, which is expected to increase to 3% to 4% by 2030. They currently account for 3% of US power demand, which is expected to increase to 8% by 2030.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant driver of this trend, which Goldman says will account for 20% of total US data center demand by 2030. Even though the company expects increased efficiency per AI server later in the decade, it still sees AI-driven power demand increasing approximately 200 terawatt-hours (TWh) between 2023 and 2030.

Goldman predicts that this data center demand will translate into more than $50 billion in capital investment for building 47 GW of domestic generation capacity between 2024 and 2030. Approximately 40% of the added capacity to meet data center demand, or 19 GW, will be generated from clean energy sources. They are cheaper, Goldman argues. On average, onshore wind at a data center location costs $25 per megawatt-hour (MWh), while solar costs $26/MWh, and combined cycle natural gas costs $37/MWh.

However, the team acknowledged the limitations of renewable resources, including the costs of transmitting the energy across large distances, variance in the strength of sunlight or wind based on the day and time of year, and the limited time they generate power daily: approximately six hours for solar and nine hours for wind. “Our conversations with renewable developers indicate that wind and solar could serve roughly 80% of a data center’s power demand if paired with storage, but some sort of baseload generation is needed to meet the 24/7 demand,” Jim Schneider explained.

Therefore, the researchers predicted an all-of-the-above approach to energy that incorporates a variety of different resources. Brian Singer, global head of GS SUSTAIN, wrote, “Our outlook on power demand growth warrants an ‘and’ approach, not an ‘or’ approach, as we see ample opportunities for generation growth across sources.”

While they expect natural gas to meet 60% of this need by 2030, or 28 GW, the Goldman researchers maintained that nuclear power would become a part of the mix later on. In the US report, the researchers noted that they expect to see fewer closures of nuclear plants during this decade and that beyond this timeframe, small modular reactors (SMRs) could play a pivotal role. Schneider stated that although natural gas and renewables will be utilized in the short term, nuclear energy will be a preferred longer-term solution to meet baseload power needs.

Goldman Sachs’ research points to several factors contributing to their suspicion that new nuclear plants could be operational by 2030:

Boosted investor confidence in electricity demand growth;

Increased corporate desires for low-carbon energy sources;

American companies signed contracts for 10 GW of new nuclear capacity in the past year alone; and,

Governments in attendance at 2023’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) agreed to triple global nuclear capacity by mid-century.

As the researchers wrote in the global report, “We have assumed 5 GW of nuclear PPAs coming online in 2030 to reflect credit for some early success/development — the next 1-2 years will be key to guide timeline and magnitude.” By 2040, however, the company predicts that global nuclear generating capacity will increase by about 200 GW from 9% of the global electricity mix to 12%. They currently count 85 reactors in the planning phase worldwide, and an additional 359 are proposed. They summarized, “While we do not anticipate all of these planned and proposed reactors to come online, we think this statistic is still noteworthy in highlighting the level of activity in the industry.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/488982402_1108257924676473_139898810099230959_n-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:36:37.999436

Trump won the election, in part, by promising to lower inflation and cut US energy costs in half within a year.
This will push up energy costs across the US, particularly in states that have not enacted their own policies to boost renewables.
“We’ve seen US power prices generally fall over the past 75 years, but with this bill for the first time we will see sustained increases in power costs.
Around 34m households, more than a quarter of all dwellings in the US, reported difficulties in paying energy bills in 2020.","The cost of electricity is poised to surge across the US in the wake of Republican legislation that takes an axe to cheap renewable energy, with people in states who voted for Donald Trump last year to be hardest hit by the increase in bills.

As air conditioners crank up across the US during another sweltering summer amid an unfolding climate crisis, rising energy costs will become even more severe for households due to the reconciliation spending bill passed by Republicans in Congress and signed by Trump, who called it the “big, beautiful bill”, on 4 July.

By stripping away support for cheap solar and wind energy production, the legislation is set to cause electricity rates paid by families and businesses, many already struggling to pay their bills, to rise by much as 18% by 2035, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy thinktank.

Household energy costs, which span electricity and gas use, will rise by $170 on average every year by 2035, the report finds, with Republican-leaning states bearing the brunt of the increases. Bills in Missouri will spike the most, by $640 a year, with the next largest increases – in Kentucky, South Carolina, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Texas – all also hitting states that voted for Trump in last year’s presidential election.

Trump won the election, in part, by promising to lower inflation and cut US energy costs in half within a year. In office, he has sought to boost fossil fuel consumption while slashing incentives for clean energy projects and barring them from federal lands.

“I don’t want windmills destroying our place,” the president said last month. “I don’t want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up a half a mountain that are ugly as hell.”

But the Republican bill’s wiping out of tax credits for renewables will stymie wind and solar projects that are typically now cheaper than gas or coal, forcing utilities to rely more heavily on existing, inefficient gas generators, Energy Innovation said. This will push up energy costs across the US, particularly in states that have not enacted their own policies to boost renewables.

“Demand for electricity is increasing and without renewables we aren’t able to meet that new demand,” said Dan O’Brien, senior analyst at Energy Innovation and author of the new study.

“We’ve seen US power prices generally fall over the past 75 years, but with this bill for the first time we will see sustained increases in power costs. Lower-income folks in rural areas in red states will have compounding impacts from this bill – their states voted to pass this but it will really harm them in the long term.”

Environmental groups were scathing of the Republicans who voted for the reconciliation bill. “After an election where cost-of-living was the driving issue that pushed millions of working-class Americans to check the box for Donald Trump, it’s mind-boggling that Republicans just passed a bill that will raise costs across the board,” said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, a climate change advocacy organization, who called the legislation “one of the most catastrophic bills in a generation”.

Electricity prices for American households have already increased above the rate of inflation since 2022, with a slew of new data centers for artificial intelligence helping push up overall demand for power. This trend has placed further strain upon “energy insecure” people who struggle to meet the cost of heating, cooling and lighting their homes. Around 34m households, more than a quarter of all dwellings in the US, reported difficulties in paying energy bills in 2020.

“A lot of people are struggling and it’s a hardship that’s often not highlighted,” said Michelle Graff, an energy policy expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Lower-income people, as well as those who are Black, Hispanic, elderly, have young children or live in poorly constructed and badly insulated homes, are most at risk of this sort of energy insecurity.

“For a lot of these folks, even $10 extra on their bill each month will result in difficult trade-offs, such as forgoing medicines or food for their families,” Graff said. “Increasing those bills month after month will have a big impact upon households on the margins.”

Electricity price rises are regulated by the states and some jurisdictions offer help to residents struggling to pay their bills, as Maryland did last month.

But such assistance is now being stripped away at the federal level, with the Trump administration seeking to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (or Liheap), which aids around 6m US households with their bills. The reconciliation bill also deletes subsidies for the construction of energy-efficient homes and upgrades to home cooling, heating and insulation systems.

“That is a lifeline for many, many Americans,” Graff said of the Liheap program. “There is this mismatch where the hardships are getting worse while we are cutting assistance for people to address that hardship.”

Across the US, utilities have pushed for $29bn in higher rates so far this year, which is 142% more than the same period in 2024, a recent report found. At least 16 states, meanwhile, allow utilities to cut off power to people during extreme heatwaves if they have not paid their bills. Such cutoffs can prove deadly – last month, Shauna Thomas, a 55-year-old woman, was found dead in her stiflingly hot St Louis, Missouri, apartment after her electricity was halted for non-payment.

“Air conditioning and access to electricity is life-saving, but in most states there are very limited protections for these shut-offs,” said Diana Hernandez, a researcher of energy and health inequities at Columbia University. “People are reluctant to put on their AC because of the fear of a high bill. It’s easy for them to get into a debt spiral and hard for them to get out of it. This can end up as a life-or-death matter.”

Extreme heat is the leading weather-related cause of deaths in the US, with advancing global temperatures due to the burning of fossil fuels causing longer and fiercer heatwaves. This summer in the US is expected to be hotter than the long-term norm for the season, with explosive demand for cooling causing a strain upon the grid in some places – in June, 110,000 people in New York City lost power due to a surge of electricity use during a hot spell.

In the hottest parts of the US, lengthy power blackouts could prove catastrophic. If a prolonged heatwave and a blackout hit Phoenix, Arizona, at the same time, half of the city’s 1.6 million residents would require urgent medical help and 1% of the population would die, a 2023 study warned.

“Climate change is upon us and as it gets hotter and hotter, there will be more hardship that people face in trying to keep themselves cool,” said Hernandez.

“It used to be that people thought about energy access in the winter months, to help keep them warm, but that has changed now. As we keep getting hotter years, this problem isn’t going away.”

Coal plants that are scheduled to close by 2039 would have to cut their emissions 16% by 2030, while those that are set to retire by 2032 would be exempted from the new rule.
Many coal-fired plants added pollution-control systems in the previous decade to comply with MATS regulations.
Some operators have already delayed retirements of their coal-fired plants due to concerns about grid reliability.
For example, Talen Energy recently agreed to delay retirement of its Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant in Maryland until 2029.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) says more than half of planned coal capacity retirements — roughly 58% — are located in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. In total, the operating capacity of U.S. coal-fired power plants is scheduled to fall from 172 gigawatts (GW) in May 2025 to 145 GW by the end of 2028, according to what owners and operators have told EIA.

However, EIA notes that the projected pace of retirements could slow down from May, given the shift in regulatory policies and power market dynamics.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under President Donald Trump has proposed rolling back several regulations that would affect coal-fired generation. Notably, this includes the EPA power plant rule, which would require the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.

Under that requirement, coal plants which plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to reduce or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032. Coal plants that are scheduled to close by 2039 would have to cut their emissions 16% by 2030, while those that are set to retire by 2032 would be exempted from the new rule. Opponents of the EPA power plant rule have argued that its implementation would jeopardize grid reliability and that the emission reduction technologies proposed by the Biden EPA aren’t ready for prime time.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic (MATS) pollutants. The Trump administration has already granted exceptions to 47 companies from MATS standards. The exemption runs from July 8, 2027, to July 8, 2029. Many coal-fired plants added pollution-control systems in the previous decade to comply with MATS regulations.

In April, the EPA released new steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) that limit the discharge of toxic metals and other pollutants in wastewater coming from coal-fired power plants.

Some operators have already delayed retirements of their coal-fired plants due to concerns about grid reliability. For example, Talen Energy recently agreed to delay retirement of its Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant in Maryland until 2029. Talen Energy had previously planned to retire Brandon Shores in June 2025.

In May, the U.S. Department of Energy also ordered a 90-day delay of the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan.

Trump has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

WASHINGTON — Today, House Republicans released the draft fiscal year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies funding bill, which will be considered in subcommittee tomorrow. Instead of lowering the cost of living and confronting the climate crisis, House Republicans are raising utility bills and energy prices. The legislation takes an aggressive anti-environment, pro-pollution stance with crippling cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and policy provisions that endanger public health and fail to confront the climate crisis. The bill also slashes funding for National Parks and arts programs.

The fiscal year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill includes $38 billion, which is $2.9 billion below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level and $9.2 billion above the budget request. The bill also provides $2.9 billion for the Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund.

The legislation:

Raises utility bills by shifting costs onto state and local governments and making electricity more expensive through funding cuts and extreme policies that would cripple renewable energy development.

Worsens the climate crisis by defunding critical Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) work.

Slashes funding for national parks, threatening Americans’ ability to enjoy public lands.

Guts resources for museums, arts, and culture, suppressing Americans’ engagement with the arts and art education.

Favors polluters over public health through dozens of harmful policies that undermine EPA’s ability to regulate pollution.

Promotes environmental discrimination against rural and poor communities by making it more difficult for hardworking people to deal with the rising costs associated with climate change.

Exploits public lands and accelerates ecosystem decline by allowing harmful and dirty mining activities and by removing Endangered Species Act protections for numerous species.

“With the release of the FY26 Interior bill, it’s clear House Republicans are once again pushing an agenda that accelerates the climate crisis, upends our National Parks system, and leaves local communities to fend for themselves—all while undermining the power of the Appropriations Committee and of Congress,” Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member Chellie Pingree (D-ME-01) said. “We are still living with the fallout of last year’s failure to negotiate a full-year funding bill. Instead of correcting course, the bill released today delivers more of the same: it cuts water infrastructure funding, slashes EPA programs, and wipes out environmental justice and climate initiatives. It even blocks the EPA from completing its risk assessment on PFAS in sewage sludge—a forever chemical crisis Maine knows all too well. On top of the environmental attacks, Republicans are taking aim at the arts and cultural institutions that enrich communities and drive local economies. Cutting the NEA, NEH, and Smithsonian silences artistic expression and undermines the jobs, education programs, and cultural spaces that strengthen towns and cities across the country. Any arguments that these irresponsible cuts are somehow fiscally responsible ring hollow in the wake of Republicans adding $3.4 trillion to the national deficit thanks to their disastrous so-called ‘One Big Beautiful Bill.’ I urge my Republican colleagues to come to the table and support the essential work of this subcommittee: protecting public health, conserving our lands and waters, investing in resilience, and ensuring that every community—from rural Maine to urban centers—has access to a healthy environment and a vibrant cultural life.”

“President Trump promised to address the cost-of-living crisis, but instead, he and House Republicans are making it worse. House Republicans’ 2026 Interior funding bill raises utility bills and energy prices to benefit billionaires and big corporations,” Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT-03) said. “Republicans are threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink and taking steps that damage our public lands, promote dirty energy, and hinder our ability to confront the climate crisis. In addition to these dangerous cuts, Republicans’ proposal would mean fewer trips to National Parks and less access to museums and the arts. House Republicans are more focused on lining the pockets of big oil companies than lowering prices for working class, middle class, rural, and vulnerable families; protecting our public health; and preserving the planet.”

If the goal is to create a more sustainable and equitable energy future. Maine should be building on what works—like community solar—not cutting it off at the knees.”

— Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia

BANGOR, ME, UNITED STATES, July 14, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Suncovia, a leading advocate for equitable clean energy solutions, has expressed deep concern over the advancement of Maine’s proposed legislation LD 1777, which aims to significantly alter the state’s net-energy billing (NEB) program and restrict future eligibility for front-of-the-meter projects such as community solar.

LD 1777, which recently passed the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee, would make front-of-the-meter projects ineligible for the current NEB program and tasks the Governor’s Energy Office with creating a successor tariff-rate program. Under the proposed framework, this new rate would be capped at 1.5 times the average of comparable rates in neighboring states—a move that critics say ignores market realities and risks destabilizing current and future clean energy investments.

“This bill threatens to unravel years of progress and investment in Maine’s clean energy economy,” said Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director of the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA). “Retroactive changes like these not only compromise existing projects but also erode public trust and put thousands of future clean energy jobs and customer savings at risk.”

Suncovia shares the growing concerns of clean energy developers, municipalities, and over 110,000 Mainers who rely on net metering bill credits to manage their utility costs. The current NEB structure supports small-scale residential solar as well as large-scale community solar projects, offering vital energy bill offsets in a state where electricity prices remain among the highest in the country.

While LD 1777 purports to address rising electricity costs driven by global gas market volatility and transmission expenses, it instead shifts the burden to clean energy projects without offering a balanced or data-driven alternative. An analysis prepared for the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) showed that while the state’s tariff-rate program yielded a benefit-cost ratio of just 0.76, the kilowatt-hour credit program provided significant net benefits—especially for behind-the-meter installations.

Suncovia acknowledges the complexities of revising NEB programs but urges legislators and regulators to avoid overly blunt measures that disregard prior investments and undermine confidence in Maine’s renewable energy market.

“If the goal is to create a more sustainable and equitable energy future,” said Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia., “Maine should be building on what works—like community solar—not cutting it off at the knees.”

Suncovia calls on Maine’s legislature and the Governor’s Energy Office to adopt a transparent, inclusive, and data-informed approach to program reform—one that ensures predictability for developers, fairness for ratepayers, and continued access to affordable clean energy for all Mainers.

Respectfully, I would ask for some evidence of that assertion. This is a mantra, but no one can produce a receipt. There may be hard left ideologues who want American subjugation via “cleaner energy,” but no market is demanding it. Ask Germany, which just signed a long-term LNG contract last year with the U.S. and buried carbon is not in the equation.

As to geological advantages: While Louisiana may have some great geologic formations to bury carbon, we also have some that are uniquely unsuitable and dangerous for burying carbon. We need to be wise.

Martin says we might lose business to Texas if we don’t “lead” in carbon management. The Texas Railroad Commissioner tells me no such thing is in the plan for the Lone Star State. He sent a letter to the House Natural Resources Committee to that effect. I'd be glad to share that letter with anyone who is interested.

Martin speaks of compliance: I say it is uniquely not our culture to comply with bad things. We shouldn’t bend our knee to climate ideologues who want to take our liberties and land.

Congress and several U.S. states are working together to grow the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry through tax incentives and legislative support.

This movement is seen as a step toward reducing airline emissions and opening new markets for agriculture.

The clean fuel tax credit, originally passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was set to end in 2027. However, a new Republican-led budget law, signed by President on July 4, 2025, extended it through 2029.

Although the law reduced some credits for SAF and reclaimed unused federal grants, the extension still offers vital long-term support.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” said Paul Greenough of Capstone DC, an energy policy advisor group.

Sustainable aviation fuel is critical to helping the airline industry achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The International Air Transport Association says SAF could help reduce 65% of emissions.

Corn ethanol, often used in car fuels, is a key feedstock in making SAF, giving corn-producing states a new economic opportunity.

States like Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Washington have already passed SAF tax credit laws. New proposals in New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin are under consideration.

Wisconsin Rep. David Steffen introduced a bill requiring that SAF be made using only U.S.-sourced materials. He said, “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Despite federal credit reductions, analysts expect the SAF industry will still benefit. U.S. production grew from 5,000 to over 30,000 barrels per day in early 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Airlines continue to push for broader SAF access, and states may now create stronger local incentives to make up for federal policy changes. Together, these efforts could help scale up commercial production and support rural economies.

More info COALition COALition project website Just Transition Mechanism Just Transition Fund EU coal regions in transition Provided by Horizon: The EU Research & Innovation Magazine","An EU research initiative is guiding Europe's coal regions through the transition to renewable energy, while focusing on job creation and clean energy.

The Maritsa Iztok Complex in southeastern Bulgaria stands as a relic of the past. Since the 1950s, its four thermal power stations have powered the region, relying on coal from three nearby open-pit mines.

This type of mining is among the most environmentally damaging, and a long-overdue transition is now underway, promising to reshape the area in the coming years.

This region, home to one of Bulgaria's largest coal mining and power plant complexes, is not alone. Across Europe, there remain 31 coal regions in 11 EU countries, with approximately 200 000 people employed in coal mines and power plants.

In neighbouring Greece, the Western Macedonia region is known for its highly polluting lignite mines and power plants. To the north, Romania's Mureș county also relies heavily on the fossil fuel industry for local employment.

The challenge facing these regions is twofold. They need to rapidly replace coal with renewable sources of energy, while supporting local communities through the transition by creating new jobs and helping people retrain for the future.

Finding shared solutions

Panagiotis Grammelis, research director at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) in northern Greece, is working to make that transition fair and effective.

He leads an important EU-funded initiative that will run until the end of 2026, and is part of a multinational team helping regions in Greece, Bulgaria and Romania develop a shared strategy for moving beyond coal.

""It's not only a technological challenge,"" said Grammelis. ""It's also a social one.""

The initiative, called COALition, takes a bottom-up approach. Regional hubs bring together researchers, policymakers, businesses and communities to shape locally tailored solutions.

While each region has its own challenges, they share common goals: to advance clean energy technologies and manage the social realities of transition.

""We are leaving the coal era and moving into the renewables era,"" said Grammelis. ""We have common problems, common policy issues—and we want a common innovation model to address them.""

Ensuring a fair transition

The urgency is clear. Coal power in the EU has declined steadily since 2003, and in 2024, solar electricity production overtook coal for the first time.

Ensuring a fair transition to renewables is central to the EU's goal of becoming the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. This is facilitated by the Just Transition Mechanism, which will mobilise around €55 billion between 2021 and 2027 to support the shift.

In Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, where a third of jobs are tied to the local mining complex, even introducing the idea of an energy transition can be difficult.

""We're at the very beginning and resistance is still very strong,"" said Dr. Rumyana Grozeva, executive director of the Stara Zagora Regional Economic Development Agency. ""People don't trust that the government can manage this well.""

Grozeva, who has spent most of her life in Stara Zagora, stressed the need for genuine community engagement.

""Transition is not just about planning, it is about communication,"" she said. Encouraging conversations about the energy transition are finally starting to happen.

Grozeva's team is working with local trade unions to identify the new professional skills that will be needed and ensure appropriate vocational training is available.

One example is a gap in hydrogen technology know-how. The team is now preparing proposals to introduce relevant training into the national curriculum.

Grozeva believes the region's future lies in sectors like clean hydrogen, mechatronics and sustainable agriculture.

""These are the areas with the greatest potential for long-term, sustainable growth,"" she said.

Hydrogen on the horizon

Stara Zagora is positioning itself as one of Europe's two hydrogen valleys, thanks to a newly established Centre of Excellence in Hydrogen Technologies. The goal is for the region to produce 500 tonnes of clean hydrogen annually.

The long-term vision is for the entire value chain—from design and production to assembly and energy generation using hydrogen, solar and other renewables—to take place locally.

""Developing such an industrial symbiosis—and the skilled workforce to support it—could be a great opportunity for the region,"" said Grozeva, who stressed the vital importance of international collaboration in promoting the exchange of best practices between the regions.

In Western Macedonia, a similar initiative led by CERTH and supported by the Just Transition Fund is piloting green hydrogen technologies from production through to storage and use. An exchange of experiences between the regions is expected to bring positive results for both sides.

The European Commission's Joint Research Centre estimates that clean energy technologies could create up to 315 000 jobs in former EU coal regions, potentially rising to 460 000 by 2050.

But it is important that the new jobs match those that are being replaced.

""You have to substitute the high salaries of the fossil fuel sector with new positions that can offer similar rates of pay,"" said Grammelis.

Looking ahead, he sees the approach developed in COALition as a potential blueprint for other regions navigating similar shifts.

""This could be a scalable model for fair energy transitions—something that could guide other areas facing the same challenges.""

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago.
Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.
It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.
But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.","Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.

“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.

The poor auction outcomes stem from a plunge in so-called “allowance prices,” the cost of the permits that polluters can purchase in exchange for emissions they generate.
Allowance prices have plummeted from an all-time high of $42 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted to near-historic lows this year of $26 per metric ton, per the report.
Without such legislative and regulatory action, California could continue losing between $600 million and $1 billion in revenue from each quarterly cap-and-trade auction — as likely occurred at the last event in May, the report concluded.
The current low allowance prices, the researchers stressed, may “jeopardize California’s ability to achieve its ambitious climate targets.”","California may have lost up to $3 billion in potential revenue from a signature emissions reduction program over the past year, a new report has found.

The Golden State’s cap-and-trade program — a system that sets emissions caps and distributes tradable credits within that framework — has incurred these losses in response weak auction results, according to the report, published on Monday by nonprofit research group Clean and Prosperous California.

The poor auction outcomes stem from a plunge in so-called “allowance prices,” the cost of the permits that polluters can purchase in exchange for emissions they generate.

Allowance prices have plummeted from an all-time high of $42 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted to near-historic lows this year of $26 per metric ton, per the report.

“These funds would have otherwise been directly invested into communities and used to lower utility bills for ratepayers,” Clayton Munnings, executive director of Clean and Prosperous California, said in a statement.

These allowance prices also show no signs of recovering ahead of an upcoming auction on August 20 — a situation that the authors attributed to legislative uncertainty surrounding the program’s future.

Bolstering future revenue would require several actions, including urgent action from the state legislature to extend the program’s shelf life beyond its current 2030 end-date, the researchers noted.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) would then need to resume relevant rulemaking processes that would allow for the reduction of available permits, the authors added.

Without such legislative and regulatory action, California could continue losing between $600 million and $1 billion in revenue from each quarterly cap-and-trade auction — as likely occurred at the last event in May, the report concluded.

Yet if auction revenues were restored, the authors observed, these funds could help insulate California’s climate change initiatives from setbacks the state is expected to incur from the federal government’s “one big, beautiful bill.”

Following the recent passage of President’s Trump sweeping legislation, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) warned that California’s wildfire-prone communities could suffer from significant cuts to forest management services and to the firefighting workforce.

The bill, according to the governor’s office, could end up slashing forest management services and eliminating the personnel capable of fighting fires.

The governor’s office also said that the bill “unfairly targets green vehicles,” presumably referring to the decision to do away with electric vehicle tax credits.

To revive revenues and reinforce California’s ability to maintain its climate targets, the authors suggested a “swift legislative extension” of the cap-and-trade program. The subsequent rulemaking, they continued, would ideally include permit supply cuts, which in turn would help the Golden State achieve its and 2045 carbon neutrality goals.

The current low allowance prices, the researchers stressed, may “jeopardize California’s ability to achieve its ambitious climate targets.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Newsom_Mueller_AP-SFChron_SantiagoMejia.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-14 10:12:42.113922

Panasonic is investing $4 billion and already has hired approximately 1,000 staff at the De Soto plant.
“Panasonic’s state-of-the-art EV battery plant marks a bright new era in Kansas,” Governor Laura Kelly said.
“The opening of our Kansas factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said.
“This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas.","Governor Laura Kelly and Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland along with many federal and state dignitaries today celebrated with Panasonic Energy the grand opening of the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing plant in the United States. Panasonic is investing $4 billion and already has hired approximately 1,000 staff at the De Soto plant.

“Panasonic’s state-of-the-art EV battery plant marks a bright new era in Kansas,” Governor Laura Kelly said. “The monumental effort that has gone into every aspect of this project has culminated in this historic day as the plant begins mass production of EV batteries. It’s hard to overstate what Panasonic’s investment means to Kansas and the value of the partnership that made it possible.”

The De Soto plant is the largest economic development project in company history — and Kansas history. An estimated $2.5 billion in new economic activity in Kansas will be generated annually by the project.

“The opening of our Kansas factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” Panasonic Energy CEO Kazuo Tadanobu said. “This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas. Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains, and nurturing the next generation of battery talent. This facility represents not only our commitment to the region but also a foundation for long-term collaboration and innovation in the U.S.”

The project is expected to create up to 4,000 new jobs and significantly boost the regional and state economy, supporting an estimated 4,000 additional jobs created by suppliers and community businesses and 16,500 construction jobs, as cited in an independent Wichita State University economic impact study.

“Kansas leaders did the equivalent of kicking down doors and leaping over tall buildings to win this $4 billion investment by Panasonic,” Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland said. “This is a once-in-a-generation move that will power our economy, support thousands of Kansas families and spark opportunity for decades to come. It’s bold. It’s historic. And all Kansans can feel pride today in seeing that our state can do big things again, and that our best days are ahead of us.”

The 300-acre manufacturing plant, which is opening almost three years to the date of the initial announcement, is located in De Soto’s Astra Enterprise Park. The state-of-the-art facility will operate and produce approximately 66 lithium-ion batteries per second. Its infrastructure is broken into two wings, with four battery lines on each wing. At the end of both wings, infrastructure is designed for shipping, packing, and sub-supply vendor spaces for Panasonic partners.

“Panasonic’s new state-of-the-art facility in De Soto is a milestone for our state and a testament to Kansas’ talented workforce and leadership in energy production and innovation,” U.S. Senator Jerry Moran said. “I commend the leadership of Panasonic for choosing the Sunflower State for its U.S. manufacturing site, creating thousands of quality jobs for Kansans and drawing new people to the Midwest. With this investment, we are continuing to make certain Kansas remains a place where the next generation – with their knowledge and talent – can stay and build a future.”",https://www.krsl.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/_images/2023-04/Laura-Kelly.jpg?itok=XRVp2_-5,N,,2025-07-14 10:12:45.893985

These Energy Resilience Hubs will be located in Castañer, Lares; La Perla, San Juan; Quebrada Arenas, Caguas; Rubias, Yauco; and San Diego, Coamo. Owned by the communities, the Hubs will allow some of Puerto Rico’s most vulnerable areas to have access to reliable electricity during, before, and after an extreme weather event or other disaster that affects the electrical grid.

The Hubs are being developed in partnership with IREC, a national nonprofit organization that supports the rapid adoption of clean energy. IREC will facilitate the development of these Centers in collaboration with the five communities and with the support of the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus.

Planta Solar is a Puerto Rico-based company that has been installing solar energy and storage systems in community centers, residences, public facilities and businesses across Puerto Rico since 2016. The community facilities will have the capacity to maintain electricity for essential services in the event of a power outage.

For IREC, these projects are part of a long-term commitment to facilitate the growth of sustainable energy in Puerto Rico. Last year, IREC and its partners installed the first five Energy Resilience Hubs in Calabazas Arriba, Yabucoa; La Calle Abajo y Sus Vecinos, Lajas; Cubuy, Canóvanas; Guayabota, Yabucoa; and Villa Esperanza, Toa Alta.

“Community Energy Resilience Hubs must be a part of the infrastructure for vulnerable communities in Puerto Rico,” said Carlos Velázquez, IREC Program Director in Puerto Rico. “For the IREC team, it has been a privilege to work on this energy resilience project with the Department of Energy, the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez Campus, and local photovoltaic companies to positively impact the quality of life in 10 communities across Puerto Rico. We trust that this work is a roadmap for replication in hundreds of other communities in need.”

Planta Solar was selected by a committee that included IREC and UPR-M team members along with representatives from the five communities. The review committee highlighted that the Planta Solar’s experience, installation schedule and robust proposal for the operation and maintenance of the systems stood out among a highly competitive group of over 15 applicant companies.

The Energy Resilience Hubs are funded by a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Dept. of Energy. IREC hopes to collaborate with Planta Solar to complete the installations by September 2025.

Tiscapa, like its sister ships in the Avance Class, consists of container capacity for 1,400 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units), including 300 refrigerated units. The ship was designed to quickly deliver cargo while using lower emission LNG for fuel, compared to diesel or other refined fossil fuels.

Earlier this year, Crowley began delivering U.S. LNG aboard its American Energy vessel to Puerto Rico. LNG is natural gas chilled to minus 260 Fahrenheit to liquify it, de-compress it and make it stable for shipping.

The latest vessel, Tiscapa, departed from the Port of Jacksonville, Florida, for its commercial voyage serving the Caribbean Basin. After a transition period of service for the region, Tiscapa will start offering regular service between the U.S., Dominican Republic and Central America, presenting direct market connections for goods such as medical devices, household goods, food and perishables.

""The addition of Tiscapa to our fleet marks another milestone in Crowley's commitment to delivering efficient and reliable logistics solutions across the region,"" said Andrew Davis, vice president of operations for Crowley Logistics. ""With its LNG-powered design and expanded capacity for dry and refrigerated goods, Tiscapa enhances our ability to provide faster, dependable service for customers moving essential goods throughout the U.S. and Caribbean Basin.""

Musallet's family said his killing is ""an unimaginable nightmare and an injustice that no family should ever have to face.""
""Not even a word of condolence offered to his family, not from 'America First' President Trump, not from the Florida governor, not from the State Department,"" she said.
He just fired the last remaining State Department employees who work on climate change, which is undoubtedly one of the greatest threats to our national security,"" said Sanders.","The family described how Israeli settlers ""surrounded Saif for over three hours as paramedics attempted to reach him, but the mob of settlers blocked the ambulance and paramedics from providing life-saving aid.""

Musallet's brother finally was able to retrieve him and bring him to a nearby hospital, but he died from his injuries before arriving there.

The State Department has said little about the killing of Musallet, who was a 20-year-old Palestinian-American with dual citizenship who was born in Florida, where he was still living when he traveled to the West Bank to visit family for the summer.

The Trump administration told Al Jazeera late Friday that the department ""has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas,"" and said it was ""aware of reports of the death of a U.S. citizen in the West Bank,"" but did not provide further details about how it was proceeding following Musallet's killing.

Meanwhile, rights advocates condemned The New York Times' reporting on the attack, which it called ""a clash."" It cited the Israeli government's claim that ""the violence began when Palestinians threw stones at Israeli civilians.""

""This was a lynching, not a 'clash,'"" said Imraan Siddiqi, executive director of the Washington State office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).

Musallet is at least the ninth U.S. citizen to be killed by Israeli forces or settlers since 2022. The U.S. government has historically accepted the results of Israel's investigations into killings like those of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi.

Under pressure, the Department of Justice finally opened a probe into the 2022 fatal shooting of Abu Akleh, but more than three years after her killing it has not released its findings.

None of the Israeli killings of U.S. citizens have resulted in criminal charges.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee told Al Jazeera Saturday that the U.S. ""must stop treating Palestinian American lives as expendable.""

""Israeli settlers lynched 20-year-old Palestinian American Sayfollah Musallet, while U.S. officials stayed silent,"" the group said. ""Sayfollah was born and raised in Florida. He was visiting family for the summer in the West Bank when settlers beat him to death while he protested illegal land seizures.""

Musallet's family said his killing is ""an unimaginable nightmare and an injustice that no family should ever have to face.""

""We demand justice,"" they said.

Zeteo journalist Mehdi Hasan noted that along with the Trump administration near-silence, Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has so far said nothing publicly about the killing of the Tampa resident.

""Why do Israelis keep murdering Americans?"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now. ""Perhaps it's because they know our government will never do a damn thing about it?""

""Not even a word of condolence offered to his family, not from 'America First' President Trump, not from the Florida governor, not from the State Department,"" she said. ""Seems it's always just really Israel First for these folks.""

""Yet again we're seeing horrific reports of the killing of seven children in Gaza, this time as they were waiting for water at a distribution site,"" said Catherine Russell, executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund. ""This comes just days after several children and women were killed waiting for nutritional supplies.""

""The Israeli authorities must urgently review the rules of engagement and ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law, notably the protection of civilians, including children,"" Russell added. ""UNICEF calls for an immediate and lasting cease-fire, aid at scale, and release of hostages.""

The Israeli military acknowledged that it carried out the attack but denied it was trying to hit the water distribution point, claiming that a ""technical error"" caused the missile to miss its purported target—an Islamic Jihad militant—by dozens of meters.

Gaza's Government Media Office said in a statement early Monday that Israeli forces have killed more than 700 people in more than 100 attacks on water distribution sites since October 2023. The media office also said the Israeli government has prevented 12 million liters of fuel from entering the enclave per month, ""the minimum amount needed to operate water wells, sewage treatment plants, waste collection vehicles, and other vital sectors.""

""The Gaza Strip is today witnessing a major crime of deprivation of water, perpetrated deliberately and systematically by the Israeli occupation, amidst complete international silence and the direct and indirect participation of European and Western countries implicated in supporting or complicit in the crime of genocide,"" the office said.

Leading humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Human Rights Watch (HRW), have also accused the Israeli government of using water as a weapon of war in the Gaza Strip by cutting off supply and decimating the enclave's existing infrastructure, including wells and desalination plants.

The International Rescue Committee said last week that Gaza's ""entire water system has broken down"" and warned that ""there is simply not enough clean water to meet the needs of the population in Gaza.""

""When clean water is unavailable, the consequences extend far beyond thirst; families are forced to rely on unsafe water sources for cooking, cleaning, and bathing, heightening the risk of disease outbreaks like skin conditions, diarrhea, and hepatitis,"" the group said. ""This compounds the burden on Gaza's collapsing health system, particularly in overcrowded shelters with limited hygiene options.""

Israeli forces have also been massacring civilians at food distribution sites in recent weeks as famine spreads throughout Gaza.

The United Nations said on Friday that it recorded 798 killings at food distribution locations in Gaza between May 27 and July 7, with the overwhelming majority occurring in the vicinity of sites managed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

""They have a choice between being shot or being fed,"" said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Office.

Grist's Kate Yoder wrote Monday that ""this isn't climate denial in the traditional sense.""

""The days of loudly debating the science have mostly given way to something quieter and more insidious: a campaign to withhold the raw information itself,"" Yoder added.

Sanders' statement came days after the U.S. State Department fired all employees still at the Office of Global Change, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio is moving to eliminate at Trump's behest. Most of the office's staffers, who were tasked with engaging in international climate negotiations, had already departed voluntarily amid Trump's sweeping withdrawal from global climate initiatives and talks.

Sanders highlighted the context of Trump's assault on climate science and diplomacy, pointing to ""flooding in Texas this past week and in Vermont and Brazil last summer, recent wildfires in Canada and Los Angeles, and heatwaves in the United States, Europe, India, and Pakistan""—extreme weather made more intense by fossil fuel-driven climate change.

""The past 10 years have been the warmest 10 years on record,"" the senator noted. ""2024 was the warmest year in recorded history. January 2025 was the hottest January on record. Western Europe just had its hottest June on record. The recent heatwave in the United States put nearly 190 million Americans under heat advisories and broke heat records in more than 280 locations. Over the past 60 years, the frequency of heatwaves in the United States has tripled. According to a new study from Yale University, 64% of Americans think global warming is affecting the weather in the U.S. and almost half say they have personally experienced its effects.""

""And what is President Trump's response? He just fired the last remaining State Department employees who work on climate change, which is undoubtedly one of the greatest threats to our national security,"" said Sanders.

While removing federal climate staffers and experts en masse, Trump's administration has hired prominent climate denialists and moved to expand planet-warming oil and gas drilling—a gift to the fossil fuel giants that poured nearly $20 million into the president's inaugural fund and helped bankroll his White House campaign.

""Every month that Donald Trump has been in power, we've seen a raft of anti-climate measures come out which are music to the fossil fuel industry's ears,"" said Nicu Calcea, senior data investigator at Global Witness. ""From plans to steamroll through dirty new coal plants, to the attempted quashing of 'polluter pays' laws that would hold oil giants accountable, it's clear where his political priorities lie.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMjEwMDM4OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxMjIyMDI1N30.ErOfRE5hvYF7nWXKN4iUp2dOTKR2-o5weET2FxMgj9A/image.png?width=210,N,,2025-07-14 12:37:47.878894

Headwinds for Renewable Energies The applicable tax credits are curtailed for wind and solar projects.
In essence the government pays the oil industry more to bury CO2 emissions, that come from burning oil, in a process that produces more oil to be burned.
There are direct policy benefits for the oil and gas industry, as discussed above, and these are expected from a “drill, baby, drill” mantra.","Energy policy in the U.S. has changed dramatically since OBBBA (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) has been signed into law. This will affect energy markets significantly. In some cases, tax credits will disappear sooner. In other cases, imports from countries like China may be restricted. The uncertainty of U.S. policies from one four-year government to the next will destabilize some 20-30 year deals. Will the oil and gas industry thrive or dive? A survey of key issues provides some answers.

An insightful assessment of policy changes by the OBBBA has been documented by Wood Mackenzie. Let’s take a look at the consequences, especially for the oil and gas industry.

Headwinds for Renewable Energies

The applicable tax credits are curtailed for wind and solar projects. 10-year installations could fall by 17% for solar and 20% for wind. It might be worse because compliance restrictions may hurt Chinese-supported manufacturers.

Handicapping certain green projects in this way is hard to understand because in the U.S. over 90% of new energy projects in 2023 and 2024 was generated by solar, wind, and batteries. At-risk projects could amount to several hundred GW (gigawatts), with the largest of such projects in California, Texas, and central U.S.

The biggest losses may be, first, soaring electricity costs in the U.S., because renewables have dominated new sources of power in the last couple of years. The second loss is the U.S. ignoring China’s surging solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS) that will reliably service their AI data center programs—meaning the U.S. may lose the AI race.

Could green projects that lost their tax credits go ahead to completion? They might, but it’s obvious this would translate to higher cost of electricity for consumers. The only commercially proven competitor is gas-fired power plants, which are facing serious delays, and they cost more.

Battery Energy Storage

Battery energy storage systems are booming in Australia, where renewable electricity in one state is running at 75% of total. The U.S. and the rest of the world are catching up on the use of BESS to stabilize solar and wind power. China is bidding record low prices for new BESS, which is the key to making solar PV and wind a dispatchable source of electricity—at the lowest price for new build systems.

The OBBBA will maintain tax credits through 2030, which is good because data centers for AI and other interests will require a massive increase in electricity in the U.S., starting now. But BESS still faces Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions that could prevent the U.S. from buying Chinese battery cells.

Electric Vehicles Lose Tax Credits Soon

The best time to buy an EV is now, because tax incentives run out on September 30, 2025 (they would have lasted another seven years under the previous administration). Wood Mackenzie predict that the market for EVs will drop in 2030 from 23% to 18%. Companies that sell EVs made in the U.S., such as Tesla, will suffer, and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will remain higher.

Dropping the tax credit on EVs is one way the Trump administration is supporting the oil and gas industry, when crude oil is down to $60. Despite this, demand for crude oil will eventually fall as cars and trucks switch to EVs and gasoline/diesel usage drops. Some observers are predicting peak oil is imminent in the mighty Permian basin, and in the whole world by 2030. After peak oil, the demand for crude falls, albeit slowly.

Emerging Technologies Show A Mix Of Results

Nuclear and geothermal retain the support provided by the previous Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, with a couple of upgrades. First, funding for small nuclear reactors (SMR) will be revised. This will be necessary since recent reports show that SMRs, now and through 2030, are significantly more expensive than renewable energies. Second, annual lease sales have been mandated by the OBBBA, and this should accelerate investments in next-gen geothermal energy.

But with tax credits based on utility scale projects, solar PV plus BESS and wind plus BESS are cheaper than geothermal with tax credits, and much cheaper than nuclear (and gas-fired or coal-powered units). Since the OBBBA handicaps wind and solar in the energy race, electricity costs from nuclear and geothermal will move upwards.

Carbon Capture And Storage (CCUS)

This technique gets a boost because it’s connected to oil production. Previously there were two levels of tax credits: a higher level if injection of greenhouse gases like CO2 was not used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and a lower level if it was. The OBBBA has raised the lower level to the higher level, which benefits the oil and gas industry. In essence the government pays the oil industry more to bury CO2 emissions, that come from burning oil, in a process that produces more oil to be burned. It’s a win for oil production, but not for greenhouse gas emissions.

The OBBBA will benefit a company like ExxonMobil that already has about 20 working CCUS injection projects.

Big Win For Upstream Sector

The survey report listed several direct benefits of OBBBA to the oil and gas industry, including the following. First, leasing and royalty issues are being changed. There will be quarterly lease sales mandated in nine western states. Also, royalty rates will be reduced from 16.7% to 12.5%. But are oil companies prepared to drill more wells when the price of oil hovers above $60 per barrel? Since the drop on June 24, WTI prices have risen slowly from $64 to $68. But companies have been in a period of increasing capex efficiency, and are wary of starting new drilling programs. A recent survey by the Dallas Federal Reserve indicated a general tightening due to oil price, cost of steel pipes, tariff uncertainty, and produced water woes in the Permian basin.

Second is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which as expected will be opened to competitive leasing.

Third is tax benefits for oil and gas companies. The new bill allows full deduction of intangible drilling costs, and extends a bonus depreciation (described as massive) to production real property through 2031.

What does all this mean? There are direct policy benefits for the oil and gas industry, as discussed above, and these are expected from a “drill, baby, drill” mantra. But the indirect benefits seem to reflect a posture against green energy, related to unbelief in climate change, and these lead to support for inefficient energy alternatives like nuclear and geothermal and gas-fired turbines. This policy will lead to more expensive electricity in the U.S. and a serious delay in the race against China for AI dominance.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6875015b3833d6460acda11e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-14 10:12:55.074562

The study, which mapped 78 flood events across roughly three-quarters of the state, fills a major gap in understanding the full impacts of flooding on communities well beyond the state's coastal floodplains.

Until now, detailed flood maps have existed for only a handful of past events. The research team created high-resolution maps for more than 70 previously unmapped floods, linking them to the exact locations of buildings.

Their findings show that over 90,000 buildings flooded in at least one event, with 43% of them located outside of FEMA's designated 100-year floodplains, areas officially recognized as high-risk.

""We found that flooding in North Carolina, especially repetitive flooding, is more widespread and frequent than we previously knew, and it is often happening outside of places we currently consider as high-risk,"" said Helena Garcia, lead author of the Earth's Future study and a Ph.D. candidate in the Environment, Ecology, and Energy Program at UNC-Chapel Hill.

While previous studies and government data have focused on large, headline-grabbing storms like Hurricane Florence or only on insured properties, this study breaks new ground by capturing a much broader and more nuanced view. FEMA's records count roughly 13,000 repetitively flooded properties in the entire state since the 1970s.

In contrast, the Carolina team identified more than 20,000 repeatedly flooded buildings from just 1996 to 2020 in a portion of the state where many of these buildings were not covered by flood insurance, meaning they would not have been tracked by insurance records at all.

""We've always known flooding is a threat to NC, but the focus has been on only the biggest events. With this study, we're painting a much more complete picture. There are lots of floods that go under the radar and don't make the headlines, but they are just as damaging and disruptive to the families that are impacted,"" said Antonia Sebastian, lead advisor and assistant professor in UNC-Chapel Hill's Environment, Ecology, and Energy Program and Department of Earth, Marine, and Environmental Sciences.

The implications of the research are both practical and urgent. By identifying where repetitive flooding has already occurred, the data can help guide smarter, more equitable resilience investments, whether that means strengthening infrastructure, updating emergency planning, or offering better support to affected communities.

""These findings can help guide more effective resilience investments by identifying communities that have been hit hard by flooding but may currently be overlooked by government programs and policies,"" said Miyuki Hino, co-author and assistant professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning and the Environment, Ecology, and Energy Program.

Their work is already laying the groundwork for further studies on how flooding affects residents over time, from financial strain to health outcomes to migration patterns.

BRASÍLIA (DF) – The chair of the Environment Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, deputy Socorro Neri (PP-AC), pledged to take to the House speaker, Hugo Motta (Republicans-PB), a request from environmental organizations to postpone by 90 days the vote on the General Environmental Licensing Bill (PL 2159/2021), which is currently scheduled for consideration by the full House next week—the last before the mid-year parliamentary recess.

Dubbed the “Devastation Bill” by environmentalists, the proposal has been under discussion in the National Congress for 15 years and spent four years in the Senate, where it received 32 amendments. These Senate changes must now be reviewed by federal deputies, who can either approve or reject them. The bill faces strong opposition from the environmental sector for weakening key licensing rules, but it has backing from the productive sector, which sees the bill as essential to unlocking the country’s development.

The request for a postponement came from Caio Magri, CEO of the Ethos Institute for Business and Social Responsibility, during a public hearing held by the committee on Thursday to discuss the risks and impacts of the licensing bill. Magri stated that he would send the request to House Speaker Hugo Motta (Republicans-PB), urging at least 90 days for debate on the Senate’s amendments, which have not been properly discussed with society.

Appointed as the bill’s rapporteur, deputy Zé Vitor (PL-MG) has already issued a preliminary report, whose main change was the rejection of a Senate amendment that removed a provision requiring compliance with rules defined by the National Environmental Council (Conama) for licensing large-scale mining projects. In the version previously passed by the House, deputies had already excluded mining from the bill.

In calling for the postponement, Caio Magri outlined at least seven reasons, including the need for more time to discuss the changes approved in the Senate, which will have direct impacts on Brazil’s biomes, and the risk they pose to international environmental commitments made by Brazil, many of which are being debated at the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), scheduled for November in Belém.

At the close of the public hearing, which included several representatives from civil society and the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MMA), deputy Socorro Neri said she would make every effort to seek the postponement from Hugo Motta, though she acknowledged the challenge, given that the legislative agenda is set by the college of leaders.

According to Agência Câmara, the government leader in the House, deputy José Guimarães (PT-CE), stated that the Executive Branch will negotiate points of consensus to pass the bill in alignment with the guidance of Environment Minister Marina Silva.

“This will force us to work toward an agreement. We’re in talks with Minister Marina, and nothing will be voted on without her approval. We’ll talk, we’ll try to reach common ground with the rapporteur, deputy Zé Vitor, who’s been open to negotiating, and the talks have already made significant progress,” Guimarães said.

More than 20 years in the making

PL 2159/2021 was originally introduced under the number 3729 in 2004 and was archived and reintroduced three times by the Board of the Chamber of Deputies, most recently in 2019. The bill was only passed by the House floor on May 13, 2021, with 290 votes in favor and 115 against, and was then sent to the Senate.

The new version with 32 amendments returned to the Chamber on May 26 of this year. Two days later, deputy Socorro Neri submitted the request to hold a public hearing in the Environment Committee, which was only held on Thursday, July 10, after the report by Zé Vitor had already been submitted.

The proposal was approved under an urgency regime, allowing it to be considered directly by the full House—a vote expected to take place next week, according to the decision made by the college of leaders.

Government expresses deep concern

At Thursday’s public hearing, federal government representatives voiced deep concern over the text that will be voted on in the Chamber, warning of irreversible damage that could lead to the judicialization of the Licensing Bill.

One of the officials who raised these concerns was João Paulo Capobianco, Executive Secretary of the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MMA). He identified 40 provisions in the bill that must be corrected by the deputies.

“There are various provisions that need to be amended to prevent what would be irreversible harm to the environmental protection system. We are working intensively within the government, under the leadership of the Civil House and directly minister Rui Costa, to produce a result that is not so impactful and harmful to the Brazilian environmental system,” he said.

Capobianco specifically highlighted the risks of weakening the National Environment System (Sisnama) and the implementation of the “License by Adhesion and Commitment” (LAC), which would establish self-licensing with sampling-based inspections, and would extend to medium-scale projects that are currently subject to the three-phase environmental licensing model (preliminary, installation, and operation licenses).

There is also concern about weakening the National System of Conservation Units, the Atlantic Forest Law—a major achievement in protecting that biome—and the removal of the requirement for prior consultation with Indigenous peoples, quilombolas, and other traditional communities in licensing processes that affect their territories.

The president of Ibama, Rodrigo Agostinho, stated that the agency is currently processing 4,140 environmental licensing cases in the areas of transportation, mining, power transmission lines, hydroelectric plants, and oil and gas projects. According to him, the text now in the House floor cannot be corrected, since only the Senate amendments will be considered. This increases the risk of legal challenges if it is approved, as environmental licensing is a constitutional matter.

Threat level: U.S. EV sales growth was slowing even before the new federal law.
""You've ... got to give people the opportunity to touch electric vehicles, get in an electric vehicle, take a ride and drive, because that's where you really start getting the 'aha moment' when people's faces light up and they get excited about electric vehicles,"" Boone said.","Electric vehicle advocates on Monday are launching a $43.5 million campaign that touts EVs' benefits — and has a star pitchman in actor Nick Offerman.

Why it matters: The nonprofit EV group Veloz's effort lands as the new budget law ends federal consumer tax credits this fall and Trump 2.0 dismantles other Biden-era EV policies.

The advertising and public awareness push, funded by charging network Electrify America, marks a major effort by Veloz to expand its work beyond California.

""Electric for All"" is the ""first and largest nonprofit-led EV education campaign in the U.S.,"" an announcement to be released Monday states.

The big picture: Veloz executive director Josh D. Boone tells Axios exclusively there's no direct tie to the recent legislation, noting Veloz has eyed going national since its launch almost nine years ago.

But he said it's ""good timing"" because ""more Americans are interested in EVs than ever"" and need factual info.

He said Veloz is encouraging people to tap federal incentives before they vanish.

But it's also highlighting local and state incentives that remain, and more broadly making the case for moving from gasoline to electrons.

""They have long-term benefits beyond just getting a federal tax credit,"" Boone said in an interview.

""There's cost savings from gas. There's total cost of ownership — they're just cheaper to own and operate and fuel than gas vehicles,"" he said.

How it works: It's a 50-state campaign that targets people seeking their next vehicles within six months to two years, Boone said.

It includes TV, radio, search results, podcasts, social media and more, and it's aimed at buyers across income levels.

The spots steer people toward a multilingual Veloz site that helps them find incentives and browse models, among other features.

Zoom in: One spot shows the deconstruction of a gas-powered engine with the overlay of Offerman's voice making the case for EVs.

""When you take away the spark plugs, the oil filter, belts, the alternator, and, oh yeah, the gas tank, you tend to take away other stuff, like headaches,"" he says.

""EVs have fewer parts, fewer repairs and are less expensive to drive,"" adds the comedian, best known as the irascible Ron Swanson of ""Parks and Recreation.""

Threat level: U.S. EV sales growth was slowing even before the new federal law.

EVs (including plug-in hybrids) were 9.6% of light-duty sales in Q1, per the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto trade group.

Q1 sales commonly drop from Q4, but the 1.3% decline was steeper than prior dips, the group's latest report states.

Flashback: Volkswagen created Electrify America in 2017 under the settlement of its diesel emissions cheating scandal.

It agreed to invest $2 billion over 10 years in infrastructure, access, and education initiatives.

The intrigue: The Veloz campaign will feature in-person events.

""You've ... got to give people the opportunity to touch electric vehicles, get in an electric vehicle, take a ride and drive, because that's where you really start getting the 'aha moment' when people's faces light up and they get excited about electric vehicles,"" Boone said.

It compares projected energy costs in 2035 under two scenarios: one where Trump's budget bill passed, and one where it didn't.","Electricity prices are expected to surge higher throughout the next decade due to energy policy changes in President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful"" bill, according to a new analysis from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate think tank.

Signed July 4, the bill mandates expanded oil and gas leasing, caps clean energy subsidies and rolls back tax credits that helped to make wind, solar and other clean power cheaper for manufacturers and more affordable for consumers, says Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation.

When the clean energy tax credits phase out at the end of 2025, that will bump up electricity costs for ordinary Americans, Orvis says.

That's largely because higher costs for clean energy development will slow the pace of new supply, just as U.S. energy demand hits record highs, he says, resulting in higher electricity bills and increased reliance on natural gas, which will also become more expensive with rising demand.

How much energy costs could increase

Electricity costs in some states will go up more than others due to the budget bill's provisions, Orvis says — particularly in states with the greatest future potential for clean energy development.

Oklahoma's windy conditions, for example, make the state a prime candidate for powering wind turbines, which has historically allowed residents to benefit from cheap, clean energy, Orvis says. But without the tax break for new wind power infrastructure, the average household electricity bill in the state will rise by $540 by 2035, according to Energy Innovation's analysis.

Money Report

Overall, household energy costs will rise by $170, on average, by 2035, researchers found. And that estimate may be conservative. A report from Princeton University's Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit pegs the average increase at $280 a year by 2035.

What's driving the price hikes

Energy Innovation's report factors in the near dozen Biden-era clean energy incentives that Trump's legislation terminates or phases out, along with a few clean energy policies the bill affects that predated former President Joe Biden's administration, Energy Innovation says. It compares projected energy costs in 2035 under two scenarios: one where Trump's budget bill passed, and one where it didn't.

The data accounts for changes in spending on all fuel types for powering homes and vehicles, including natural gas and gasoline, although most of the cost increases are related to electricity and natural gas, Energy Innovation says. The report did not include Alaska or Hawaii.

Here's how much more households in every state could pay annually, on average, by 2035, due to changes in energy policies under the ""big beautiful"" bill, according to Energy Innovation's research.

Signed July 4, the bill mandates expanded oil and gas leasing, caps clean energy subsidies and rolls back tax credits that helped to make wind, solar and other clean power cheaper for manufacturers and more affordable for consumers, says Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation.

When the clean energy tax credits phase out at the end of 2025, that will bump up electricity costs for ordinary Americans, Orvis says.

That's largely because higher costs for clean energy development will slow the pace of new supply, just as U.S. energy demand hits record highs, he says, resulting in higher electricity bills and increased reliance on natural gas, which will also become more expensive with rising demand.

How much energy costs could increase

Electricity costs in some states will go up more than others due to the budget bill's provisions, Orvis says — particularly in states with the greatest future potential for clean energy development.

Oklahoma's windy conditions, for example, make the state a prime candidate for powering wind turbines, which has historically allowed residents to benefit from cheap, clean energy, Orvis says. But without the tax break for new wind power infrastructure, the average household electricity bill in the state will rise by $540 by 2035, according to Energy Innovation's analysis.

Money Report

Overall, household energy costs will rise by $170, on average, by 2035, researchers found. And that estimate may be conservative. A report from Princeton University's Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit pegs the average increase at $280 a year by 2035.

The power of policy Continuing this impressive upward trajectory of wind power will require backing from government policies and international agreements.
Effective legislation should create a supportive environment and reduce risks for investment, innovation and market expansion in the wind energy sector.
Software platforms must enable rapid configuration and integrate with reporting obligations, approval processes, and regional grid codes.
Looking ahead Wind energy is a huge success story in the renewable revolution, but the journey doesn’t stop here.","There’s an old Chinese proverb that says “when the winds of change blow, some build walls, others build windmills.” In a modern and evolving energy industry, those who build windmills are leading the green transition. Here, Stefan Hufnagl, Industry Specialist Energy at automation supplier COPA-DATA, discusses the growing importance of wind power and the necessary factors to drive its success.

Global energy trends show that we are making huge strides in harnessing these winds of change. Wind power has become a fundamental pillar of the world’s energy mix, generating over 2,300 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity each year as of 2023, or around 10 per cent of the world’s total supply.

But meeting soaring global energy demand and supporting ambitious climate targets will call for more than turbines alone. Building on the rapid uptake of wind power will require a broad, multifaceted approach that brings together effective policy and smart technology. From predictive maintenance to centralized control platforms, digital innovation will drive wind energy’s next chapter.

Over 40 countries are actively investing in wind, with China, the UK and Germany leading the charge. Onshore wind farms still account for most of this capacity. This segment is worth $130 billion as of 2023 and could be on track to hit a staggering $200 billion by 2030 if growth continues at its current rate.

That said, offshore wind is gaining momentum fast. The surge of offshore wind projects is also partly due to declining availability of suitable land for onshore projects, but also because new innovations are making it easier and more cost effective to capture wind out at sea. What’s more, turbines are growing in both size and capacity, with newer units exceeding 1 MW, and floating wind platforms are now more easily deployable, harvesting energy in previously inaccessible areas.

In fact, the offshore wind sector, with a current value of $40 billion, is projected to triple to over $100 billion in the same 2023 to 2030 period. Achieving growth at this scale will depend heavily on both policy support and integration of smart digital solutions.

The power of policy

Continuing this impressive upward trajectory of wind power will require backing from government policies and international agreements. Incentivizing green energy through government-established objectives, tax credits and financial subsidies is necessary to encourage the development of further projects. Several nations already offer feed-in tariffs (FiTs) and power purchase agreements (PPAs) to guarantee that wind energy providers are paid fairly for the energy they produce.

Effective legislation should create a supportive environment and reduce risks for investment, innovation and market expansion in the wind energy sector. Policies that fund R&D will pave the way for next-generation tech and infrastructure. But legislation alone can’t ensure success — it must be combined with intelligent software systems.

As regulations vary globally, operators need tools that can adapt to different policy environments. Software platforms must enable rapid configuration and integrate with reporting obligations, approval processes, and regional grid codes. Success depends on simple, configurable functions and customizable interfaces, empowering energy companies to align with local regulation without slowing operations.

Infrastructure meets innovation

Expanding wind power capacity poses unique technical challenges, from the natural volatility of renewable resources to the difficulty of integrating modern digital solutions with legacy infrastructure. Staying competitive in the sector requires more than installing turbines; it depends on strategic use of intelligent, interoperable technologies.

To get the most out of wind power projects, digital infrastructure should be viewed as an essential component of scalability, efficiency and resilience across the whole life cycle of a wind project rather than simply a helpful supporting feature. As fleets expand, especially offshore, operators face increasing technological heterogeneity. Assets from multiple OEMs come with different software interfaces, data standards and maintenance protocols, making streamlined operations fragmented, more complex and costly.

Platforms like COPA-DATA’s zenon address this by providing a unified, vendor-agnostic control environment. They integrate assets across hardware types, operational domains and generations, enabling centralized monitoring, automation and data analysis — creating the interconnectedness needed for scalable and profitable operations.

Wind farms also rely on seamless coordination between complex systems: turbines, substations, monitoring systems and grids. Without unification, data silos and disjointed systems limit performance. Smart platforms harmonize data across these systems, improving situational awareness and ensuring compliance with changing regulations.

These platforms are built to handle vast volumes of operational data from distributed assets. zenon, for instance, enables centralized control and monitoring for visibility across multiple sites, turning complex data into actionable insights to keep operations smooth and predictable.

Predictive power

The shift towards predictive maintenance strategies further highlights how fundamental intelligent software systems are becoming across the energy sector. By using sensors, predictive analytics and automated event logging, operators can move from reactive troubleshooting to intuitive, proactive asset management.

This allows for the detection of early signs of equipment stress, preventing costly downtime. In an industry where asset availability directly impacts profitability, this protects energy output and lowers the long-term lifecycle costs, turning maintenance excellence into a competitive advantage.

Predictive maintenance is just one example of how data transforms wind operations. By analyzing long-term production trends alongside environmental conditions, operators can identify underperformance or degradation, schedule inspection windows and maintain high availability — all of which are essential for profitability and regulatory compliance.

Adaptive control systems also play a role in managing the intermittency of wind which often results in energy spikes or uneven loads. These systems adjust turbine output in real time, balancing power production with grid demands and protecting equipment from overstrain.

As wind encompasses a larger share of the grid, these systems are vital for stability. Future-proof automation must balance technical, commercial, and regulatory needs. With platforms like zenon, operators can bridge the gap between plant performance and grid integration. Together, these technologies create an agile, connected operation able to stay ahead in a fast-growing industry.

Looking ahead

Wind energy is a huge success story in the renewable revolution, but the journey doesn’t stop here. Meeting both future energy needs and climate targets will require not only more turbines, but smarter, more connected systems.

The future of wind will rely on sustained investment in infrastructure, innovation and digital tools. With effective policy, advanced technology and global collaboration, we can keep building windmills to harness the winds of change for a cleaner, more secure future.

The organization hopes to power nearly all of the new building’s electricity needs with solar energy.
“That’s a tax credit that is really beneficial for clean energy projects like solar,” Zegas said.
Those solar projects will benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities who rely on multifamily affordable housing projects, similar to the residents at The Empowerment Center.
Community solar projects can be hosted by local governments, schools, businesses, or nonprofit that have a building, carport, or other land where solar can be placed.","A new sober living facility in Reno was selected as one of the first in the nation to receive federal funding for rooftop solar development under a Biden-era program that was nearly canceled by the Trump administration earlier this year.

The Empowerment Center – a nonprofit offering affordable housing for low income and at-risk women recovering from substance abuse – will receive more than $960,000 in “Solar for All” funding to install solar at their newly constructed multi-unit housing property.

Last year, Nevada was awarded a $156 million “Solar for All” grant by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support rooftop or community solar projects that benefit low-income households.

Nevada was one of several states cut off from the funding after President Donald Trump called for the immediate halt of energy grants, loans, and contracts funded through the Inflation Reduction Act passed under former president Joe Biden.

The Solar for All program was the only grant under the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to survive the cull. In March EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of the fund’s other two federal grants, eliminating $20 billion in renewable energy investment.

With the survival of the program, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank that administers the “Solar for All” funds — selected the sober living facility as the first project to get the green-light.

“This first-of-its-kind project demonstrates how clean energy can help uplift people working hard to restore their lives,” said Kirsten Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.

Roxanne DeCarlo, the executive director of The Empowerment Center, said the solar installation will be vital to reducing utility costs and helping free up funds for addiction treatment, case management, and support staff.

“When individuals arrive at our program, they are unemployed, homeless, or were recently incarcerated, so we’re really working with individuals that have a very low income. It’s really important that we keep our operations cost as low as possible,” DeCarlo said.

Solar has already proven to be a significant cost-saving measure at the nonprofit’s two other affordable housing facilities, said DeCarlo. The organization hopes to power nearly all of the new building’s electricity needs with solar energy.

Nevada received the highest “Solar for All” funding per capita of any state. In fact, Nevada received the same award amount as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania — states with significantly higher populations.

With robust funding, Nevada’s “Solar for All” program was expected to boost development of rooftop and community solar for low-income households that don’t have access to solar energy due to high upfront installation costs.

But the future of the program has also grown increasingly uncertain after Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, cutting the 30% Clean Electricity Investment Credit for solar projects that start construction after July 4, 2026 — phasing it out six years ahead of schedule. Projects will also need to be in service by the end of 2027 to receive the full credit.

For residential solar, the 30% credit ends entirely at the end of 2025.

Greg Zegas, the managing director of investments at the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said the early termination of tax credits pressures solar project developers to start construction before the end of the year. The deadline particularly impacts working families who rely on the tax credit to make solar affordable as electricity prices continue to climb.

“That’s a tax credit that is really beneficial for clean energy projects like solar,” Zegas said. “It basically means that any project that’s starting construction after 2025 is going to face additional hurdles for claiming the full value of the tax credit.”

In order to fill the funding gap left by the dissolution of those credits, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund may need to cover more solar installation costs in the state while funding less projects.

“If we’re putting more money out towards grants, then it would reduce the amount of funding that we have for projects,” Zegas said.

Despite a tight deadline and other challenges, Zegas said the Nevada Clean Energy Fund is optimistic they can get the $156 million allocated to Nevada “out the door to benefit households across the state.”

In the next few weeks, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund plans to finalize funding for several other “Solar for All” projects, said Zegas.

Those solar projects will benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities who rely on multifamily affordable housing projects, similar to the residents at The Empowerment Center.

Community solar projects can be hosted by local governments, schools, businesses, or nonprofit that have a building, carport, or other land where solar can be placed.

“This program is really focused on benefiting low-income communities. Those populations face the highest utility bill burden proportionate to their income. That’s our goal with these projects, to reduce those energy costs and share those savings for households,” Zegas said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/marvel-exterior-1-635x425-11752494975.jpg?h=848e5ac8&itok=LDiiHwOM,N,,2025-07-14 12:34:35.189227

The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row.
In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.
In some ways, Trump’s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats and Republicans don’t agree on much, but they share a conviction that the government should help American manufacturers, one way or another.

Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers. Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes — tariffs — around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.

The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.

The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.

“The past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,’’ said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. “We didn’t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we’ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.’’

Big economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.

Government policy was meant to help.

Biden’s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom – investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 – that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.

But the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden’s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, “manufacturing production will continue to flatline.”

“If production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,” Zandi said. “Manufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.’’

Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers — and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America — by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.

In some ways, Trump’s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But “when you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,’’ Zuzick said. “So that’s definitely a situation where it’s beneficial.’’

But American factories import and use foreign products, too – machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.

Consider steel. Trump’s tariffs don’t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices – and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.

In fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France — and pay Trump’s tariff.

Trump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.

The flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: “Customers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,’’ a fabricated metal products company said.

“Tariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,’’ added a computer and electronics firm. “The situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.’’

Some may argue that things aren’t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they’ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.

Factories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.

Suddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off – and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 — the most since 1994 — and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.

But in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.

In the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.

“It’s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,’’ said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden’s White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products said that it will take time to see if Trump’s tariffs succeed in bringing factories back to America.

“The fact is that manufacturing doesn’t turn on a dime,’’ he said. “It takes time to switch gears.’’

Hagopian at Pilot Precision is hopeful that tax breaks in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will help American manufacturing regain momentum.

“There may be light at the end of the tunnel that may not be a locomotive bearing down,’’ he said.

For now, manufacturers are likely to delay big decisions on investing or bringing on new workers until they see where Trump’s tariffs settle and what impact they have on the economy, said Ned Hill, professor emeritus in economic development at Ohio State University.

“With all this uncertainty about what the rest of the year is going to look like,’’ he said, “there’s a hesitancy to hire people just to lay them off in the near future.’’

“Everyone,” said Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products, ”is kind of just waiting for the new normal.’’",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Economy_Manufacturing_25191640383970-1568x1045.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:20:35.663951

,American Energy,2025-07-14 12:40:58+00:00,CalMatters,California's wind and solar projects face new federal hurdles - CalMatters,"Alejandro Lazo, Alejandro Lazo Climate",,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/07/california-wind-solar-projects-face-new-federal-hurdles/,"The changes in federal tax incentives could affect the feasibility of new solar and wind projects as the state is counting on them to provide more electricity for Californians.
Developers of wind and solar projects now face a new, shorter deadline for obtaining tax credits — most now expire at the end of 2027 instead of no sooner than 2032.
In California, 11 solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation, according to an analysis of federal data by Atlas Public Policy provided to CalMatters.
They say the state has too many hurdles for building wind and solar projects and needs to offer more funding.
Rooftop solar projects and heat pump sales also are likely to decrease, the agency said.","California’s drive to run its electric grid entirely on wind, solar and other clean sources of energy just got harder after President Donald Trump signed a sweeping new budget law.

The changes in federal tax incentives could affect the feasibility of new solar and wind projects as the state is counting on them to provide more electricity for Californians. A state law requires 100% of electricity to be powered by renewable, carbon-free sources by 2045, at the same time it’s moving to electrify cars and trucks.

Incentives championed by former President Joe Biden were rolled back, shortening the timeline for the industry to obtain tax credits. Developers of wind and solar projects now face a new, shorter deadline for obtaining tax credits — most now expire at the end of 2027 instead of no sooner than 2032.

In addition, the new federal rules bar companies from accessing tax credits if they rely on major components from China or other “foreign entities of concern.” This restriction could hit California’s solar and wind industry especially hard, experts said.

The changes to tax credits are estimated to save the federal government approximately $499 billion from 2025–2034.

“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” Trump wrote in an executive order last week. “The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.”

Projects can still be built without tax credits. But it puts more of a financial burden on their investors. In California, 11 solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation, according to an analysis of federal data by Atlas Public Policy provided to CalMatters. The projects are spread across the Central Valley, Inland Empire and Northern California.

Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement that the industry was still “assessing what the federal tax bill means for them.” He warned the changes could jeopardize up to 35,700 solar jobs and 25 solar manufacturing facilities in California — including existing positions and factories as well as future projects that may now never materialize.

“The reality is, with or without clean energy tax credits, California’s energy demand is growing at a historic rate, and solar and storage are the fastest and most affordable way to meet that demand,” Gallagher said.

California in recent years has been fast-tracking massive floating offshore wind farms 20 miles off the coasts of Humboldt County and Morro Bay. The federal changes add some uncertainty that could chill investment. But experts say it’s not a death knell for the industry because the projects weren’t set to seek federal permits or generate electricity for at least several years.

“Offshore wind is what we would call a long-lead project. It does take years and years to develop,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, former chair of the Assembly’s Offshore Wind Select Committee. “Solar is a little bit shorter of a time frame…but it’s also his incredibly erratic behavior when it comes to market stability overall that is also going to affect these projects in a negative way.”

Experts say in the long-run, the federal changes could drive up energy costs.

“Tax credit savings are typically passed onto ratepayers through lower contracting costs. In the long term, the repeal of the tax credits will result in higher future electricity rates for customers,” the California Energy Commission told CalMatters.

Rising utility bills are already a major political headache for state leaders and a challenge for clean energy advocates who want the state to lead the way in making electricity cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable.

“The whole point of California’s climate policy is not just to reduce California’s carbon footprint — because we are less than 1% of global emissions — but to set an example and show that this can be done,” Berkeley economist Severin Borenstein told CalMatters. “There are going to be fewer other states following our example because it’s going to be more expensive.”

The new hurdles for solar and wind come as they are scaling up to meet surging electricity demand nationwide, including from energy-hungry data centers fueling the rise of artificial intelligence.

California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner, in an interview with CalMatters, said the federal law is a national “job killer” and was short-sighted. “The economics of renewable energy generation speak for themselves....The cost of solar generation now is competitive with natural gas,” she said.

“We're not going to back away from our commitments and our goals,” she added. “Our commitment — whether it is to zero-emission vehicles, or to renewable energy generation — is about cleaning the air as well as addressing the climate crisis…Nobody wants to live in smoggy communities, where the air you're breathing hurts you.”

Solar and wind projects have helped California log key renewable energy milestones in recent years. Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom said nine out of every 10 days so far in 2025 have been powered by non-fossil fuels for at least a part of the day.

The state’s grid runs on a mix of renewables — solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, biomass and hydropower — an average of seven hours a day, the governor said, citing new data compiled by the California Energy Commission.

“The fourth largest economy in the world is running on more clean energy than ever before,” Newsom said in a statement. “Trump and Republicans can try all they want to take us back to the days of dirty coal but the future is cheap, abundant clean energy.”

But industry officials say the state isn’t doing enough. They say the state has too many hurdles for building wind and solar projects and needs to offer more funding.

“For years now, too many California leaders have retreated from true clean energy leadership — hopefully the tax bill serves as a wakeup call that their leadership on clean energy is more important now than ever,” Gallagher said.

Trump and Congress did not shorten the tax credit deadlines for nuclear power plants, hydroelectric facilities, battery storage and geothermal plants. Congress also dropped a provision that would have added a new excise tax on wind and solar.

For wind and solar, there's still a possible path to claim tax credits if construction starts within a year or they come online by the end of 2027. Senators added that provision to soften the blow. In theory, those projects could be finished and connected to the grid as late as 2031 and still qualify, but that depends on how the Treasury Department defines what it means to “start construction,” said Kevin Book, an energy analyst based in Washington, D.C.

“In the short-term, it might actually increase or shift earlier expenditure on these kinds of clean energy projects and all else equal,” said David Victor, a professor of public policy at UC San Diego. “California is in a pretty good position to profit from that acceleration.”

But Victor warned that the long-term costs could become “a political nightmare.”

“The long-term incentive, clearly, is to try to slow down investment in solar and wind and electric vehicles,” Victor said.

Borenstein took a more measured view about the impact on costs: California’s high electricity prices aren’t mainly about power production — they’re driven by wildfire costs, including past damage payouts and upgrades to prevent future fires. Other drivers include subsidies for low-income customers and the cost shift from rooftop solar, he said.

Some legislators have advocated for the state budget to cover more of these costs, but Borenstein said it’s politically easier to keep charging customers through their electric bills.

Alex Jackson, who leads the industry group American Clean Power California, said the state should use money from its cap-and-trade program to lower bills. Cap and trade is a market system that charges California companies for the greenhouse gas emissions they produce. Jackson said those funds could help pay for grid upgrades so ratepayers don’t have to.

He said the state also could lower clean energy costs by speeding up permitting, easing environmental rules for upgrades to existing projects and reducing costs for turning farmland into solar farms. He also called for expanding regional electricity markets to help California trade power more efficiently — a controversial idea being debated in the Legislature this year.

The state Legislature has debated for years exempting some clean energy projects from the state’s landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act, which is often blamed for delays. State Sen. Scott Wiener, of San Francisco, has advocated for such changes.

“California has always been a leader, and we need to step that up significantly,” Wiener told CalMatters. “We’ve really aggressively invested in clean energy, and we need to ramp up that investment, and we need to make it easier and faster to get clean energy deployed.”

In addition to the wind and solar credits, the budget signed by Trump also ends tax credits for purchase of electric cars, rooftop solar panels, home batteries, heat pumps, insulation, energy-efficient windows and doors, and other upgrades. Rooftop solar tax credits end this year. Federal tax credits for hydrogen production end after 2027 — a blow for California, which had positioned itself as a national hydrogen hub. Those changes are estimated to save about $543 billion from 2025–2034.

The state Energy Commission said the elimination of the EV credits beginning on Sept. 30 will mean ""lower adoption of electric vehicles"" and a ""potential short-term spike in ZEV sales"" before that date. Rooftop solar projects and heat pump sales also are likely to decrease, the agency said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051023_Mojave-Wind-Turbines_LV_CM_09.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-14 10:13:59.126625

Q2: How fast can Huawei’s solid-state EV battery charge?","Synopsis

Huawei EV battery is making headlines with its groundbreaking claim—a solid-state battery that delivers over 3,000 km range on a single charge and can fully charge in just 5 minutes. This next-gen battery uses a nitrogen-doped sulfide electrolyte, offering 400–500 Wh/kg energy density, far higher than current lithium-ion models. While still in the lab phase, this innovation could reshape the electric vehicle industry. If Huawei’s patent turns into reality, it could eliminate range anxiety and cut down charging time drastically. Learn how this tech could rival major battery players like Toyota, CATL, and Samsung SDI by 2030.

Huawei EV battery breakthrough promises 3,000 km range with 5-minute charge—game-changer or just lab hype?- Huawei is making headlines in the EV world with a new patent that could completely transform how we think about electric vehicle batteries. The Chinese tech giant, known for its innovations in telecom and consumer electronics, has claimed to develop a solid-state EV battery capable of delivering a staggering 3,000 km driving range on a single charge. What’s more, this next-gen battery can reportedly charge from 0 to 100% in just 5 minutes.

Filed recently, the patent details a nitrogen-doped sulfide electrolyte-based battery that offers a remarkable energy density of 400–500 Wh/kg, more than double or triple the capacity of traditional lithium-ion batteries. If Huawei can pull this off outside a lab, it might rewrite the rules of the electric vehicle industry.

What makes Huawei’s solid-state EV battery so different?

The core of Huawei’s innovation lies in the nitrogen-doped sulfide electrolyte. This component is designed to tackle two major hurdles faced by solid-state batteries—stabilizing the lithium interface and minimizing harmful side reactions, which often derail performance in real-world use.

Thanks to this upgraded electrolyte, Huawei claims the battery can reach energy densities up to 500 Wh/kg, compared to around 250 Wh/kg in current lithium-ion tech. That’s the key reason the driving range can soar to 3,000 km on a single charge (as per the CLTC—China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle). Even by the stricter EPA cycle, it still holds above 2,000 km, which is far beyond any EV currently on sale globally.

Huawei’s battery breakthrough leaves Tesla racing to catch up

Huawei has stunned the EV world by unveiling a solid-state battery that promises a jaw-dropping 3,000 km range (1,860 miles) and an ultra-fast 5-minute full charge. While still in the patent stage, the battery features sulfide-based solid-state chemistry and 400–500 Wh/kg energy density—far beyond Tesla’s current lithium-ion technology. Though real-world application is years away, this bold innovation signals that Chinese tech giants like Huawei and EV makers like BYD are fast becoming threats to Tesla's dominance.

Live Events

Key Huawei battery highlights:

3,000 km theoretical range (vs Tesla’s ~500 km)

Full charge in ~5 minutes (Tesla takes 15–30 min for partial charges)

2x–3x energy density of Tesla’s current batteries

Still in development—not commercially ready yet

Tesla stock feels the heat as Chinese EV firms surge

Following Huawei’s battery news and BYD’s 5-minute charging breakthroughs, Tesla stock saw a modest decline, while Chinese EV leaders gained momentum. Tesla is still ahead in infrastructure and reliability, but its stock is down ~44% in 2025, reflecting growing concerns about tech leadership. BYD, meanwhile, jumped 4% after unveiling 1,000 kW ultra-fast chargers, further pressuring Tesla’s image as the EV tech leader.

Market and performance comparison:

Tesla Superchargers: ~200 miles in 15 minutes

BYD fast charging: 400 km in 5 minutes (1,000 kW chargers)

Tesla stock: down 44% YTD

BYD stock: rose 4% after fast-charging reveal

Can a 5-minute EV battery charge become the new normal?

Charging speed is just as impressive. According to the patent, the battery can be fully charged in 5 minutes. That’s quicker than your morning coffee. Currently, even the fastest EV chargers take about 20 to 30 minutes to charge a vehicle up to 80%.

This capability could eliminate range anxiety entirely—one of the biggest factors holding consumers back from switching to electric. But here’s the catch: infrastructure to support such ultra-fast charging rates simply doesn’t exist yet in most parts of the world. That includes high-power grid capacity and heat management systems at charging stations.

Is it realistic to expect 3,000+ km range in commercial EVs?

While the theoretical numbers look phenomenal, experts are urging caution. This tech is currently lab-based and has not been tested at mass production scale. A major issue is the sky-high cost of materials like sulfide electrolytes, which are priced around $1,400 per kWh, or about ₹1.2 lakh—making them several times more expensive than conventional battery components.

Additionally, producing these solid-state batteries at scale comes with manufacturing complexities, including precise material handling, safety measures, and temperature controls.

Is Huawei entering the EV battery manufacturing race?

As of now, Huawei does not manufacture power batteries, but the company has been investing heavily in battery research and advanced materials in recent years. Industry insiders believe this signals Huawei’s intent to become a serious player in the EV battery space—especially as the demand for electric vehicles explodes across China and beyond.

While Toyota, Samsung SDI, and CATL are aiming to launch commercial solid-state batteries by 2027–2030, Huawei’s announcement—if proven viable—could accelerate the competition drastically.

Could Huawei's EV battery change the future of electric vehicles?

There’s no doubt that Huawei’s claim—if validated and scaled—has the power to transform the EV industry. A battery that can deliver thousands of kilometers on a single charge and refuel in minutes would erase many of the current limitations of electric mobility.

That said, the road to mass adoption is filled with obstacles—from high costs and supply chain challenges to infrastructure needs and regulatory hurdles. Still, the potential is too big to ignore. Even if the real-world range falls short of the CLTC estimate, a 2,000+ km battery with a five-minute charge time is still revolutionary by today’s standards.

Huawei’s solid-state EV battery technology sounds like something out of the future—but it’s here on paper. The company still needs to prove it can move from lab success to real-world EVs. But if it succeeds, this could mark a major leap forward in how we power our vehicles.

FAQs:

Q1: What is Huawei's new EV battery range?

Huawei’s new solid-state EV battery offers a driving range of over 3,000 km per charge.

Q2: How fast can Huawei’s solid-state EV battery charge?

A milestone for Kansas has arrived as Panasonic is set to hold a grand opening ceremony Monday, July 14, for its electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto, marking the largest investment in the state's history.

Panasonic close to opening $4B electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto

The $4 billion facility transformed the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant site, which had sat empty — since 1992 — until Panasonic selected it for development a few years ago.

""Panasonic Energy plans to build the largest EV battery manufacturing facilities of its kind in De Soto, Kansas,"" Gov. Laura Kelly announced in July 2022 when the project was first revealed.

The massive project promised to bring 4,000 jobs to a town with a population of roughly 6,500.

""It's taking jobs, a job center that had provided jobs to this area for a long time, gone away, and it's bringing them back,"" said De Soto Mayor Rick Walker.

Kansas committed $829 million in state tax incentives to secure the project, along with local tax breaks, land cleanup and new roads.

""It takes money to make money,"" Kelly said at the 2022 announcement.

Later in the year, she added, ""You're gonna see a $2.5 billion impact to the Kansas economy every year that's going to happen. So yes, it was a great investment.""

Over the past three years, thousands have helped build the plant, and local businesses have already felt the impact.

""As soon as they started with the Panasonic plant, we saw a huge influx in our lunchtime business,"" said Scott Hill, owner of JT's Grill in De Soto.

With growth comes change, and not all residents are embracing it the same way.

""I think town is really growing too fast,"" said Chrissy Behee, a lifelong De Soto resident.

Another resident, Mark Snider, expressed similar concerns.

""It's going to change the lifestyle here, though,"" he said.

Despite these reservations, leaders from Panasonic, Kansas and De Soto believe the plant powers more than just batteries.

""We will have resources to allow us to offer benefits to our community, amenities to the community that otherwise we would, as a small town of 6,000, have never been able to provide,"" Mayor Walker said.

Hours before the start of the grand opening ceremony, folks on site representing the facility confirmed to KSHB 41 that production started last week at the plant.

While the loss of the credit could push some automakers to lean more heavily on internal combustion engines, Cadillac appears committed to its EV trajectory. As John Roth, vice president of global Cadillac, put it, “you can never stick your head in the sand.”

Preparing for a Post-Credit Landscape

According to Roth, “the auto business is not a straight line. The EV business is certainly not.” He noted that while Cadillac will remain eligible for the $7,500 lease and non-lease vehicles through the third quarter, it is making plans for when the credit is removed.

Speaking with The Detroit Free Press, Roth didn’t reveal specific steps Cadillac will take once the credits are gone, but he made it clear that adjustments are underway.

“This first-of-its-kind project demonstrates how clean energy can help uplift people working hard to restore their lives,” said Kirsten Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.
The organization hopes to power nearly all of the new building’s electricity needs with solar energy.
Those solar projects will benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities who rely on multifamily affordable housing projects, similar to the residents at The Empowerment Center.
Community solar projects can be hosted by local governments, schools, businesses, or nonprofit that have a building, carport, or other land where solar can be placed.","A new sober living facility in Reno was selected as one of the first in the nation to receive federal funding for rooftop solar development under a Biden-era program that was nearly canceled by the Trump administration earlier this year.

The Empowerment Center – a nonprofit offering affordable housing for low income and at-risk women recovering from substance abuse – will receive more than $960,000 in “Solar for All” funding to install solar at their newly constructed multi-unit housing property.

Last year, Nevada was awarded a $156 million “Solar for All” grant by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support rooftop or community solar projects that benefit low-income households.

Nevada was one of several states cut off from the funding after President Donald Trump called for the immediate halt of energy grants, loans, and contracts funded through the Inflation Reduction Act passed under former president Joe Biden.

The Solar for All program was the only grant under the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to survive the cull. In March EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of the fund’s other two federal grants, eliminating $20 billion in renewable energy investment.

With the survival of the program, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank that administers the “Solar for All” funds — selected the sober living facility as the first project to get the green-light.

“This first-of-its-kind project demonstrates how clean energy can help uplift people working hard to restore their lives,” said Kirsten Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.

Roxanne DeCarlo, the executive director of The Empowerment Center, said the solar installation will be vital to reducing utility costs and helping free up funds for addiction treatment, case management, and support staff.

“When individuals arrive at our program, they are unemployed, homeless, or were recently incarcerated, so we’re really working with individuals that have a very low income. It’s really important that we keep our operations cost as low as possible,” DeCarlo said.

Solar has already proven to be a significant cost-saving measure at the nonprofit’s two other affordable housing facilities, said DeCarlo. The organization hopes to power nearly all of the new building’s electricity needs with solar energy.

Nevada received the highest “Solar for All” funding per capita of any state. In fact, Nevada received the same award amount as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania — states with significantly higher populations.

With robust funding, Nevada’s “Solar for All” program was expected to boost development of rooftop and community solar for low-income households that don’t have access to solar energy due to high upfront installation costs.

But the future of the program has also grown increasingly uncertain after Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, cutting the 30% Clean Electricity Investment Credit for solar projects that start construction after July 4, 2026 — phasing it out six years ahead of schedule. Projects will also need to be in service by the end of 2027 to receive the full credit.

For residential solar, the 30% credit ends entirely at the end of 2025.

Greg Zegas, the managing director of investments at the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said the early termination of tax credits pressures solar project developers to start construction before the end of the year. The deadline particularly impacts working families who rely on the tax credit to make solar affordable as electricity prices continue to climb.

“That’s a tax credit that is really beneficial for clean energy projects like solar,” Zegas said. “It basically means that any project that’s starting construction after 2025 is going to face additional hurdles for claiming the full value of the tax credit.”

In order to fill the funding gap left by the dissolution of those credits, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund may need to cover more solar installation costs in the state while funding less projects.

“If we’re putting more money out towards grants, then it would reduce the amount of funding that we have for projects,” Zegas said.

Despite a tight deadline and other challenges, Zegas said the Nevada Clean Energy Fund is optimistic they can get the $156 million allocated to Nevada “out the door to benefit households across the state.”

In the next few weeks, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund plans to finalize funding for several other “Solar for All” projects, said Zegas.

Those solar projects will benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities who rely on multifamily affordable housing projects, similar to the residents at The Empowerment Center.

Community solar projects can be hosted by local governments, schools, businesses, or nonprofit that have a building, carport, or other land where solar can be placed.

“This program is really focused on benefiting low-income communities. Those populations face the highest utility bill burden proportionate to their income. That’s our goal with these projects, to reduce those energy costs and share those savings for households,” Zegas said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Marvel-Exterior-1-635x425-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:21:07.763759

Central to this plan is the launch of DRIVE35, a ten-year programme supporting innovation, infrastructure, and job creation across the sector.

This comprehensive investment package aims to future-proof the UK’s automotive industry by accelerating the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), supporting a wide range of projects from large-scale gigafactories to start-ups developing breakthrough technologies.

Commenting on the landmark investment, Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “We’re helping British carmakers get to the front of the pack by working hand in hand with investors to build a globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain in the UK.

“We’re taking action to back the industry for the future with the biggest set of announcements for the sector in the last decade.

“This includes securing a landmark trade deal with the US to bring down tariffs for British car manufacturers, measures in our modern Industrial Strategy to lower electricity prices, and updating the ZEV mandate, supporting UK manufacturers to safeguard jobs, and secure the future of the sector.

Introducing DRIVE35: A decade of innovation

Announced as part of the Advanced Manufacturing Sector Plan, DRIVE35 will direct £2bn to electric vehicle manufacturing and infrastructure by 2030, alongside £500m dedicated to research and development through 2035.

Built on the success of earlier schemes like the Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF) and the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC), DRIVE35 will expand the reach and scale of previous initiatives.

These earlier programmes helped leverage more than £6bn in private sector investment and created thousands of jobs across the UK.

DRIVE35 will streamline support into three key pillars:

Transformation: Supporting capital investments in facilities and technologies for zero-emission vehicle manufacturing.

Scale-up feasibility: Funding strategic studies to grow early-stage projects into large-scale operations.

Innovation competitions: Backing early and late-stage R&D to keep the UK at the cutting edge of EV technology.

Ian Constance, CEO, Advanced Propulsion Centre UK and Zenzic, added: “This new investment underlines the commitment from the government to secure advanced manufacturing in the UK.

“I am pleased that the APC, Zenzic, and its delivery partners are here to facilitate a new wave of funding in the automotive industry, supporting innovation, driving scale-up, and enabling transformation.

“We have announced projects receiving four types of grants that boost the UK’s leadership in automotive manufacturing. They will enable the rapid development of demonstrators featuring cutting-edge technology, accelerate ambitious SMEs, and support vital collaborative R&D innovation.

“This will encourage further investment in the UK’s growing zero-emission supply chain, safeguarding skilled jobs, and building on the country’s reputation as a world-leader for technology.”

Sector-wide impact: From prototypes to EV production lines

DRIVE35 is designed to benefit automotive companies of all sizes, from global OEMs to ambitious UK start-ups. Successful applicants will receive targeted funding to scale projects, secure jobs, and cut emissions.

The government has confirmed that the first set of competitions under DRIVE35 will open immediately, offering opportunities for capital investment, feasibility planning, and R&D collaboration.

In addition, the Department for Business and Trade announced £300m in new investments supporting specific firms and innovations. Highlights include:

£100 million+ from Astemo Ltd. for EV component production in Bolton, creating over 220 high-value jobs.

£15 million from Dana in the West Midlands to manufacture essential EV parts, supporting over 100 skilled roles.

£18 million from the new £150m Connected & Automated Mobility (CAM) Pathfinder programme.

These investments aim to generate tens of thousands of jobs, unlock billions in private investment, and support the production of millions of zero-emission vehicles.

£63m boost for EV infrastructure

To supercharge the UK’s EV charging network, the government has also announced a £63m investment aimed at making EV ownership more affordable and accessible.

A £25m scheme for local authorities will help households without driveways install affordable at-home charging via innovative cross-pavement cable technology. This could save families up to £1,500 a year compared to petrol or diesel costs.

The initiative complements the Local EV Infrastructure Fund and £6bn in private sector commitments, expected to deliver an additional 100,000 chargepoints by 2030.

Greening the NHS: £8m for ambulance electrification

In a landmark move for public services, the NHS will receive £8m to support the electrification of its vehicle fleets. Over 1,200 charging sockets will be installed across 200 NHS sites, leading to major long-term savings on fuel and maintenance.

This initiative not only supports environmental goals but also helps redirect millions in cost savings back into patient care, aiding the NHS’s broader sustainability and efficiency ambitions.

Better signage and business support

To help EV drivers more easily access the expanding network, new road signage will be rolled out to mark charging hubs on A-roads for the first time.

The number of major charging hubs has more than doubled since 2023, and clearer signage is expected to make long-distance EV journeys more convenient.

In parallel, the government is launching a new grant scheme to assist businesses in installing depot-based charging for vans, coaches, and HGVs, supporting the wider commercial transition to zero emissions.

Future-proofing the UK auto industry

With the automotive sector contributing £21.4bn in gross value added (GVA) and employing over 132,000 people in 2024, DRIVE35 represents a transformative opportunity.

The UK Government’s long-term backing aims to position the country as a global hub for electric vehicle manufacturing, innovation, and export.

By combining public funding with private investment, fostering cutting-edge R&D, and scaling essential infrastructure, the UK is poised to lead the world in the race to a zero-emission future.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2538883335.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:13:29.720407

The enactment of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), with its early phaseout of federal support for large-scale wind and solar projects, creates a major challenge for how to meet growing U.S. energy demand. Combined with battery storage, renewables have become the fastest, most efficient new sources of electricity, so the prospect that fewer such systems will be added to the grid by the end of the decade raises the prospect of higher energy prices. There’s also a risk this could slow the fast-growing AI industry, where the U.S. has taken an early global lead.

""With such dramatic uncertainty facing new power supply investments, thermal retirements are likely to be deferred, power prices will rise and large loads will be delayed,"" David Brown, director of energy transition research for Wood Mackenzie, said in a recent report. ""Without permitting reform, new large load tariffs and domestic technology innovation, the U.S. will risk the edge it has in the global AI race.

Under OBBBA, new wind and solar projects have to be in operation by Dec. 31, 2027, to get the full federal tax credit, though projects under construction within a year of its enactment will still have some eligibility. As a result, there’s likely to be a surge in new installations this year and next to meet the deadline, though that could also bring permitting bottlenecks. The number of new projects is likely to slow considerably in the final years of the 2020s, however.

As a result, solar installations may be 17% lower over the next 10 years than anticipated, while wind projects will likely drop by 20%, Wood Mackenzie said. At the same time, electric power demand is forecast to grow steadily, rising 25% by 2030 compared with 2023, according to an estimate by ICF.

“The early sunset of manufacturing tax credits will lower future energy demand from clean energy manufacturing, while delays to new supply could slow data center rollouts nationwide as facilities compete for scarce grid capacity,” Brown said.

The Big Read

Elon Musk’s Robotaxi Dream Could Be A Liability Nightmare For Tesla And Its Owners

Elon Musk’s tightly controlled Tesla robotaxi pilot program in Austin has managed to go without a major accident so far. But on June 24, a Model Y in its test fleet dinged a parked Toyota Camry outside a popular pizza parlor. It was a minor thing, but what if the car had hit a person instead?

Bullish Tesla investors are counting on Musk’s robotaxi dream to create a vast new revenue stream from autonomous rides. That may happen, but it also creates a risk the company hasn’t faced before: legal liability from self-driving tech failures. Tesla owners hoping to make money Airbnb-ing their cars in a company-run robotaxi ride service Musk has touted for years could be on the hook as well.

“There will be some cars that Tesla owns itself … but then for the fleet that is owned by our customers it will be like an Airbnb thing. You can add or subtract your car to the fleet whenever you want,” Musk said at Tesla’s shareholder meeting last June. “Just one tap on the Tesla app and you can add your car to the fleet and it makes money for you while you’re gone.”

But Tesla owners hoping to cash in have more to consider.

“Can I imagine a lawsuit against the owner of the car? Absolutely,” said Mike Nelson, an attorney who says he’s been involved in over a thousand Tesla-related accident cases and whose startup, QuantivRisk, analyzes sensor and computer data from crashes. In addition to suing Tesla in future robotaxi accident cases, he sees lawyers coming after Tesla owners: “Plaintiff’s attorneys are going to say something like, ‘the car was not properly maintained’ or ‘you misrepresented the condition of the car.’”

Assuming Tesla’s robotaxi tech is truly ready for commercial use, which many autonomous vehicle experts doubt, the pitch by the world’s wealthiest person to owners to monetize their vehicles may excite some. It could also prove to be the latest in an impressive cascade of ill-starred Musk pipe dreams: hyperloops, solar roofs, $2 trillion in government DOGE cuts. And while Musk has been vocal about how game-changing Tesla’s robotaxi plans are for the company’s future, particularly as its EV sales stall, he’s said little about how it will actually run.

Beth Deane, chief legal officer for Electric Hydrogen, on the survival of federal hydrogen tax credits in Trump’s budget bill

The outlook for the 45V federal credit seemed grim in the new budget but it was maintained in the final version. Was that unexpected?

It was really kind of a surprising vote of confidence and investment in the industry, although the ultimate runway was shortened from what's in the Inflation Reduction Act. I think the journey that the hydrogen industry took through the reconciliation process really created an opportunity for an education process within Congress and within the administration about what the opportunity is for the hydrogen industry. I think the shift to extend the runway in the final version reflected that there is an opportunity for the U.S. to take a portion of what's going to be a global market.

The tax credit is just ultimately an investment to see if the U.S. can compete. The extension suggests they believe the U.S. can compete, and certainly there are a lot of projects that are ready to go forward that have been waiting for the regulatory certainty that we now have. It wasn't always clear that that was going to be the case.

Earlier in the year Electric Hydrogen was seeing fewer opportunities for its electrolyzer tech in the U.S. and was looking abroad to Europe and other markets. Are you seeing that change now?

We are, but I don't think it changes our ultimate strategy. We're still very focused on expanding into Europe. We have hired actually a number of folks there and are building out that capacity to really get close to customers in Europe. Europe is also heading toward regulatory certainty, so it's an interesting kind of pivot point.

The 45V credit isn’t specifically for green hydrogen. What is the outlook for that variety?

There are projects. We have customers who are going to be announcing and moving forward in the process. Infinium is obviously a project that's getting built and is going to be where we are able to prove out our technology at the scale we want to sell it at. We're a young company, but it's very interesting to us that Infinium really saw the offtake opportunity and that offtake opportunity is only going to grow. It is hard to be first, but they are the first to really scale here. We see other customers who are ready to do the same thing.

One of the things that has been hard for the hydrogen industry is that we couldn't get going and show success. There was no regulatory certainty. You can't finance projects until you know what the full stack of costs and revenues is going to be.

So it is a little bit of an opportunity to prove what the industry can do over the next few years.

Additionally, the letter states issue with the Good Neighbor Plan and Effluent Limitations Guidelines for power plants.","EVANSVILLE — Evansville has long been called a ""sacrifice zone"" due to nearby pollution hazards, and the current attitude of federal leaders toward environmental safeguards has local advocates concerned.

Nicole Chandler, Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign organizer for Southwest Indiana, said there isn't one specific regulation the Environmental Protection Agency's could roll back that would be bad for the area. Instead, she said, rolling back any of them would be detrimental.

""These environmental protections are put into place to protect us,"" Chandler said. ""So when the administration is signaling they want to roll them back, that shows to us that they don't care about clean air and clean water.""

In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the ""greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen."" He said the regulations of administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had ""suffocated"" the economy.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" he said.

His announcement included plans to change regulations around power plants, the oil and gas industry, mercury and air toxics standards, the Regional Haze Rule and the Good Neighbor Plan.

The Good Neighbor Plan aims to make sure 23 states, including Indiana, meet the Clean Air Act’s “Good Neighbor” requirements by reducing pollution. The Regional Haze Rule calls for state and federal agencies to work together to improve visibility in 156 national parks and wilderness areas. The closest location included in the rule is Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky.

The Good Neighbor Plan is not currently in effect; it was put on hold by the Supreme Court in 2024.

""Even one rule or regulation getting rolled back will have a harmful impact on our community,"" Chandler said. ""You know it's just not coal plants around us, it's the coal plants that are across the river too. Pollution doesn't stay in one place. It travels, so that's the concern we have.""

Neighboring coal plants a concern for Sierra Club

Chandler said the three coal plants of concern are Duke Energy's Gibson Station coal plant in Gibson County; CenterPoint's Energy F.B. Culley Plant; and the Warrick Aluminum Smelting Plant.

CenterPoint's Culley Plant is a current concern for Sierra Club organizers because it was the utility said it would be coal-free by 2027, but in its current 20-year planning process, that is being potentially pushed back to 2030.

F.B. Culley Unit 3 was set to convert to natural gas by 2027, but meeting minutes from the most recent planning session state CenterPoint is considering other options.

These include a conversion to natural gas by 2030, retirement by 2032, or co-fire by 2030 and retirement by 2039.

While these three are the main focuses of concern, Chandler argues that any coal plant near in the area is bad.

""A lot of these are really old and uneconomic plants and they just have such detrimental health impacts,"" she said.

In January, Duke Energy officials, along with other power companies, sent a letter to Zeldin asking incoming President Donald Trump's administration to rollback regulations on areas of their work.

In the letter, Duke Energy states it wants ""swift and sustained"" action by the Trump Administration, and that recent changes by the EPA have resulted ""in significant burdens on the nation’s power sector without tangible benefits.""

""These regulations, individually and collectively, threaten the reliability of the power grid, jeopardize national security, are a drag on economic growth, increase inflation, and hinder the expansion of electric power generation to support the critical development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies,"" the letter states.

In particular, Duke called for attention to the regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and coal combustion residuals.

""The new administration should decline to defend these unlawful rules and should seek their immediate recission,"" the letter states.

Additionally, the letter states issue with the Good Neighbor Plan and Effluent Limitations Guidelines for power plants. Effluent limitation guidelines are national regulatory standards for wastewater discharged to surface waters and municipal sewage treatment plants.

""These other recent rules, like the GHG and CCR rules, do not further EPA’s statutory mission to protect human health and the environment"" the letter states, ""and instead will result in unnecessary costs on the power sector, impacting the affordability and reliability of electricity.""

Concerns are in both the air and water

Chandler said the health impacts from potential rule changes are not just focused on air quality or water pollution. Both are concerns in this area of the state.

""We just have really poor air quality here,"" Chandler said. ""And you know, I think it's kind of telling that there are lots of restrictions around how much fish you can even eat out of the Ohio River.""

In May, Sierra Club rolled out a new dashboard that it states show the impact rollbacks to EPA standards on coal pollution would have on the U.S.

The dashboard estimates if effluent limitation guidelines were upheld, the F.B. Culley plant would release more than 14,000 tons less in wastewater pollution than if they are rolled back.

If the Regional Haze Act stays intact, the release of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides from the Warrick County plant would be reduced by 75% and 47% respectively, as estimated by the Sierra Club.

Nitrogen oxides are the mixture of gases composed of nitrogen and oxygen. Most significant are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust, burning coal, oil, or natural gas, and during processes such as arc welding and electroplating. Sulfur dioxide is a gas composed of sulfur and oxygen. Sulfur dioxide forms when sulfur-containing fuel such as coal, petroleum oil or diesel is burned.

According to the American Lung Association, long-term exposure to high levels of sulfur dioxide increases respiratory symptoms and reduces the ability of the lungs to function. Short-term exposure can make it difficult for those with asthma to breathe outdoors.

State leaders signal desire to roll back environmental regulations

On July 1, Gov. Mike Braun and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management announced a plan that identified regulations to be changed.

“Government naturally drifts toward over-regulation, and it’s important to go through these regulations to make sure they aren’t stifling innovation an raising the cost of living for no benefit,"" Braun stated in a news release. ""My agencies have been directed to identify regulations that are raising the cost of living without benefiting our environment so they can be changed or rescinded; we can grow our economy while also safeguarding Hoosiers’ health and preserving our natural resources.”

Gov. Mike Braun signs his first executive orders as Governor of Indiana, Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2025 in his office at Indiana Statehouse.

In March, Braun signed an executive order that Indiana would not make rules on environmental regulations that surpassed those at the federal level. It directed agencies to identify state regulations that were ""unduly burdensome, significantly raise the cost of living for Hoosiers, are not supported by current law and the best available science, or do not benefit Indiana’s environment.""

In the July 1 report, IDEM and Braun recommended 10 regulations to be changed or rescinded. The report also contained examples of the how IDEM will work with the federal government in an effort to pursue reforms that enact Braun's executive order supporting extensions for using coal to generate power.

""For example, EPA took a recent action to ensure that Indiana energy producers were not unnecessary penalized under federal air quality requirements for keeping coal-fired power plants open,"" the report states. ""Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana recently announced a settlement, aligned with Governor Braun’s energy-related executive orders, to evaluate the continued operation of coal units at its Cayuga Generating Station in Vermillion County.""

The IndyStar recently reported on that Duke settlement.

CHICAGO, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. biofuel makers will consume more than half of all soybean oil produced in the U.S. next year as a recent flurry of federal policy moves has transformed the sector, including higher blending mandates and curbs on foreign biofuel imports and feedstocks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Friday.

In a monthly supply-and-demand report, the USDA sharply raised its outlook for soybean oil use by biofuel producers in the 2025/26 marketing year, which begins Oct. 1, to a record 15.5 billion pounds, up 11.5% from its forecast a month ago and 26.5% higher than the current marketing year.

U.S. soy oil exports were seen tumbling to 700 million pounds in 2025/26 as more oil is consumed domestically, down from 2.6 billion pounds in the current season.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix in 2026 and 2027, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates, along with measures to discourage biofuel imports.

The moves were welcomed by the nation's fast-growing biofuels industry after months of policy uncertainty that had hobbled output of fuels made from vegetable oils like soy oil, canola oil and used cooking oil.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the U.S. fuel supply or purchase credits known as RINs from those that do.

""EPA not only significantly raised the mandates but also proposed to reduce the number of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) generated for imported renewable fuels and renewable fuels produced from foreign feedstocks starting in 2026, which increases demand for domestically produced feedstocks like soybean oil,"" the USDA said on Friday.

Additional incentives via state biofuel mandates and the federal 45Z clean fuel production tax credit in U.S. President Donald Trump's recently enacted budget law further fueled the outlook for soy oil use in biofuel, the USDA said.

Sherita Hamlin has watched her utility bills more than double in recent years. On Chicago’s West Side, summer air conditioning is a luxury she now rations. Groceries and entertainment for her five children take a back seat to keeping the lights on.

Hamlin estimates that her monthly electric bill has climbed from $70 to $150 over the last five years, while her monthly winter gas bills have risen from $110 to $220.

“I thank God for the LIHEAP program,” she said, referring to the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federal energy assistance program that helped her avoid shutoffs. “Once that credit kicks in, it helps knock down the past due bills.”

That critical support is now in jeopardy.

Support for people like Hamlin could be undermined by the Trump administration’s push to defund federal energy assistance for low-income households, eliminate clean energy tax credits, and keep expensive coal generation online.

The Trump administration fired every staffer administering the LIHEAP program this spring, and the administration has proposed eliminating funding for the program entirely.

Across the Great Lakes, electricity and gas costs are rising, with utilities in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin seeking hundreds of millions in additional rate hikes. Advocates point to a perfect storm: aging infrastructure, climate-driven disasters, profit incentives that reward utility spending, high rates of return for investors, and weak regulatory oversight.

Energy bills outrun inflation: ‘National issue’

As of April 2025, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin had the highest residential electric rates in the East North Central region, outpacing Indiana and Ohio, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Nationally, residential energy bills have outpaced inflation since 2022, according to the EIA data, while consumers face rising costs for other essentials like food and housing.

Between 2014 and 2024, electric rates in Illinois and Michigan rose slightly faster than inflation, while Wisconsin’s stayed just below it. Over the longer term, inflation-adjusted rates have climbed sharply: since 2001, residential electricity prices have increased in Michigan (31%), Wisconsin (23%), and Illinois (3%)

Most real wage growth since 2001 has accrued to higher-income workers, while real wages for low- and middle-income groups have remained largely stagnant. This leaves lower- and middle-income groups less able to keep up with inflation for basic necessities like utilities.

Research from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy shows that a significant portion of low-income households spend a disproportionate share of their income on energy bills.

Energy affordability experts consider 6% of income spent on energy to be affordable. But in many U.S. metro areas, one in four low-income households spends over 15% of their income on energy, far above that threshold. These high energy burdens can force difficult choices between paying utility bills and other essentials like food or medicine.

“This is a national issue — but we’re not having a national conversation about it,” said Charles Hua, director of the advocacy group PowerLines. While wildfires raise prices in the West and gas volatility affects the Northeast, ballooning infrastructure costs are the main driver in the Midwest, Hua said.

Utilities earn a rate of return on capital investments, which encourages them to build rather than maintain infrastructure, Hua said. Public service commissions approve these profit rates — often approaching 10% — that companies then return to shareholders.

The impact is deeply felt. Eighty-one percent of Midwest ratepayers feel powerless over rising bills, the highest percentage of any U.S. region, according to a recent PowerLines/Ipsos poll. Most expect rates to increase further, and two-thirds say utility costs are a source of financial stress.

‘Relentless churn’ of rate hike requests

Utilities in the Great Lakes states are filing rate hike requests more frequently, and often with little resistance, advocates say. Regulators and consumer advocates often find themselves outmatched, working under tight deadlines and with fewer resources than the utilities they’re tasked with overseeing.

“We’re seeing a relentless churn of rate case filings across the Upper Midwest,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute.

In Michigan, the timeline between Consumers Energy’s electric rate requests shrank from 18 months in 2012 to 15 months in 2024. DTE Energy’s filings accelerated from every two years to roughly every 17 months, according to MLive. At the same time, lawmakers shortened the review window for rate cases from 12 to 10 months, leaving less time for scrutiny from public interest groups and the public.

“That creates an asymmetry where the utility gets whatever time they want to prepare their rate cases … and the rest of us have what works out to be a tight schedule to argue against it,” said Douglas Jester, a consultant with 5 Lakes Energy who frequently contributes to rate case testimony.

Michigan’s 2016 energy law made the process even tougher by allowing utilities to base rate increases on future projected spending rather than historical costs. The industry refers to this as the “future test year” model. Critics argue that it requires regulators to approve budgets without full visibility into utility operations.

Illinois and Wisconsin face similar time constraints for rate case decisions as Michigan, while Weinman said regulators often work with limited staff.

Abe Scarr of Illinois PIRG said it’s a one-sided system.

“They know everything about their infrastructure — we know only what we can extract.”

Weinmann said that rate hike requests compound previous increases, and utilities are likely to continue their pace of requests until they encounter pushback from regulators.

“We’re seeing examples here and there where commissions limit to varying degrees how much utilities can raise rates, but they’re still achieving the objective of raising rates,” she said.

‘Gold plating’ the grid

Consumer advocates say utilities are inflating costs by “gold plating” the grid: investing in unnecessary capital projects to maximize profits, rather than prioritizing preventive maintenance like tree trimming.

“There’s always concern they’re pushing too much into the capital side,” said Tom Content, director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin.

Here’s how it works: When utilities invest in infrastructure — like poles, wires, or substations — they’re allowed to recover those costs from customers, plus a rate of return, approved by state regulators. This profit is only earned on capital spending, not operational expenses, giving utilities a financial incentive to build more, even if it’s not the most efficient option.

Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, said costly and often avoidable replacements of transmission lines, transformers, poles, and pole tops are examples of overbuilding for investor gain.

At the center of this problem is the high rate of return utilities earn on infrastructure investments. In Michigan and Wisconsin, those returns have hovered around 10%, despite utility stocks being low-risk compared to the broader market. A January report from the Economic Liberties Project found these profits cost the average U.S. customer an additional $300 per year.

5 Lakes Energy’s Jester said Michigan regulators have generally reduced the capital costs utilities can recoup in rate cases, typically by 40%–50%, although advocates push for 60%-70% cuts. Shrinking the gap between what utilities propose and what’s truly needed could help keep rates below inflation, he said.

Still, not all costs are avoidable. Aging infrastructure and climate extremes are driving legitimate spending needs. A 2024 state audit revealed that significant portions of DTE and Consumers Energy’s systems were over 50 years old, with some components dating back more than a century.

Severe weather is compounding the problem. In 2023, a single ice storm cost DTE $50 million in repairs. Derechos in 2020 and 2021 caused billions in regional damage, according to a report in The Detroit Free Press. These events — now more frequent due to climate change — are straining outdated systems and driving up rates.

Advocates call for stronger laws, oversight, public support

To rein in rising energy costs, advocates say states need to do more than tweak rate cases — they need stronger laws, better-funded oversight, and support for low-income customers.

In Chicago, Hamlin said the Low Income Discount program from Peoples Gas cut her monthly bills significantly. She also hopes to benefit from Illinois’s Solar for All program, which allows renters and homeowners to subscribe to community solar arrays and earn bill credits with no upfront cost.

Advocates say far more needs to be done to protect ratepayers’ interests.

“The consumer voice is really not that represented in the (public service commission) ecosystem,” said PowerLines’ Hua. “There are very few people who show up to a PSC hearing and provide public comment.”

Advocates say better funding for those groups, and the commissions themselves, would help prevent utilities from overbuilding infrastructure and provide more support for energy efficiency programs.

In Michigan, energy consultant Jester said reform would require new legislation, noting that laws give utilities an unfair advantage, such as the shortened timelines for rate case reviews. Meanwhile, utilities wield considerable political influence.

In 2022, dark money groups linked to Consumers Energy and DTE contributed a combined $9.5 million to Michigan political campaigns, according to reporting from Bridge Michigan.

Utility spokespeople say the companies follow the law and that no customer funds are used for political donations; critics dispute this claim. Advocates in Michigan have launched a ballot initiative to restrict utilities’ political donations.

DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said the company is “committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and complies with all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions.”

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.13newsnow.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:39:13.020482

Temperatures in the southwestern city of El Granado reached nearly 115 degrees (46 degrees Celsius), a national record for June.
Climate change is also transforming the Spanish landscape, including the beach in Montgat, where increasingly frequent storms have washed much of the sand away.
“The main risk humankind faces today, undoubtedly, is climate change,” said Sira Rego, a minister in the government led by Pedro Sánchez.
She said climate change had forced the city to think of its overtourism problem differently, to come up with measures that addressed both.","Not so long ago, families coming to the shore in Montgat, Spain, just outside Barcelona, built sand castles, played paddle games and lounged around on the broad band of sand that was the picture of the European summer vacation. But now in some places, there is hardly enough room to put down a towel.

“From here to there,” said Sofia Mella, 19, as she pointed far out to sea, “it was all sand.”

Climate change is changing Europe into a summer paradise lost. Across Spain, Italy, Greece, France and beyond, sand-devouring storms, rising seas, asphyxiating temperatures, deadly floods and horrific wildfires have year after year turned some of the continent’s most desired getaways into miserable locales to get away from.

As southern Europeans dream of fjords, the traditional hot spots and fixtures of travel agency package deals no longer seem so desirable. This past week, even though temperatures broke across much of the continent, experts and officials warned that the next heat wave would come soon, endangering vulnerable locals and making tourists question what they had gotten themselves into. Even activists seeking to free their cities from the scourge of overtourism saw no silver lining to the brutal conditions.

Last year, Mr. Pardo Rivacoba’s group went viral by organizing demonstrations against overtourism that including spraying tourists with water guns. This year, he said, it was so hot that “we used the water guns on ourselves.”

Across the continent, June was the cruelest month. So far. In Rome, tourists rotated around the city’s sites as if spinning in an outdoor microwave. Opera singers in Verona passed out in their costumes.

But Spain has become the least fun-in-the-sun destination. Temperatures in the southwestern city of El Granado reached nearly 115 degrees (46 degrees Celsius), a national record for June. And there were other grim metrics. Last year, floods in Valencia killed more than 200 people; this year, experts say excess deaths, especially among the ailing and elderly, have risen sharply with the temperatures.

Climate change is also transforming the Spanish landscape, including the beach in Montgat, where increasingly frequent storms have washed much of the sand away.

Barcelona, only a few miles away, has reported losing 30,000 square meters of sand over the past five years. Marina d’Or, outside Valencia farther south, was envisioned by developers and families across Spain as a seaside resort, an emblem of the country’s beach holidays. Now, storms have washed some of its beaches away, too. Experts have estimated the loss of hundreds of thousands of square meters of beach across the country, and warned about desertification.

Spain knows it has a problem. In a time of right-wing opposition to Europe’s environment-protecting Green Deal regulations — “greenlash,” it has been called — the progressive government of Spain has embraced an ecological transition.

“The main risk humankind faces today, undoubtedly, is climate change,” said Sira Rego, a minister in the government led by Pedro Sánchez. She called responding to those changes the country’s “priority in terms of security.”

At more local levels, cities like Barcelona are also trying to mitigate the damage wrought by a changing climate.

Laia Bonet, the city’s first deputy mayor responsible for ecology and urban planning, said that Barcelona was “especially exposed to the effects of climate change,” and that it was working to address the reality of a hotter city with higher sea levels and eroded beaches.

The city’s priority, she said, is protecting vulnerable residents with hundreds of climate shelters. But it is also investing 1.8 billion euros, more than $2 billion, to make buildings greener, expand green spaces, install 200 shade structures, and replace some pavements with dirt to better absorb and repurpose rain water.

The city is also using sand recovered from construction projects to help preserve its beaches, which are a beloved public space for locals to cool off, as well as a guard against storm surges, and a critical element in the city’s identity as a tourist destination. About 15 percent of Barcelona’s economy comes from tourism.

She said climate change had forced the city to think of its overtourism problem differently, to come up with measures that addressed both. “These are progressive policies that cities can implement as an antidote,” she said.

In Seville, the southern Spanish city sometimes called “the frying pan” of Europe, nuns have long hung white drapes around their cloisters to keep the sun out. But the city has more recently started covering its narrow streets with white sheets, pulled across the rooftops like canopies. Parts of the city are using an ancient system of underground ducts to bring cooler air to the surface, while another project pumps water runoff into shaded public spaces, often cooled by mists. The city has started naming heat waves to make them more palpable and memorable.

That is important, experts say, because once the heat waves pass, people tend to forget about them. So scientists in recent days have rushed out estimates that the heat wave may have tripled the death toll in afflicted regions across the continent. The goal, one of the scientists has said, is to focus attention on the dangers of extreme heat when people were extremely hot.

But instead of changing their behavior, many Southern Europeans suffering during the sweltering heat waves have resorted to hatching escape plans. In Barcelona, three older Spanish women sitting in the shade across from the city’s cathedral fantasized about cloudy Galicia in the north. And Romans with healthy travel budgets have started looking longingly at damp, chilly, often overlooked nations.

“It could happen that if it gets too hot people could come to Belgium,” said Ann Verdonck, 45, from near Antwerp, who was on vacation with her family in Barcelona, where she said last month’s temperatures were untenable. “And then we will have too many people.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/14/multimedia/14int-spain-heat-wjgm/14int-spain-heat-wjgm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 09:12:06.379910

Abbott’s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the records, including whether The Texas Newsroom would be refunded if Paxton withholds them.","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott doesn’t want to reveal months of communications with Elon Musk or representatives from the tech mogul’s companies, arguing in part that they are of a private nature, not of public interest and potentially embarrassing.

Musk had an eventful legislative session in Texas this year. In addition to his lobbyists successfully advocating for several new laws, Abbott cited the Tesla and SpaceX CEO as the inspiration for the state creating its own efficiency office and has praised him for moving the headquarters for many of his businesses to the state in recent years.

As part of an effort to track the billionaire’s influence in the state Capitol, The Texas Newsroom in April requested Abbott and his staff’s emails since last fall with Musk and other people who have an email address associated with some of his companies.

Initially, the governor’s office said it would take more than 13 hours to review the records. It provided a cost estimate of $244.64 for the work and required full payment up front. The Texas Newsroom agreed and cut a check.

After the check was cashed, the governor’s office told The Texas Newsroom it believed all of the records were confidential and asked Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office referees disputes over public records, to allow the documents to be kept private.

Matthew Taylor, Abbott’s public information coordinator, gave several reasons the records should not be released. He argued they include private exchanges with lawyers, details about policy-making decisions and information that would reveal how the state entices companies to invest here. Releasing them to the public, he wrote, “would have a chilling effect on the frank and open discussion necessary for the decision-making process.”

Taylor also argued that the communications are confidential under an exception to public records laws known as “common-law privacy” because they consist of “information that is intimate and embarrassing and not of legitimate concern to the public, including financial decisions that do not relate to transactions between an individual and a governmental body.”

He did not provide further details about the exact content of the records.

The language Abbott’s office used appears to be fairly boilerplate. Paxton’s office, in an explanation of the common-law privacy exception on its website, mentions that “personal financial information” that doesn’t deal with government transactions “is generally highly intimate or embarrassing and must be withheld.”

But Bill Aleshire, a Texas-based attorney specializing in public records law, was appalled that the governor is claiming that months of emails between his office and one of the world’s richest people are all private.

“Right now, it appears they’ve charged you $244 for records they have no intention of giving you,” Aleshire said. “That is shocking.”

Aleshire said it’s not unusual for government agencies to tap the common-law privacy exception in an attempt to withhold records from the public. But he’s used to it being cited in cases that involve children, medical data or other highly personal information — not for emails between an elected official and a businessman.

“You’re boxing in the dark,” Aleshire said. “You can’t even see what the target is or what’s behind their claim.”

Aleshire added that due to a recent Texas Supreme Court ruling, there is effectively no way to enforce public records laws against Abbott and other top state officials. He called the decision an “ace card” for these politicians.

The case dealt with requests to release Abbott and Paxton’s communications in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde. The high court ruled that it is the only body that can review whether these officials are in compliance with public records laws.

Kevin Bagnall, a lawyer representing Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, also wrote a letter to Paxton’s office arguing the emails should be kept secret. He cited one main reason: They contain “commercial information whose disclosure would cause SpaceX substantial competitive harm.”

Most of the rest of Bagnall’s letter, which further explained SpaceX’s argument, was redacted.

Musk and representatives for his companies did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Abbott’s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the records, including whether The Texas Newsroom would be refunded if Paxton withholds them.

In a statement, he said, “The Office of the Governor rigorously complies with the Texas Public Information Act and will release any responsive information that is determined to not be confidential or excepted from disclosure.”

The office of the attorney general has 45 business days to determine whether to release Abbott’s records.",https://img.assets-d.propublica.org/v5/images/20250108-weather-press-conf09_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_quality_95_embedColorProfile_true.jpg?crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&imgixProfile=propublicaAssetsV5&q=90&w=1200&s=79ce7f1867b4ef236c71f7c2b6c5d7a5,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:49.663862

Joanne continued, “Clear directives from the government will not only help bridge the skills gap, but they will also signal that the UK is serious about delivering on its clean energy ambitions.

This follows the news that ‘shovel-ready’ wind and solar farms will be prioritised for grid connections, a move that replaces the longstanding first-come, first-served approach, which has led to unviable schemes holding up clean energy projects ready to plug in.

Egis has welcomed this decision, recognising it as a crucial step in unlocking the nation’s renewable energy process and accelerating towards net zero.

Yet, the business has warned that, for communities across Britain to ‘benefit from good jobs and investment in the clean energy economy’, the industry needs to see the short- to medium-term government initiatives that will be taken to close the estimated shortfall of 200,000 workers.

As a recent investor in the sector through various acquisitions, Egis has similarly committed to supporting the rapid deployment of resilient and sustainable infrastructure that will power the energy transition.

“We applaud the government’s commitment to accelerating clean energy development,” said Joanne Moran, Director for Water, Environment, Energy Transition and Nuclear at Egis UK & Ireland. “But the success of this vision depends on more than just expediency and infrastructure – it requires people.

“While businesses like Egis are adopting various initiatives to attract and retain talent, such as apprenticeships and graduate programmes, we need a national roadmap to develop the specialist skills required to drive this transition forward.”

Egis believes that a coordinated approach will attract further private investment into the sector, helping the government meet its goal of almost fully powering the country with clean electricity by 2030.

Joanne continued, “Clear directives from the government will not only help bridge the skills gap, but they will also signal that the UK is serious about delivering on its clean energy ambitions. This kind of certainty is essential to unlocking the scale of private investment required to do so.

More than 4,000 companies have committed to cutting emissions, switching to cleaner fuels and embracing greener operations.

However, global emissions continue to rise and could expand an additional 30% this decade, according to McKinsey & Co.

Packaged-goods maker, Unilever, is setting the example when it comes to climate goals, regularly examining the climate work of trade groups it belong to.

Fashion's supply chain efforts

Peter Ford, a former sustainability lead at fashion giant Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M), spent five years attempting to decarbonise a notoriously complex supply chain.

H&M invested approximately US$200m annually into sustainability efforts and reported a 24% reduction in supply chain emissions, thanks to initiatives such as energy efficiency upgrades and the phasing out of coal boilers.

However, while a few companies are making genuine progress, many are passive, waiting for external forces to catalyse change rather than leading it.

The apparel sector, despite scattered success stories, is still on track to increase emissions by 30% this decade.

“It’s a really problematic dynamic where companies hide behind these groups and let them do the dirty work, so they don’t have to say they’re opposed to these things,” says Dara O’Rourke, a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and Former Sustainability Scientist at Amazon.com Inc.

Downsizing in climate targets

The climate regress is not just limited to the fashion sector.

In the last year alone, major corporations across various industries have walked back their climate targets:

BP increased oil drilling while cutting back on renewable investment

Coca-Cola and PepsiCo weakened plastic reduction goals set in 2021

Wells Fargo and HSBC diluted their emissions-reduction strategies

FedEx admitted it will likely miss its electric vehicle procurement target

Walmart acknowledged delays in meeting climate milestones.

This retreat coincides with political developments, particularly in the US, where recent deregulation efforts and withdrawal from international climate accords have created a permissive environment for such rollbacks.

“I am heartened by the alacrity of the retreat and the ferociousness of it, because I think it uncovers the reality that we all need to understand, which is companies aren’t going to save the planet,” says Ken Pucker, a Professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy and Former Chief Operating Officer at apparel maker Timberland.

“The quicker that people understand and integrate that, the better.”

The cost of decarbonisation

Many sustainability projects, like LED upgrades and rooftop solar installations, pay off quickly.

However, true decarbonisation demands far more capital-intensive measures, such as retiring fossil fuel infrastructure or switching to low-carbon, green materials.

“I would happily spend the rest of my life changing lightbulbs and retrofitting buildings,” says Auden Schendler, who ran sustainability at Aspen Skiing Co. and its parent company, Aspen One, for 26 years, before recently stepping down.

“It’s incredibly gratifying, it saves money, it reduces pollution, it makes buildings run better.

""But here’s the only problem: It’s not a solution to the climate problem.”

These investments often carry uncertain returns and clash with corporate cultures focused on quarterly earnings.

Mars as an example is a privately owned food conglomerate committed to halving its carbon footprint by 2030, implementing more than 500 initiatives with an annual cost of around US$500m – approximately 1% of annual revenue.

Even with a 16% emissions cut achieved by 2023, such financial commitment is rare among publicly traded firms under shareholder pressure.

Is voluntary action enough?

The failure of voluntary corporate efforts reveals a critical flaw: without regulation, meaningful progress is unlikely.

Many companies continue to undermine climate policy through trade associations and lobbying:

Airlines: While committing to net zero goals, resist mandates on SAF, which currently represents just 0.3% of their consumption. In Europe, regulators have stepped in, mandating 2% cleaner fuel now and 6% by 2030 however, US carriers oppose rules like these, including a recent California proposal that would have regulated jet fuel for flights in the state.

Hotel giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Marriott International Inc, promise big emissions cuts, whilst supporting trade groups that sue to block energy efficiency regulations for buildings.

Businesses: At a national level, the Business Roundtable, which is packed with companies that trumpet their climate efforts, recently urged Congress to ban climate-related shareholder resolutions.

Trade associations often lobby against environmental policies even when individual member companies publicly support climate goals.

Few companies are known to challenge this misalignment.

One exception is Unilever, which assesses the climate stance of its trade groups and discloses misalignments, pledging to withdraw if necessary.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ddc3440e0b609f58ef3e4e4c7b1c7dff:793f98cf84ac13cfee3fed75829e6cec/chris-leboutillier-c7rwvgl8lpa-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:14.632965

Workhorse Group Inc., a leading American technology company specializing in zero-emission commercial vehicles, has revealed ongoing discussions for a potential merger with a privately held U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer. This move aims to strengthen its position in the sustainable transportation sector amid growing demand for eco-friendly solutions.

Key Highlights

Merger Discussions: Workhorse is negotiating a transaction where the manufacturer would merge into a new subsidiary, with its investors gaining a substantial majority of Workhorse’s common stock.

Stock Listing Continuity: The combined entity intends to maintain its Nasdaq listing, subject to necessary approvals.

Refinancing Plan: The deal includes refinancing outstanding senior secured convertible notes and canceling related warrants through a new convertible note and a $20 million sale-leaseback of the Union City, Indiana facility.

Investor Arrangements: An institutional investor would receive three million new shares, potentially adjusted, in exchange for note repayment without premiums and warrant cancellation.

Exclusivity Agreement: Workhorse has committed to exclusive negotiations for a limited period, barring alternative deals unless fiduciary duties require otherwise.

Uncertainties: No definitive agreements exist yet, and the transaction’s completion depends on stockholder approval, Nasdaq consent, and other conditions.

The potential transaction represents a strategic pivot for Workhorse, which has explored various alternatives with advisors to enhance its market presence in the electric commercial vehicles industry. Under the proposed structure, the manufacturer would integrate into Workhorse via a stock-for-stock exchange, positioning the merged company to capitalize on synergies in zero-emission technology development and production.

A critical component is the potential refinancing, involving entities affiliated with the manufacturer’s majority equity holder. This would facilitate full repayment of approximately $33 million in outstanding obligations under the notes, without redemption premiums. The plan also terminates the investor’s rights to additional notes and cancels all warrants. In return, the investor receives new shares, some with trading restrictions, ensuring a smoother financial transition.

Additionally, the sale-leaseback of the Union City facility is expected to provide essential capital, supporting the merger’s execution. These financial maneuvers are designed to occur alongside the definitive agreement signing, with partial note repayments and warrant cancellations timed accordingly.

Workhorse emphasizes that discussions remain preliminary, with no guarantees of final terms or completion. Factors such as regulatory approvals and market conditions could alter or derail the deal. If agreements materialize, Workhorse plans to file a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), urging stockholders to review it thoroughly.

This development underscores Workhorse’s commitment to innovation in sustainable commercial transportation, potentially accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in logistics and fleet operations. By merging with a complementary player, Workhorse could expand its product lineup, enhance manufacturing capabilities, and drive long-term growth in a competitive market.

Industry analysts view such consolidations as vital for scaling up in the EV sector, where technological advancements and regulatory pressures favor integrated solutions. Workhorse’s focus on zero-emission vehicles aligns with national goals for reducing carbon footprints, positioning the company as a key contributor to greener infrastructure.

Should the transaction proceed, it could reshape Workhorse’s ownership structure while preserving its public market presence. Investors are advised to monitor updates closely, as the outcome could significantly impact stock performance and strategic direction.

In summary, this potential merger highlights the dynamic nature of the electric vehicle manufacturing landscape, where partnerships are essential for overcoming challenges like capital constraints and technological hurdles.

Conclusion: A Structural Shift, Not a Cycle The U.S.-China trade war is rewriting the rules of global industry.","The escalating U.S.-China trade war has created a seismic shift in global supply chains, particularly in the semiconductor and clean energy sectors. With tariffs, export controls, and retaliatory measures intensifying, investors must focus on companies positioned to thrive amid this geopolitical rivalry. The structural shifts now underway favor firms with diversified supply chains, strategic exposure to U.S. incentives like the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the agility to navigate resource bottlenecks.

Semiconductors: A Race to Decouple from China

The U.S. Section 232 semiconductor investigation, launched in April 2025, underscores the urgency to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. As of July 2025, the Commerce Department is evaluating tariffs or quotas on semiconductor imports, targeting critical nodes like advanced chips and manufacturing equipment. China's retaliatory export controls on rare earths—essential for semiconductor substrates and magnets—have further strained global production.

Investors should prioritize companies benefiting from the CHIPS Act's $52 billion in subsidies for U.S. chip manufacturing. Intel (INTC) and Applied Materials (AMAT), which are expanding domestic facilities, stand to gain. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), a key U.S. partner, could see demand rise as firms seek non-China alternatives.

Clean Energy: Battling Rare Earth Shortages

China's April 2025 export controls on seven rare earth elements—used in wind turbine magnets, EV batteries, and defense systems—have exposed critical vulnerabilities. The U.S. and EU now face a 93% drop in magnet exports from China, forcing automakers like Ford to halt production and scramble for alternatives.

The Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion in clean energy subsidies offers a lifeline. Companies like ioneer (INRNF), developing Nevada's rare earth mine, and Albemarle (ALB), investing in U.S. lithium processing, are well-positioned to capitalize on domestic production incentives. Recycling firms such as Redwood Materials (backed by Tesla) are also critical to reducing reliance on Chinese imports.

Investment Strategy: The Dividends of Diversification

The winners in this era will be companies with:

1. Geographic Diversification: Firms like Valeo (VLO) (European auto supplier) and Hitachi Metals (Japan's magnet specialist) are expanding partnerships with U.S. and Southeast Asian suppliers to avoid China-centric supply chains.

2. Policy Alignment: U.S. firms benefiting from CHIPS/IRA tax credits, such as First Solar (FSLR) in solar tech and Piedmont Lithium (PLL) in battery materials.

3. Resource Security: Investors should track companies with access to rare earth reserves or recycling tech, such as MP Materials (MP) (U.S.'s sole rare earth miner) and American Manganese (AMYNF).

Risks and Traps to Avoid

Overexposure to China: Firms like NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), reliant on China for 60% of revenue, face margin pressure if tariffs escalate.

Short-Term Volatility: The June 2025 U.S.-China magnet agreement eased supply chains temporarily, but analysts warn 75% of U.S. license applications remain unapproved. Investors should avoid overreacting to short-term price swings.

Conclusion: A Structural Shift, Not a Cycle

The U.S.-China trade war is rewriting the rules of global industry. Semiconductor and clean energy sectors are ground zero for this transformation. Investors who focus on domestic production champions, resource security plays, and diversified supply chains will be best positioned to capitalize on the $2 trillion in policy-driven opportunities outlined by the CHIPS Act and IRA.

Actionable Picks:

- Long-Term Growth: INTC, AMAT, MP, FSLR.

- Cyclical Plays: PLL, INRNF, ALB (for rare earth price rebounds).

- Avoid: Companies with >30% China revenue and no diversification roadmap.

In May, Gov. Kay Ivey (R-AL) signed a bill into law that establishes an “energy infrastructure bank” to provide loans to eligible utility projects to meet the increasing power demand and accelerate the development of rural areas. The bill, named the Powering Growth Act, also allocates $50 million to two state funds to boost industrial development.

Ohio delivered on lowering taxes, removing subsidies, expediting the permitting process, and other energy reforms through an extensive bill designed to facilitate more in-state electric generation. Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) signed the bill, which will take effect Aug. 14.

South Carolina passed a bill clearing the way to open a new 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant in coordination with Dominion Energy, encouraging the development of nuclear energy to meet the state’s growing energy demands. Gov. Henry McMaster (R-SC) signed the legislation last month, following through on his promise to expand the state’s use of nuclear power.

Republican officials are confident the legislative efforts will help meet their states’ energy consumption and foster economic growth once the laws are in full swing.

“State Republicans are implementing an America first energy agenda that reduces costs for American families and counteracts the Democrats’ restrictive policies that hinder our energy infrastructure,” Mason Di Palma, communications director of the Republican State Leadership Committee, told the Washington Examiner. “We are implementing practical solutions to lower prices at the pump and enhance America’s energy grid, all while promoting economic growth.”

In California, gas prices rose significantly after a gas excise tax increase and updated emissions rules took effect on July 1.

Gas is increasing by 1.6 cents per gallon, bringing the total tax to 61.2 cents per gallon. The state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard rules are expected to incur higher costs, with an estimated increase of 5 to 8 cents per gallon at the gas pump or even a 65-cent hike in the short term.

The latter number was put forward in an October 2024 study published by the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. The study also found that gas prices will increase by 85 cents per gallon by 2030 and $1.50 per gallon by 2035. The study blames California’s LCFS program for the rapid rise in gas prices.

In November 2024, the California Air Resources Board approved the updated emissions regulations to help meet the state’s goal of 30% carbon reduction by 2030 and 90% reduction by 2045. The revised rules are part of the state’s efforts to transition from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles by 2035.

California Republicans took aim at the 65-cent hike to argue against the state’s emissions regulations, while Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and his administration claimed the oil industry is peddling misinformation about the state’s rising gas prices.

California currently has the highest average gas price across the nation at $4.54 per gallon, according to AAA data on fuel prices, although it is gradually decreasing by the day. Hawaii has the second highest at $4.47 per gallon. Most states, however, are experiencing a wave of lower gas prices that hasn’t been seen since 2021; the national average is $3.17 per gallon.

The White House attributes the drop in gas prices to Trump’s focus on gas and oil over renewable energy sources.

While many red states embrace fossil fuels and renewable energy sources, which they see as a way to diversify energy supplies and reduce electricity costs, blue states primarily appear to be defending their clean energy goals. Notably, California is currently retreating from some of its climate policies as it faces political pressure.

In New York, Democratic lawmakers blocked GOP legislation that would have required a cost-benefit analysis of renewable energy and zero-emissions mandates. The bill would also have delayed the mandates for another 10 years to give the state time to assess whether they would increase electricity rates by over 5%.

Republicans blamed the New York State Assembly’s Democratic majority for killing the bill.

The executive branch doesn’t have the same obstacles when reversing climate mandates.

Trump recently phased out subsidies for renewable energy sources through an executive order following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The order directs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar energy and tasks Interior Secretary Doug Burgum with revising regulations that give preferential treatment to such energy sources.

The action is designed to increase the nation’s energy security and independence, which has become a priority for national security-minded Republicans who want to make the United States less reliant on foreign countries for energy production.

China controls over 80% of the global market for components needed to make solar panels or lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Some believe this is intentional.

A recent report from State Armor posits that Beijing pushes “green” technologies to make the U.S. more dependent on China’s energy supply chain and that the foreign adversary co-opts climate change lobbying to force a retreat from fossil fuels. The report cites the Chinese Communist Party’s ties to Energy Foundation China as evidence for its argument.

The tax-exempt nonprofit organizations, led by former Chinese Communist Party official Ji Zou, influence climate policy in the U.S. Zou previously served on China’s climate negotiation team for the 2015 Paris Agreement. Although the organization’s headquarters are in San Francisco, California, its primary operations are in Beijing, China.

EFC is “really operating as an extension of the Chinese Communist Party, and they shouldn’t enjoy this 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations status that’s reserved” for educational, charitable, and religious organizations, American Energy Institute CEO and former Texas State Rep. Jason Isaac told the Washington Examiner. “They’re taking advantage of that and to our detriment.”

The pro-China nonprofit has funded research at flagship educational institutions, such as Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, according to State Armor’s report. It has also funneled at least $12 million to liberal climate nonprofits, like the National Resources Defense Council, since 2020.

EFC also “supported Harvard’s research of creating a hydrogen hub in Texas meant to decarbonize the United States and beyond,” Isaac said. “Decarbonization is a political agenda propagated by the Chinese Communist Party.”

Chinese-affiliated entities have also taken an interest in Texas land over the years.

Houston-based company GH America, which is controlled by Chinese billionaire Sun Guangxin, paid an estimated $110 million to acquire 140,000 acres of land in Val Verde County, Texas. Guangxin purchased 15,000 acres of land to develop a wind farm on, sparking concerns because of its proximity to Texas’s electric grid and an Air Force base.

The acquisition caught the attention of Texas lawmakers, who in 2021 unanimously passed a bill banning contracts between Texas entities and foreign businesses that would grant the latter access to the state’s electric grid and other critical infrastructure.

Expanding its restrictions on China, the Texas legislature recently approved a bill that denies land ownership to foreign entities of concern. The Department of Agriculture plans to implement a nationwide ban on farmland bought by people and companies from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. The state law takes effect Sept. 1.

State Republicans were at the forefront of crafting both pieces of legislation.

GAS PRICES: CONTINUE TO FALL AFTER THE JULY FOURTH HOLIDAY

While blue states like New York double down on climate mandates and emissions regulations, red states like Texas are advancing practical policies that lower energy prices, streamline permitting, and curb foreign influence.

With the Trump administration reinforcing these efforts at the federal level, the Republican Party’s energy strategy is gaining momentum as a viable alternative to progressive climate policies. It offers voters a stark contrast between regulatory restraint and government-sponsored decarbonization in the nation’s complex energy debate.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/windmills.webp,N,,2025-07-14 08:18:00.930829

Nor was there a name for the shared struggle that people of color—along with low-income White communities—were engaged in for access to clean air, clean water, and a livable future.

Fast forward to 2025. The Trump Administration was able to prioritize cuts in environmental program personnel and grants by zeroing in on the words that we once lacked: environmental justice (EJ).

Since the early 1980s, an ever-growing number of people have embraced EJ as an important part of their work, or they have used this vital lens to look at and develop solutions for many of the nation’s problems. With the Trump Administration’s recent extreme and reckless attacks on this work, individuals and organizations seeking to advance EJ are understandably distressed and pondering how they can continue to make progress on issues that are rooted in deep evidence and are dear to their hearts.

A lesson about “small groups making big impacts” from my work during the earliest days of the EJ movement may be instructive in these times.

The spark that ignited a movement

Perhaps the most influential report in EJ history was produced by a small advocacy organization, not a well-resourced university or government agency. The Commission for Racial Justice was established by the United Church of Christ to exercise self-determinative leadership for its Black constituency. Our 1987 study, Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, the first national study on the demographic characteristics associated with the location of hazardous waste sites, catapulted the issue of disproportionate environmental burden to national attention by bringing empirical evidence to bear. It helped to create a whole new field of community advocacy, academic research, and public policy. Dr. Dorceta Taylor, Yale University’s Wangari Mathai Professor of Environmental Justice called this study “the spark that ignited a movement” during the 2025 New Horizons in Conservation Conference.

Professor Robert Bullard, the preeminent EJ activist scholar at Texas Southern University, emphasized that the study was done by a small “Black civil rights organization.” Speaking on the Eyes on the Prize III, sequel to the award-winning PBS documentary series on the civil rights movement, he also recounted how during the early days of the EJ movement, “we had to fight [and] scrape [to] convince the entire policy world that our issues matter.”

Today, Dr. Bullard directs the Robert Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice, which started as a small team and recently began receiving multimillion dollar grants from Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bezos Earth Fund, Houston Endowment, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

A more recent example of small efforts making a big difference is the development of the Washington State Environmental Health Disparities Map by Dr. Esther Min when she was a graduate student at the University of Washington. Her work was part of a statewide campaign led by the statewide EJ coalition Front and Centered.

A legacy of small groups making big impacts

Today, this legacy of “small groups making big impacts” represents an incredibly important lesson as EJ must endure a period of extreme attacks and diminished resources due to the Trump Administration. The spirit of “fighting and scraping,” in Dr. Bullard’s words, has always been a constant for the EJ movement. It is also a timeless lesson as this is neither the first nor the last time that we have dealt with such adversity.

EJ has been called the civil rights issue of the 21st century. Since it works towards shifting power to marginalized communities, the EJ movement will inevitably go through many ebbs and flows. Its ability to make a difference in overburdened and underserved communities will be drastically affected by what happens within the federal government, but its vibrancy has never been predicated on the existence or non-existence of federal policies and programs. The remarkable successes thus far of the EJ movement is the result of advocacy and action by a growing network of communities and their partners throughout US society.

Also, we should not lose sight of the fact that all of us now work with infinitely more assets than we had when I started the UCC study in the mid-1980s. Whereas, for example, the maps in Toxic Wastes and Race were drawn by hand, we currently have Geographic Information Systems-based programs, such as the California Environmental Protection Agency’s CalEnviroScreen and US EPA’s EJScreen tools (the latter taken down by the Trump Administration but mirrored by the Public Environmental Data Partners), that combines and visualizes multiple layers of data in a matter of seconds.

There are numerous community-based organizations focused on EJ, of which WE ACT for Environmental Justice (WE ACT), the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice (DSEJ), and the Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) are but just three examples, along with partners in multiple sectors of society. WE ACT, DSCEJ, EHC, and other EJ organizations regularly conduct public campaigns, webinars, and other activities for people who are looking for a place to get involved in EJ. Local EJ organizations are working on a wide range of environmental, health, climate, economic, and quality-of-life issues in all parts of the country.

In addition, hundreds of universities have EJ courses or degree programs, including a PhD program at the University of Michigan School of Environment and Sustainability, as well as innovative projects like the University of Richmond’s Mapping Inequality Project that digitized the redlining maps from the 1930s. Thousands of peer-reviewed journal articles have been published in virtually all fields associated with health, environment, and sustainability. Established environmental and civil society organizations like EarthJustice and Environmental Protection Network, alongside the Union of Concerned Scientists, have prioritized efforts to address the concerns of the nation’s most overburdened and underserved communities.

EJ laws, policies, or programs now exist at multiple levels of government and in virtually every state and the District of Columbia. California has allocated billions of dollars to address the needs of its most overburdened communities through the Transformative Climate Communities Program and the Community Air Protection Program. New Jersey is implementing the first law in the nation to require mandatory denial of permits for facilities that add greater environmental burdens in already overburdened communities. Chicago is implementing a citywide EJ Action Plan as well as pursuing a Cumulative Impacts Ordinance—named after none other than the pioneering Hazel Johnson.

Environmental justice is here to stay

Not only do these assets exist, but advocates, researchers, and practitioners continue to meet the demand for the increasingly critical work.

For example, the recent study of cumulative impacts in the fenceline communities of Southeastern Pennsylvania by scientists at Johns Hopkins University found that the air we breathe may often be worse than we thought. The study’s authors asserted that we will never truly characterize the true impacts of pollution on human health without addressing this issue.

Or, consider the Climate Safe Neighborhoods project of Groundwork USA, which uses maps and data of past residential segregation practices and current climate impacts to work with municipalities across the nation to build resilience to extreme heat and flooding.

Similarly, UCS’ Looming Deadlines for Coastal Resilience report used the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool to pinpoint areas of concern for loss of critical affordable housing along the coasts. The need for more work like this grows exponentially as our climate crisis deepens.

The EJ movement now benefits from multiple generations of thought leadership. I was gratified to see how the recent Yale New Horizons Conference showcased the work of several hundred young, talented, energetic, and, in many ways, already remarkably accomplished student fellows. The EJ movement’s authentic collaborations across multiple disciplines, institutions, and sectors are perhaps its most important attributes. We now possess the intellectual and social capacity to understand and solve the complex issues involved.

These times will be profoundly difficult and painful to communities disproportionately affected by environmental burdens, but the EJ movement is alive, resilient, and full of people—old and young—who have demonstrated amazing talent and resourcefulness and are fiercely committed, tenacious, and audacious.

To be sure, local communities everywhere continue to fight and win. Witness the recent victory by Alabama community groups to update water toxicity standards. Or the California Public Utilities Commission’s formal designation of the California EJ Alliance to coordinate authentic community engagement for the state’s Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing Program. This work—fighting to ensure that this nation fulfills its promise of ensuring environmental protection and thriving communities for all people—is now more urgent than ever.

Speaking from the perspective of having worked on EJ issues since before they even had a name, I have no doubt that we will continue to make progress.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-0714-guest-blog.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:43.379304

“We consider that a win because they are taking the information that they are learning and applying it to their everyday life.” Challenges remain There are challenges with community air monitors.","DETROIT — As the Rev. Sharon Buttry drives by the Jayne-Lasky Park on Detroit’s east side, she points to the expansive 65-acre park, located just miles from her home.

“I tell people when they take their kids to the park, wear masks,” she said.

Buttry, a clergy leader at the American Baptist Churches USA who is on the board of the ​Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments, is headed just north of the park to the Cadillac Heights neighborhood, a quiet community that now is the epicenter of a bitter fight over a proposed expansion of a concrete facility that area residents fear is dangerously polluting their air.

She navigates her car along a potholed road running between the plant site and a large, grassless lot bordering the plant that used to feature dozens of single family homes that have since been bulldozed. “This used to be a thriving neighborhood,” she said.

While many homes have been bought out and demolished by an entity affiliated with the Kronos Concrete plant, the remaining neighborhood homes have become enveloped by truck traffic and dust generated by operations at the plant. Kronos opened in 2022 and is controlled by the notoriously wealthy and powerful Maroun family, which counts large swaths of Detroit real estate among its holdings. The concrete facility is part of the Moroun-owned subsidiary, Hercules Materials Holdings LLC, which didn’t respond to requests for comment on the air quality concerns and expansion.

On its website the company touts the Kronos facility as a $10,000,000 investment into Cadillac Heights, calling it the biggest investment into the community in decades. It says the site development will include tree plantings and other street improvements, none of which have been done to date.

The facility was under construction before it secured the necessary permits, and now the neighborhood fears the Maroun family is planning an expansion that would expand the concrete mixing and truck traffic, which worsen the air pollution surrounding the plant, the residents say.

For those breathing that air, it is already at dangerous levels.

Air quality testing near the plant by Detroit-based startup JustAir shows that over the past year pollutants known as PM2.5 exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health standards more than 54% of the days. Inhalation of these tiny air pollutants, which are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair, are linked to asthma, heart and lung problems and preterm births. The testing does not prove the pollution spikes are due to Kronos. But Buttry hopes the data will help her push for a plant shutdown.

“This level of pollution is a direct threat to human health,” she said.

The PM2.5 data, which came from a small air monitor set up on the corner of the plant lot, would have been unavailable just a couple years ago. The nearest state monitor is miles away.

“This level of pollution is a direct threat to human health.” -Rev. Sharon Buttry

The air monitor at the Kronos site is one of 100 installed last year across Detroit and surrounding Wayne County by JustAir, a tech company that got its start four years ago and was inspired after founder and Detroit resident Darren Riley developed asthma. The installations were a partnership with Wayne County, which provided funding for the monitors and works with JustAir to deliver the data to residents. Previously in Detroit there were only seven air monitors run by the state, five run by the city.

“We prioritized high-pollution and high-vulnerability areas such as neighborhoods near industrial corridors and schools,” said Warren Evans, Wayne County executive.

The work by JustAir adds to a growing network of organizations and residents deploying air monitors across Detroit, which has long suffered from some of the worst air and highest rates of asthma in the country. More than 1,000 residents are now receiving air quality text alerts from JustAir, according to JustAir chief operating officer Sarah Craft.

“There are so many people who have power to actually do something with this outside of the federal government,” Craft said.

Individuals armed with real-time data about air quality can make informed decisions about when to stay indoors, Craft noted. Others made aware of air quality concerns told Craft they made behavioral changes, such as a father who stopped idling his vehicle when he picks up his daughter from school, and a mother who realized her smoking makes bad air days even worse for her kids.

“And so these are just like teeny tiny things, but it’s behavioral awareness,” Craft said.

The findings from the air quality monitors can’t be used to enforce regulations. And community air monitoring can be imperfect. However, advocates say the ever-expanding monitoring and access to data is shining a light on the worst sources of pollution and empowering residents and local officials.

“It’s time to have discussions with our elected officials and industry polluters … and establish sanctions that will correct behaviors and improve the environment,” said Cinthya Casillas, a Detroit resident who’s on the JustAir Advisory Committee.

Detroit’s air quality problems

The US has seen a 37% decrease in the national average of PM2.5 levels over the past two decades, largely thanks to stricter regulations, but the pollutant remains potent in Detroit. The city received an “F” grade on the American Lung Association’s latest State of the Air report, and was ranked sixth worst city out of 208 for annual particle pollution.

Earlier this year, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) told the EPA that Wayne County was breaking federal standards for PM2.5.

The EPA has a year to evaluate whether Wayne County should be designated as a “non-attainment” area for PM2.5, which would force the county to work with the state and make a plan to reduce the pollution.

The Trump administration said it is reviewing PM2.5 regulations, signaling that it will reduce the health standards. It’s unclear how this would affect areas out of compliance like Wayne County.

Particulate matter — along with other harmful air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone — are near-daily features of life for many residents across Detroit.

“I was asthmatic when I was a child, but I feel like my breathing is getting worse, even though I’m not asthmatic anymore. It’s something that we see a lot in Detroit, especially in southwest Detroit,” said Casillas, who lives in the Hubbard Richard neighborhood on the city’s southwest side, which has the highest levels of air pollution in the state.

Last year Detroit was named the third worst city in the US to live in with asthma by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. The most recent asthma data from the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services found that the rate of child asthma in Detroit was 14.6% compared to the state’s 8.4%.

Air quality information is critical for vulnerable populations, such as people with asthma, said Nelson Roque, an assistant professor and researcher at Penn State who published a study this year on air quality “deserts.”

“Without information, we rely on our best sensor, our nose, but that’s no way to quantify dangers,” he said.

Empowering residents — and local officials

The JustAir monitoring data is also cited in a lawsuit filed by an area resident against the company that owns the land the Kronos plant sits on, Crown Enterprises. Air sampling near the plant shows that PM2.5 readings have increased from an average of 10.3 μg/m3 in 2024 to 12.46 μg/m3 as of 2025, and have spiked to as high as 259.4 μg/m3, “far exceeding safe air quality standards designed to protect human health,” the lawsuit states.

The data show a “significant deterioration in air quality since Crown’s Kronos site concrete operations intensified,” according to the lawsuit.

“At least for the time period that that monitor has been running, the area is not in compliance with the national air quality standards for particulate matter,” said Andrew Bashi, a lawyer at the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center. Bashi is not involved in the lawsuit but has been advocating on behalf of residents who anticipate a plant expansion.

The lawsuit is a counter complaint as Crown Enterprises, which did not respond to requests for comment, originally had sued the resident, alleging he trespassed on company property.

“At least for the time period that that monitor has been running, the area is not in compliance with the national air quality standards for particulate matter.” – Andrew Bashi, Great Lakes Environmental Law Center

In a response to the resident’s counter-complaint, Crown’s attorneys denied all of the allegations of pollution and environmental harm as untrue. The response states that Crown denies it “is subjecting a small neighborhood to severe environmental harm and disruption,” denies that it “has caused environmental hazards off-site,” and denies that the resident is entitled “to any relief.”

Bashi added that the PM2.5 is much higher at the JustAir monitor at the fenceline of the facility than it is at any of the nearby state monitors. The monitor near Kronos showed that the highest day for PM2.5 over the past year was more than 7.5 times the EPA health threshold. “It indicates that there’s something unique about that area,” he said.

This is a major advantage of having these additional monitors, Roque said, as they give more granular information and paint a fuller picture.

Local officials used JustAir data to push back on the state and federal government this year when Wayne County executive Evans sent a letter to state regulators citing the data from new monitors disagreeing with the state’s plan to remove the county’s non-attainment status for sulfur dioxide. Evans said the state monitoring methods “do not fully account for real-world conditions or the cumulative impacts on nearby communities” and provided JustAir data that showed harmful levels of sulfur dioxide jeopardize “the health of residents living in this area.”

Casillas said JustAir data allows her and her family to be instantly alerted to bad air that could harm them. “I use it in combination with my weather app …that also gives me an alert that the air is not good right now, don’t go out,” she said.

Stuart Batterman, an environmental sciences and public health researcher and professor at the University of Michigan and the co-investigator at Community Action to Promote Healthy Environments, a university partnership with communities in Detroit to tackle dirty air, said the proliferation of air monitoring has brought residents a greater level of scientific literacy. “People know about PM2.5 and we don’t have to say exactly what it is anymore,” he said. “People get it.”

The Green Door Initiative, a Detroit environmental nonprofit that works with JustAir on monitoring efforts, this year launched an Air Quality Advocacy Academy, a 9-month training for more than a dozen Detroiters to learn about air quality and monitoring, environmental justice and advocacy. “They can take this knowledge … become community leaders,” said Duaa Ballout, a program manager at the Green Door Initiative.

“People know about PM2.5 and we don’t have to say exactly what it is anymore. People get it.” – Stuart Batterman, University of Michigan

Ballout said the Academy is already having an impact — residents started a petition to stop an industrial pump station in a Detroit neighborhood. “We consider that a win because they are taking the information that they are learning and applying it to their everyday life.”

Challenges remain

There are challenges with community air monitors. Craft said a few monitors have been damaged or gone missing. Many monitors are solar powered and Detroit had a cloudy, long winter. And sometimes there are software bugs.

“Challenges just exist,” she said. “Things go wrong. And there are things that this data can prove and also things that this data can’t prove. It does not measure everything.”

The city has provided air purification equipment to some homes. But at the same time, sources for air pollution in Detroit are expanding.

Michigan’s EGLE just approved an expansion for one of the region’s most prolific polluters — DTE Energy’s EES Coke facility on Zug Island, sitting on the south end of Detroit. The city is also adding a second bridge to Canada — the Gordie Howe International Bridge, named after the city’s famous Detroit Red Wings hockey player — which will bring more traffic pollutants.

“One of the biggest challenges is making sure that air quality data is not just collected but actually reaches and resonates with the people who need it most,” Evans said. “Data is only as useful as the number of people who know about it.”

But residents like Casillas remain optimistic. JustAir has given her and her family and friends information they wouldn’t otherwise have.

“I’m a family advocate for head start programming. And we have a lot of kids who have breathing issues,” she said, adding that the information allows her to know when to keep children from playing outside to reduce their exposure to the air pollutants.

There’s a monitor just a few blocks from her house. “We wanted to have it there because we have the constant traffic of trucks that are going from Canada to Michigan” on the Ambassador Bridge, she said.

The bridge averages about 10,000 vehicles a day, and traffic plays an huge role in Casillas’ neighborhoods’ air problems — Batterman and colleagues attribute about 40% of PM2.5 emissions in the city to traffic and construction equipment.

While the JustAir monitors are giving Detroiters a fuller picture of their air, Roque said “it should be the EPA or state funding these.”

“As amazing as these efforts are,” community air monitoring “passes the burden to the people already affected,” Roque said.",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4333.HEIC-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:46.914947

TERI and SCGJ aim to collaborate on a wide range of capacity-building activities, including the assessment of training needs, development of standardized frameworks, design of training curricula and resources, stakeholder engagement, and support for certification and accreditation. The agreement provides flexibility to broaden the scope of collaboration to include other areas of mutual interest as the partnership evolves.

The MoU aligns with the objectives of the ongoing StoREin (Scaling up Storage in Renewable Energy Integration) project, which focuses on strengthening institutional and human capacity to support India’s growing BESS ecosystem. The Indo-German development cooperation project is being implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) under the umbrella of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The project is being implemented in close cooperation with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India.

With India’s National Electricity Plan projecting a requirement of 47.24 GW of battery energy storage by 2031-32, this collaboration foregrounds the urgent need for a skilled, industry-aligned workforce to support the country’s clean energy ambitions.

About the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) is established as the single state entity with authority to articulate a clear statement of priorities and to focus development and implementation efforts to achieve comprehensive coastal protection for Louisiana.
The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority’s mandate is to develop, implement, and enforce a comprehensive coastal protection and restoration Master Plan.","NEW ORLEANS – Governor Jeff Landry has appointed Michael H. Hare as the new Executive Director of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA), placing a veteran of environmental markets and public policy at the helm of the state’s coastal future.

“We are excited to announce Michael Hare as the new Executive Director of CPRA,” said Governor Jeff Landry. “Michael has years of experience in coastal restoration, and I am confident that his leadership and commitment to our State make him well-suited to lead CPRA.”

Hare is the founder of WILDHARE Solutions, LLC, where he has advised clients navigating the growing environmental markets industry, with a particular focus on compensatory mitigation and coastal restoration. Before launching his firm, he served as Director of Government Affairs and Business Development at RES, leading policy initiatives, strategic communications, and business development across local, state, and federal levels.

With more than two decades of experience spanning public policy, political campaigns, and environmental advocacy, Hare’s career includes senior roles in government, notably as Deputy District Director and Legislative Assistant to former U.S. Representative Charles Boustany. He holds an MBA from Louisiana State University, a master’s degree in U.S. Foreign Policy from American University, and a bachelor’s degree in political science and economics.

“I’m honored to be selected by Governor Landry to serve as the next Executive Director for CPRA,” Hare said. “Building upon the success and momentum of this program, I look forward to working with the coastal community to deliver projects that will protect and sustain our culture and way of life for future generations. We must remain united as a coastal community and maintain our sense of urgency to confront the challenges along our coast.”

While Hare’s appointment has drawn praise for his depth of expertise, it has also raised questions about what direction he may steer the CPRA, which oversees Louisiana’s multibillion-dollar effort to combat coastal land loss.

Observers say Hare’s extensive background in environmental markets suggests the agency may place greater emphasis on economic tools such as mitigation banking, carbon credits, and water-quality trading alongside traditional engineering solutions like levees and marsh creation.

Environmental Assets as Tradable Goods

Environmental markets create a system where environmental “benefits” become tradable goods. For instance, clean water, wetlands, wildlife habitat, carbon storage, or pollution reductions can all be assigned a monetary value.

Many support the concept as a way to bring private investment and innovative financing into conservation. However, some caution that commodifying nature can lead to loopholes or projects that look good on paper but fail to deliver real ecological benefits.

Environmental “Credits” From Elsewhere

Companies or developers who damage natural resources—such as draining wetlands for a construction project—might be required by law to offset that impact. Instead of building the restoration project themselves, they can buy “credits” from someone who has already restored or preserved wetlands elsewhere, a system known as mitigation banking.

Advocates praise mitigation banking for consolidating restoration into larger, more ecologically valuable projects instead of scattered small fixes. Critics, however, say it sometimes allows developers to destroy unique ecosystems, replacing them with less effective or poorly monitored offsets far away.

Carbon Credits or ""Greenwashing""

Another example is the carbon market, where companies that emit greenhouse gases can purchase carbon credits from projects that reduce emissions, such as reforestation or wetland restoration, effectively balancing out their own carbon footprint.

Many environmental groups see carbon markets as essential tools for climate action, especially when tied to high-quality, verifiable projects. Yet there’s skepticism that some credits are “greenwashing,” letting polluters keep emitting without making real emissions cuts.

Water Quality Trading

In water quality trading, companies that discharge pollutants into rivers might pay farmers upstream to reduce fertilizer runoff, because it’s cheaper for the polluter and still improves overall water quality somewhat. Supporters appreciate cost-effective solutions that target pollution at its source and create cooperation across sectors.

But many warn that this form of trading can mask localized pollution problems and shift the burden away from polluting industries, risking uneven environmental protection.

For now, Hare’s appointment signals a potential evolution in Louisiana’s coastal strategy—blending financial innovation with the ongoing fight to save the state’s coastline.

About the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA)

The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) is established as the single state entity with authority to articulate a clear statement of priorities and to focus development and implementation efforts to achieve comprehensive coastal protection for Louisiana.

The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority’s mandate is to develop, implement, and enforce a comprehensive coastal protection and restoration Master Plan.

For the first time in Louisiana’s history, this single state authority is integrating coastal restoration and hurricane protection by marshaling the expertise and resources of the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Transportation and Development and other state agencies, to speak with one clear voice for the future of Louisiana’s coast.

Working with federal, state and local political subdivisions, including levee districts, the CPRA is working to establish a safe and sustainable coast that will protect our communities, the nation’s critical energy infrastructure and our bountiful natural resources for generations to come.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/07/Landry-Appoints-Louisiana-Coastal-Authority-Head.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:15:03.757246

Switching to clean energy is a win for everyone.","In a win for the economy and the climate, clean energy options like solar and wind plants remain cheaper to construct than gas-fired power plants, even without government subsidies, Reuters reported.

The information comes from a June report released by financial advisory firm Lazard. It found that when it comes to large, utility-scale plants, solar farms cost between $38 and $78 per megawatt-hour to build, while a gas-combined cycle plant falls between $48 and $107 per megawatt-hour, Reuters said. (Thanks to larger-scale operations being more efficient, smaller-scale facilities are more costly in both cases.)

In fact, gas-fired power plants are at their highest price point in the last decade, thanks to the country's growing demand for electricity to power data centers and electric vehicles. This has created a backlog for parts, such as turbines.

That ongoing demand means more power plants will need to be built in a hurry — and the current costs could determine what kind of providers choose, shaping the U.S. power grid for decades to come. That's why it's so exciting that clean energy is in the lead in terms of cost.

Wind and solar lead the pack in terms of producing affordable energy for consumers while also creating stable jobs. Not only that, but they don't produce toxic air pollution like oil and coal, so they're healthier for the American public.

The same lack of air pollution makes them better for the climate because they're not producing heat-trapping gases that overheat the Earth and cause unstable and extreme weather. Switching to clean energy is a win for everyone.

Whether utility providers will follow through on this business opportunity is uncertain, but it makes financial and environmental sense.

As Reuters reported, before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law, the renewable energy firm still planned to install up to 1.75 gigawatts of new wind energy capacity by the end of 2026. CEO Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade said it would adhere to this goal even if the U.S. government phased out renewable energy tax credits.

""The renewables bet in the U.S. is here to stay,"" he said. ""In 2024, we installed 2 GW there, and this year we will install 1 GW and up to 750 megawatts in 2026 as planned.""

However, he added that the company's 2027 investment depends on the final version of the legislation.

This news from the Portugal-based firm is encouraging because wind energy investments are crucial in the global move toward a cleaner economy. There are tremendous investment opportunities in wind energy as well as jobs and resilience in communities where installations are based.

Sustainability-focused businesses offer financially savvy investments because they represent the future of energy and outperform dirty energy stocks in long-term growth.

Though there have been bumps in the road for wind energy producers, the industry's momentum remains promising and profitable.

Individual wind energy projects can power hundreds of thousands of homes. Meanwhile, evolving wind turbine technology is making this form of energy more accessible and available.

EDPR is a major player in the wind energy sector, with operations spanning 28 countries across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. While the bill was signed into law July 4, even Senate Republicans, such as Utah's John Curtis, expressed interest in retaining some of the renewable energy tax credits of the Inflation Reduction Act to protect jobs and investors.

Looking ahead, despite ongoing global pressures and with softening market conditions, optimism is anticipated to persist according to the Renewable Energy Market Review 2025 published today by Willis, (NASDAQ: WTW), a WTW business.

The review, titled Next-gen renewables: Risk resilience and insurance readiness, includes commentary on emerging market dynamics across key regions. It highlights the next wave of renewable energy innovations and outlines strategies to navigate growing global uncertainty. Together, these insights deliver a comprehensive analysis of the risks and opportunities shaping the sector in 2025.

Several key trends are explored in this years’ review:

Softening market conditions persist: an oversupply of capacity is intensifying competition among insurers, continuing to drive pricing downward.

Natural catastrophe losses remain a major concern: severe weather events are directly damaging assets and causing significant challenges.

Risk and insurance solutions evolve: innovation in peril diagnostics and broad parametric solutions is helping the market better manage volatility and uncertainty.

Renewable innovation gains momentum: emerging technologies such as kinetic infrastructure, solar-integrated materials, nuclear fusion and gravity-based storage demonstrate the continued interest in reshaping the future energy landscape.

Steven Munday, Global Renewable Energy Leader, Willis Natural Resources said: “While global pressures endure, the next wave of innovation continues to push the sector forward into new and uncharted waters, low carbon power generation doesn’t stop with wind and solar. Different regions face intrinsic risks and opportunities, but the renewable energy sector as a whole can step into the future to deliver clarity and confidence.”

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Asia was the primary driver of the 140 per cent global growth of renewable capacity over the past decade, contributing 421.5GW of new capacity. This is 72 per cent of the global total and bringing its cumulative capacity to 2,382 GW or 53.6 per cent of the global share.

The region continues to lead global renewable energy growth, fuelled by rising energy demand, ambitious net-zero targets and the increasing cost-competitiveness of clean technologies. Countries such as China, India, Japan, South Korea and in ASEAN are accelerating the deployment of solar, wind, hydro and emerging technologies, including hybrid installations that integrate batter energy storage systems (BESS) and floating solar photovoltaics (FPV).

Looking ahead, floating solar is expected to play an increasingly important role in expanding Asia’s renewable capacity. With technological innovation, supportive policy frameworks and competing challenges for land use, optimisation of FPV systems is gaining significant traction. In particular, Asean markets are seeing heightened interest, with developers actively participating and government tenders, indicating strong growth potential.

Sam Liu, Head of Renewable Energy, Willis Natural Resources, Asia, said: “FPV projects face technical challenges, especially regarding floater design and the resiliency of anchoring and mooring systems, particularly in sites exposed to natural catastrophes. Site selection is therefore critical, as it directly impacts the overall system design. Extensive technical studies are therefore required to gather accurate environmental data and ensure the project is engineered for long-term performance and durability.

“In general, while new market entrants have increased overall capacity and enhanced competitiveness in the insurance sector, insurers remain highly technical and cautious. This is particularly when underwriting emerging technologies such as BESS, hydrogen, FPV and larger wind turbine models. Capacity remains constrained by factors such as natural catastrophe exposures and the accumulation of insured assets within specific regions. These will continue to influence underwriting appetite and terms for renewable energy companies in Asia.”",https://eco-business.imgix.net/clients/featured_images/Solar_panels-Renewable_energy_review_2025_lower_res.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:09.470597

As well as the TUC, a number of unions have expressed support for a maximum working temperature, including the GMB and the Workers Union.
Productivity drops in the heat In addition to harming the health and wellbeing of workers, heat also has productivity implications.","Trade unions say the UK government and European Commission must introduce a maximum temperature for workers

The UK and much of Europe are having a summer of heatwaves, with temperatures reaching the mid-30s in the UK capital London and into the mid-40s in southern Europe.

Research published by the UK’s national weather service, the Met Office, in June shows the chance of temperatures hitting 40C have been rapidly increasing and are now 20 times more likely than in the 1960s.

With global temperatures rising due to climate change, UK trade unions are calling on businesses to offer better protection for workers during heatwaves.

Working in the heat, especially physically taxing work outdoors, has a number of health impacts. Heat stress is an “invisible killer”, the UN’s International Labour Organization says. Exposure to high temperatures leads to heat exhaustion, sunburn and heat stroke, as well as longer-term health complications such as cardiovascular and respiratory complications, kidney disease and the exacerbation of other conditions.

The UK does not have a maximum temperature for work, despite having a minimum — 16C for indoor work. But UK health and safety law does require employers to ensure a “reasonable” temperature.

If there is a genuine risk to life, employees can also leave the workplace under section 44 of the Employment Rights Act; for example, if those operating heavy machinery feel unwell.

Shelly Asquith, health, safety and wellbeing officer at the Trades Union Congress, a federation of trade unions, sells Sustainable Views that the law is “quite vague and open to interpretation”. Workers would be better protected if a set maximum temperature was included in law, she argues.

The TUC recommends a maximum temperature of 27C for indoor work.

Some workplaces will always be incredibly hot, such as commercial bakeries or furnaces. But in the same way that UK workers in cold storage facilities are not subject to the 16C minimum temperature, Asquith argues that a maximum temperature rule can function with exceptions.

As well as the TUC, a number of unions have expressed support for a maximum working temperature, including the GMB and the Workers Union.

Prior to last year’s election, the Labour party’s Plan to Make Work Pay recognised that “working temperatures are regularly unacceptably high . . . causing serious health and safety concerns”. The plan said the government would modernise health and safety laws on temperature, but since coming into office the government has been quiet on the issue.

No policies on extreme heat are included in the 2024 employment rights bill, the government’s landmark overhaul of workers’ rights.

Heat-related deaths in Europe

The EU also does not mandate a maximum working temperature, but similar to their UK counterparts, European trade unions are calling for more legal protections following deaths in the bloc during the recent heatwave.

Workplace heat-related deaths in the EU have increased by 42 per cent since 2000, says the European Trade Union Confederation.

Meanwhile, research published by Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Human last week found that of 2,300 heat-related deaths in 12 European cities between June 23 and July 2, about 1,500, or 65 per cent, were the result of climate change-induced warming.

The ETUC is urging the European Commission to propose a binding maximum working temperature, while similar debates are ongoing at the national level in a number of European countries.

France does not have a maximum working temperature but its labour law, the “Code du travail”, requires employers to make sure workers are not subject to extreme temperatures that may damage their health. Italy has similar regulations.

French far-right politician Marine Le Pen has called for a “major air-conditioning equipment plan” in light of the recent high temperatures. Writing on X she said public buildings should be air-conditioned as a priority, such as schools and workplaces.

Italy recently banned outdoor work at certain times of the day when the temperature is highest, due to the heatwave.

Meanwhile, Spain and Portugal have mandated maximum temperatures for work in law — between 17C and 27C for sedentary work and 14C to 25C for physical work in Spain and between 18C and 22C for indoor workplaces in Portugal — and German regulations stipulate that employers start taking protective measures once indoor temperatures reach 26C.

Across the Atlantic, former US President Joe Biden proposed a federal workplace standard for extreme heat, but this has since been removed from the US government website. President Donald Trump’s administration has slashed funding for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which would have managed the standard.

Productivity drops in the heat

In addition to harming the health and wellbeing of workers, heat also has productivity implications.

The 2024 edition of scientific journal the Lancet’s annual health and climate report calculates that 512bn work hours were lost in 2023 due to the risk of heat exposure.

Similarly, research by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics shows that a 1C temperature uplift from the long-term average increases the probability of a UK worker reducing their hours by 9.9 per cent and their effort by 9.5 per cent.

“It’s possible that employers don’t really understand just how much heat is harming workers,” Elizabeth Robinson, acting dean and professor of environmental economics at the LSE, tells Sustainable Views. The most vulnerable workers, such as those with pre-existing health conditions, and those operating in sectors with limited regulation such as gig economy workers are at particular risk during heatwaves, she adds.

Employers may be reluctant to invest in adaptation, even though change could bring significant productivity benefits, says Robinson.

Asquith agrees, telling Sustainable Views that heat exposure has long and short-term productivity implications — workers are less productive when working in the heat and may take more sickness leave due to longer-term impacts. Employers should consider heat as part of their risk assessments, in the same way they would for flooding, she says.

In addition to air conditioning in indoor workplaces, there are many measures businesses can take to make employees more comfortable in the heat, including relaxing dress codes or altering hours to avoid people working in peak temperatures, Asquith says.

A May report by UK think-tank the Autonomy Institute also recommends that employers offer more frequent breaks in hot weather, as well as shaded areas and sunscreen for outdoor workers.

Many heat-related adaptations — “facilities with water and maybe air conditioning” — are relatively cheap for businesses, Carter Brandon, senior fellow at think-tank the World Resources Institute, tells Sustainable Views.

The bottom line is that employees should have a right to work in an environment that does not harm their health, Robinson adds.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/e19e2b54-de49-44c3-8e4f-80593986e87b.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:32.819566

For residential ratepayers in states like Wyoming, Illinois, New Mexico, and Tennessee, the analysis found that electricity costs will rise by more than 15%.

Other parts of the new legislation target IRA-era tax credits available to consumers, such as discounts for home energy improvement projects and electric vehicle purchases. Those incentives are set to expire on the shortest timeline of all of the renewable energy credits mentioned in the new law. Customers wanting to install rooftop solar, electric heat pumps, or home efficiency upgrades have until December 31, 2025, to take advantage of the tax credit, while prospective new and used EV buyers have until September 30, 2025, to claim rebates.

Beyond tax policy, the OBBB Act also rescinds billions of dollars of funding for community-level grants and implementation of a host of climate and emissions-reduction programs with money earmarked for rural communities.

For Sugar Hollow Solar, the cuts will almost surely mean loss of business. Sugar Hollow’s Chief Operating Officer, Clary Franko, said one priority right now is to avoid layoffs among the more than 50 employees who live in the city of Asheville and surrounding rural communities.

“We’ll do our absolute best to maintain stability as a company and keep everybody employed,” said Franko. “It’ll be hard.”

Sugar Hollow is not alone in the challenges it’s facing. Lloyd Ritter is a veteran of federal energy and rural development policy, having worked on Capitol Hill before founding Green Capitol, LLC, a renewable energy consulting firm in Washington, D.C. He told the Daily Yonder that the legislation will negatively affect rural America.

“It’s going to hit rural mom-and-pop energy businesses the hardest,” said Ritter.

Beyond the loss of revenue for small-scale businesses, larger projects planned for development in rural communities are also at risk, a Daily Yonder analysis of Atlas Public Policy data found.

At least 271 wind and solar projects slated for development in rural areas in 40 states are affected by the new legislation’s federal tax policy changes. “New wind and solar projects would have brought investment and job opportunities to rural communities across the country,” wrote Rachel Reolfi, senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, in a statement to the Daily Yonder. “With the new law, many of these projects and their economic benefits are now at risk.”

In order to claim the 30% commercial tax credits for clean electricity production and investment, these planned wind and solar projects must break ground on construction by mid-2026 or come online by December 31, 2027. But for developers of distributed and utility-scale projects with timelines that often span multiple years, this phase-out period is still not much time, despite extending beyond the expiration of the residential credits.

“There will be companies that can’t make it because of project logistics or just lack of support from their investors, or maybe just lack of confidence in the market now,” said Raina Hornaday, general manager and co-founder of Caprock Renewables, a utility-scale developer working across Texas and New Mexico. Texas has many more projects on the line than any other state, with 63 planned solar and wind developments totaling more than 16.6 megawatts of added generating capacity between now and 2031, per the Daily Yonder’s analysis.

Together, the planned wind and solar projects analyzed by the Daily Yonder represent 54.2 gigawatts of renewable generating capacity that, before the passage of the federal budget, were slated to come online in rural communities through the early 2030s. These projects represent enough new generating capacity to power roughly 14 million homes and spur tens of billions in capital investment in their host communities, per estimates made by Atlas Public Policy using parameters from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Amidst the growing need for power supply in the U.S., driven in part by artificial intelligence and energy-intensive data centers coming online, industry experts, including Hornaday and Ritter, told the Daily Yonder they’re concerned about the country’s ability to meet demand under the rollback of renewable energy policy.

“We need more energy, not less, and we shouldn’t be picking winners and losers in that regard,” Ritter said. “Wind and solar have been proven to be rapidly deployable and are making a real dent in the nation’s energy infrastructure.”

As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S.
O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance.
Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance.
""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive.","Nearly every county in the United States has experienced flooding in the past few decades, but just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

It's what experts call the flood insurance gap. Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flooding. And while FEMA aid may be available to help people repair their homes after federally declared disasters, it often covers just a fraction of the costs.

That means when floodwaters come, people frequently are on their own to pick up the pieces. It's a reality communities across the country are facing after flooding hit parts of Texas, New Mexico and North Carolina in the past week alone. In all three states, the floods were caused by extremely heavy rainfall inland — a risk that's growing with climate change. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. As temperatures rise, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time.

One solution: homeowners, renters and businesses can buy flood insurance, which most people get through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change.

Federal flood insurance offers up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for non-residential buildings. People can buy policies that also cover the belongings inside their home, including clothing and furniture. The program is open to anyone who lives in one of the approximately 22,600 communities that have adopted certain standards to regulate development in their floodplains. Porter estimates that people living in more than 90% of U.S. counties are eligible. For people who want flood insurance but live outside of a qualifying community, they would have to go to the private market.

""It's clear that [flood] insurance protects property owners and it protects the communities,"" Porter says. ""It ends up keeping property values from dropping, post-event. It ultimately ends up keeping properties from going into foreclosure.""

In some places, though, federal flood insurance is unaffordable for many residents, and costs are rising around the country.

So, people ""roll the dice, hope [a flood] doesn't happen,"" says Brian O'Connell, an analyst at insuranceQuotes, an online platform where people can compare and buy insurance. ""And when it does happen — and we talk to people who it happens to — it's one of the worst things people ever experience in their lives.""

Some see ""life changing"" flood insurance costs

The U.S. government created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 when private companies stopped offering coverage. The federal program, which is backed by taxpayers, has been chronically in debt, borrowing from the Treasury to pay claims.

Several years ago, FEMA began overhauling how the flood program sets its prices. Now, premiums are based on a home's value, FEMA says, and the flood risk an individual property faces. That's a more granular approach that the government used before. FEMA says one of the goals is to encourage actions that reduce flood risks.

As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S. In Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, for example, where 9 out of 10 homes are at risk of flooding, people are looking at paying more than $5,400 a year for flood insurance, an average increase of more than 500%. That's on top of their regular home insurance costs.

""The guy with a million dollar house, he'll figure it out,"" says Anderson Baker, a retired insurance executive in Louisiana. ""The guy with a $150,000 house, a couple hundred dollars extra a month, or $300 extra a month, that's a life-changing increase in his premium.""

O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance. There are companies that have started to offer flood insurance again, which creates some competition for the federal program, says Porter of First Street. However, private insurers only cover 12% of the market, according to First Street.

For some people, taking on the added expense of flood insurance isn't much of a choice. Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance. Properties that have received federal disaster aid in the past also must be covered by flood insurance to qualify for future assistance. And in Florida, the state-backed insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, has started requiring homeowners that have coverage for wind damage to also buy flood insurance.

If a lot more people bought flood insurance, it would drive down the cost of coverage and could entice more private insurers into the market, says Michelle Osborne, director of the Risk Management Institute at Campbell University.

But as things stand, the cost of flood insurance is often a dealbreaker for people, says O'Connell of insuranceQuotes, especially since many doubt they need protection.

""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive. ""But everybody's in a flood zone. People at the top of a mountain are in a flood zone. They're just in a good flood zone.""

In its budget request, the White House said the U.S. Chemical Safety Board generates “unprompted studies” and duplicates the work of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
With cuts to agencies under Trump, Superior Mayor Jim Paine said communities like his need more investigations and more accountability.
Former board member, safety advocates oppose the move Former board member Rick Engler, who served under President Barack Obama, visited Superior after the refinery explosion.
Cenovus Energy, which owns the Superior refinery, has adopted 9 of the 10 recommendations targeted toward the company and its facility.","Four years after an explosion at Wisconsin’s only oil refinery, federal investigators found a lack of safeguards during a maintenance shutdown led to a 2018 blast that injured three dozen workers and prompted a temporary evacuation of Superior residents.

Now, the board that did that investigation is slated for elimination under Republican President Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget.

In its budget request, the White House said the U.S. Chemical Safety Board generates “unprompted studies” and duplicates the work of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Trump repeatedly proposed nixing the agency in his first term. Decades prior, the board’s creation was almost thwarted under Democratic President Bill Clinton in an effort to streamline the federal government. But more recently, even industry groups have opposed its elimination, as have public health and environmental groups.

With cuts to agencies under Trump, Superior Mayor Jim Paine said communities like his need more investigations and more accountability.

“If the CSB had been better funded 10 or 15 years ago, they might have been better able to educate the refinery in Superior about how to prevent the explosion that ended up happening in 2018,” Paine said. “Had that explosion been prevented, not only would people not have been hurt, but the refinery could have saved millions and millions of dollars in that rebuild. These agencies are good for industry.”

The board has about 50 staff members and a budget of roughly $14.4 million. In the last five years, nearly 500 serious chemical incidents have occurred in 43 states. In a June 24 letter, more than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives urged Trump to reverse his calls to close the agency.

Former board member, safety advocates oppose the move

Former board member Rick Engler, who served under President Barack Obama, visited Superior after the refinery explosion. He called Trump’s proposal a “draconian” move and likened the board’s role to the National Transportation Safety Board in that it examines the underlying cause of incidents to prevent future accidents.

“Many parts of industry, and particularly the safety and health professionals within the oil and chemical industries, recognize the value of the CSB in making recommendations and looking at the underlying causes,” Engler said.

Scott Jensen, a spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, said in an email that the industry trade group appreciates Trump’s efforts to ensure taxpayer money is being spent wisely.

“We value the work of the CSB and want to see it continue, and we will continue to engage with the White House and Congress, so they understand we support the CSB,” Jensen wrote.

The board suffered from a staff shortage during Trump’s first term that contributed to a backlog of investigations that was resolved in late 2023. While not required, Engler said many companies adopt the board’s recommendations. The CSB website states 87 percent of its 1,019 recommendations are closed, meaning industry has typically addressed necessary changes.

Cenovus Energy, which owns the Superior refinery, has adopted 9 of the 10 recommendations targeted toward the company and its facility. It must still address certain actions during its next maintenance shutdown in regard to a mechanical integrity program for a key valve that failed, contributing to the explosion. The refinery didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Engler noted closure of recommendations doesn’t necessarily mean safety changes, but he said it’s clear such changes that are adopted lead to safer workplaces and communities around these facilities.

Jordan Barab, a former deputy assistant secretary of OSHA under Obama, said the proposed elimination comes as Trump also plans cuts to OSHA that include reductions for setting standards and slashing the number of inspections by 28 percent from the last fiscal year.

Barab disputed the administration’s claims that CSB duplicates work of agencies, such as OSHA, that issue fines or regulations, noting the board can examine factors beyond violations. That includes evaluating factors like worker fatigue, management’s safety culture and unclear procedures.

“These are all things that neither OSHA nor EPA does,” Barab said.

Henry Anderson, a former state environmental and occupational disease epidemiologist, said states might lack the sophisticated staff or finances to conduct incident investigations on their own.

“If the safety precautions that they normally recommend aren’t made, then that’s [an] opportunity for continuing more outbreaks of severe injury and illness to workers,” Anderson said.

The board’s supporters say taxpayers get a lot for their money.

“If even one major incident is prevented … the CSB investment is well worth it,” Engler said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/enhanced_closeup-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:49.583126

Leah Douglas reports for Reuters.

In short:

A group of 139 EPA workers who signed a letter condemning Trump administration policies were put on leave, prompting union outcry.

The letter accused the agency of ignoring science and dismantling environmental programs, including those supporting environmental justice.

The employees’ union argues the suspension violates free speech rights and federal protections for whistleblowers.

Key quote:

""These employees engaged in protected speech on a matter of significant public concern, and their actions are fully protected by federal law and our collective bargaining agreement.""

— Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238

Why this matters:

Silencing federal scientists and staff for speaking out undermines transparency and trust in public health and environmental protections. The union representing these employees says the agency’s action reeks of political retaliation. These are the people who sounded alarms as climate policy was gutted, as environmental justice programs were shelved, and as public health protections were rolled back with the stroke of a pen. It's causing many to ask: If scientists and regulators can’t criticize the EPA — the very agency tasked with protecting health and the planet — then who will?

But consistently adhering to the public’s desire not to enhance Illinois’ descent into nuclear power is, in truth, a mark of success, not failure.
Today, Illinois has more nuclear power reactors than any other state, and the accumulation of homegrown high-level radioactive waste has continued.
Nuclear energy is an important alternative for a long-term clean energy future but won’t provide either the energy or the carbon emissions reductions we need right now.
Under HB2967, Illinois students who meet GPA thresholds will receive automatic admission to public colleges and universities.","Regarding the op-ed “Illinois needs the nuclear option for our energy needs” (July 7): Pro-nuclear readers like me who are concerned about climate change applaud the well-articulated commentary by Micky Horstman, pushing for more firm nuclear-generated electricity available 24/7 to run artificial intelligence-driven data centers and provide Illinois with “more reliable power to attract tech jobs and avoid blackouts and price spikes.” Another benefit: Cleaner nuclear power will complement the wind and solar energy being added to the grid to reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels that pollute our air and warm our planet.

Horstman laments the fact that our elected representatives in Springfield could not get across the finish line a bill that would have lifted the remaining moratorium on large-scale nuclear reactors.

But all hope is not lost. In 2023, when legislation allowing small modular nuclear reactors limited to 300 megawatts also failed in the regular session, it was taken up again during the veto session, both houses passed it and Gov. JB Pritzker signed it in December of that year.

Let’s ask our representatives in Springfield to use that same playbook on SB1527 — add it to the veto session agenda and get it passed and signed.

Large-scale nuclear power is a vital tool needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure that Illinois does not become dependent on nearby states to fuel our power demands.

Radioactive waste

Micky Horstman feels that Illinois has failed in not “building a real nuclear power plant” for nearly 40 years. But consistently adhering to the public’s desire not to enhance Illinois’ descent into nuclear power is, in truth, a mark of success, not failure.

Today, Illinois has more nuclear power reactors than any other state, and the accumulation of homegrown high-level radioactive waste has continued. A state’s assembly is representative of the people and what they want. Citizens don’t want radioactive waste near their highways and byways. To understate the fact, we don’t want spent nuclear fuel near our kids, our towns, our neighborhoods or our farms — or ourselves!

— Jan Boudart, Chicago

Free up permitting

Thanks for the op-ed by Micky Horstman. Nuclear energy is an important alternative for a long-term clean energy future but won’t provide either the energy or the carbon emissions reductions we need right now. Climate experts tell us that how well we perform over the next 20 years at reducing fossil fuel emissions will determine how effective we will be at reducing the end-of-century average global temperature. Since Horstman’s first new large-scale nuclear plant probably won’t be seen operating in Illinois before 2050, it’s not a sufficient near-term solution — albeit, it’s an important longer-term consideration.

Wind, solar and geothermal are the near-term clean energy solutions available today that can help us responsibly meet the needs of a country hungry for energy. To ensure we can move quickly to get projects onto the grid, we must enact national permitting reform legislation. Comprehensive permitting reform legislation will help speed up adding transmission capacity, streamlining bureaucratic red tape and addressing judicial reforms to reduce endless court battles. Doing so will assist Illinois in meeting its aggressive clean energy goals.

Readers can ask their U.S. representative to work across the aisle to enact permitting reform legislation to meet America’s growing energy needs in a timely, responsible and cost-effective way.

Helping our students

House Bill 2967, signed by Gov. JB Pritzker last month, will impact thousands of students across our state. As the CEO of Chicago Scholars, I’ve watched the college journeys of thousands of high-achieving students from underresourced communities, and I cannot overstate how needed — and how overdue — this legislation is.

Recently, I sat with a recipient of our program who was at the top of his class, did well on the ACT and wanted to go into finance. But he wasn’t sure he could afford it, whether dual-credit courses would transfer or how to complete the federal aid application. He ultimately enrolled at Illinois State University, a great outcome for him, but his story reflects a broken system that often leaves brilliant students behind.

Every year, we work with hundreds of Scholars: 90% are students of color, and 85% are first-generation college students. Despite the odds, 95% of them matriculate on time, and over 90% persist to their second year. We’ve helped secure more than $700 million in merit-based aid and scholarships. But even with our robust wraparound model, we’re working against structural challenges that no organization can solve alone.

That’s why these new laws matter. Under HB2967, Illinois students who meet GPA thresholds will receive automatic admission to public colleges and universities. This removes ambiguity and boosts confidence. It says to students like the one I’ve mentioned: “You are seen. You belong here.”

HB2967 does more to ensure that those automatic admissions lead to more degrees earned by Illinoisians. Requiring that every Illinois high school assign a federal aid application point person and give students time to complete it at school levels the playing field. Clearer transfer credit standards will prevent the frustration I see every year from Scholars whose credits didn’t count at college. Ultimately, more students will get the aid and credit they have earned.

We are living through a convergence of crises: an affordability crisis, an equity crisis and a trust crisis in higher education. Across the country, attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion threaten progress. But Illinois just did something different. We chose to believe in students and invest in their futures.

Rules of the road

Isn’t it time for the Chicago Police Department and the Chicago Department of Transportation to mount a public information campaign to answer the following questions:

Which vehicles, if any, may use the sidewalks? Which vehicles may use the bike lanes? Are motorized bikes permitted in the bike lanes? Are motorized scooters permitted in the bike lanes? Are motorized unicycles permitted in the bike lanes? When does a motorized bike become a motorcycle? Even with small wheels? What do the various road paintings mean? Where do cars and buses share the red painted lanes? Where do cars and other vehicles share the green painted lanes? And how is the sharing to be accomplished?

And, most importantly, who must obey the rules of the road such as stopping at stop signs and who may use their own discretion?

The rules are unclear and unenforced.

Art Institute service

I do not disagree with the way columnist Laura Washington views the physical look of the Art Institute, which will never change (“The Art Institute is slowly getting back to normal,” July 9). But for me and several hundred fellow volunteers, the museum has profoundly changed.

For 27 years, I did my once-a-week stint at the public contact desks, including at the front and rear entrances. The desks have been removed, and we have not been called back as we had been told at the start of the pandemic.

I miss my time as a volunteer. We were never thanked for our service when it was over.

It was always a pleasure to represent such a fine institution and to help visitors enjoy their visit.

Is that demand realistic?,"Joe Sonka, www.lpm.org, joe-sonka",,,,,https://www.lpm.org/news/2025-07-14/data-center-forecasts-drive-lg-e-push-for-new-power-plants-is-that-demand-realistic,"“Service territory shopping, when data center developers are in conversations with multiple utilities across a number of states, is standard practice,” a Sierra Club motion stated.
State regulators, stakeholders taking closer look at data center forecasts The concern that utilities may be overbuilding power generation due to inflated forecasts of data center demands is shared by credit ratings agencies — a key player in the financing of construction.
Stakeholders are closely following the potential overestimation of data center demand in Texas, which consumes more power than any other state, by far.
The state operator examined how many anticipated data centers actually came to fruition and adjusted the percentage of upcoming projects, cutting the forecasted power demand of data centers in half.
Similar to LG&E in Kentucky, Georgia Power Company is seeking permission to build new gas-fired power plants that will generate more than a gigawatt of power, largely due to a forecasted data center boom.","The largest electric utility company in Kentucky has an expensive plan to construct and upgrade power plants to significantly increase its energy load over the next seven years — mostly due to the demands of new data centers it expects will be built in that time.

Critics say the utility company may be moving too fast, as data centers remain speculative in Kentucky and may not end up consuming the staggering amount of power being forecast. If that happens, they fear current customers may be the ones picking up the tab of the new plants in the form of higher rates.

Kentucky now finds itself in part of the national context of electric utility companies figuring out how to adapt to projections of data center power demand skyrocketing in the coming years. This includes skepticism from some state utility regulators and experts about how realistic those forecasts are, and the risk of spending billions of dollars on new power generation if such data center demand ends up being overestimated.

Louisville Gas and Electric (LG&E) and Kentucky Utilities (KU) filed a case with the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) in February seeking approval to spend $3.7 billion to significantly increase its power generation capacity. Three-quarters of that spending would go to building two new 645 megawatt natural gas power plants — one in Louisville, one in Mercer County — in addition to a new battery storage system in Louisville and upgrades to keep an old coal-fired power plant operating in Carroll County.

The company’s filings with the state’s utility regulator indicate this additional power generation would allow it meet the forecasted 29% increase of seasonal peak demand by 2032 — rising from just more than 6 gigawatts currently, to roughly 8 gigawatts.

Nearly all of LG&E’s projected growth in load demand is due to large economic development projects it expects to come — mostly that of massive data centers, which are facilities housing computer servers that store and process data for services like cloud storage, streaming platforms and artificial intelligence.

In PSC filings and testimony over the past several months, the utility indicated it expected the energy demand of new data centers to reach 1,750 megawatts — or 1.75 gigawatts — by 2032. That’s considerably more than the second phase of the massive electric vehicle battery plant In Glendale that’s expected to use 120 megawatts when it comes online in 2028.

John Bevington, an executive with PPL Services Co., the parent company of LG&E and KU, stated in PSC testimony that “without certainty of available generation and transmission capacity, it will be difficult to fulfill the initiatives of the General Assembly and Gov. (Andy) Beshear in marketing Kentucky to data centers and other large load customers.”

LG&E expects this rise in data center demand due to new statewide tax incentives passed by the Kentucky legislature this year that seek to lure companies to the state, as well as more than a dozen inquiries they’ve received by companies expressing an interest in locating one there — altogether totaling more than 6 gigawatts.

This included two of the massive “hyperscale” data center projects announced early this year — a 400 megawatt project in Louisville and a 600 megawatt complex in neighboring Oldham County.

But the example of Oldham County shows the risks of utilities basing billions of dollars in new power plant construction based on speculation of new data center demand that may or may not come to fruition — a risk that state regulators, utilities and customers all across the country are taking a closer look at.

Critics say inflated demand could lead to ‘stranded asset’

Following a local uproar of opposition to the Oldham County project, the company behind it scrapped its plans for a 600 megawatt data center, instead announcing it would build a 100 megawatt facility on a smaller property. When the opposition progressed into the passage of a countywide moratorium on data center projects, World Hospitality Partners announced it would abandon all plans to build one in Oldham.

Byron Gary, an attorney for environmental advocacy group Kentucky Resources Council, says this highlights the speculative nature of data center load demand that is the basis for LG&E’s infrastructure buildout. If these data centers don’t materialize as hoped, his fear is that the expensive new plants “become a stranded asset that everybody ends up having to pay for.”

Gary says utility companies typically use private equity and bonds to build power plants, and then recoup those funds through charges to ratepayers. How LG&E specifically charges ratepayers to recover the $3.7 billion would have to be formally requested by the utility in a PSC case, which the regulator could approve or deny.

In PSC filings and testimony, LG&E officials have identified 18 data center “opportunities,” in which companies have requested information about the feasibility of a specific site in Kentucky. The utility does not have to name who made the requests, but they are categorized in five different stages based on how close they are to going forward.

Gary noted that none of these are at the final stage of having a signed contract for service and only one — likely the announced Louisville project — was deemed “imminent,” with the company having all of the information it needs, but still finalizing business plans before proceeding. The rest are still in the lower stages of inquiry, suspect and prospect, in which companies are still gathering information and evaluating sites.

Gary said the likelihood of those 17 other data center “opportunities” actually happening “is really uncertain, as we've seen with Oldham County.” He noted that Western Hospitality Partners of the Oldham project and the companies behind the Louisville data center are not the actual end users that would operate it, as they are developers setting up “colocation facilities” that they would then lease out to potential tech companies for use, such as Amazon, Meta or Google.

With real estate developers likely making inquiries about sites in multiple states in order to land an agreement, build a facility or get connected to the grid, he says this is likely inflating the overall forecast of data center demand in Kentucky and throughout the country.

“If we build two new power plants to serve a data center and Pennsylvania manages to get theirs online first, then we could end up being just out of luck and eating the cost of a new power plant for a data center that doesn't come,” Gary said.

This concern of duplicative inquiries was also raised in PSC motions and testimony from the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the case.

“Service territory shopping, when data center developers are in conversations with multiple utilities across a number of states, is standard practice,” a Sierra Club motion stated. “Since (LG&E and KU) appear to lack any barriers to entry to the load interconnection queue, it’s possible that inquiries are coming from customers who have no intention of constructing data centers themselves and are merely attempting to hold a place in line.”

An LG&E map of data center opportunities shows most are located in Jefferson and Oldham counties, along with one in Mercer County, one in Mason County and at least one in Bell County.

State regulators, stakeholders taking closer look at data center forecasts

The concern that utilities may be overbuilding power generation due to inflated forecasts of data center demands is shared by credit ratings agencies — a key player in the financing of construction.

Last year, both Moody’s and Fitch warned that inaccurate load increase forecasts for data centers could create credit risks for utility companies.

Beyond just site speculation, Fitch warned that actual demand may turn out to be lower than projected “because of technological changes and efficiency improvements that lower the power requirements for data centers.” Without tariff schedules, rates and contracts that protect other ratepayers, “there is considerable risk that residential customers may end up paying disproportionately for the significant investments needed to connect the large, new commercial loads.”

Todd Snitchler, the CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, also warned in an op-ed this year that artificial intelligence-driven data center forecasts are succumbing to “irrational exuberance,” risking the overbuilding of power infrastructure that will burden current ratepayers.

Just like fears of digital commerce using excessive power at the turn of the century turned out to be unfounded due to technological advances in efficiency, some expect the same to happen with data centers. For example, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek announced this year that it had replicated other AI models while consuming only a fraction of the energy.

Stakeholders are closely following the potential overestimation of data center demand in Texas, which consumes more power than any other state, by far.

Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the operator of the state’s electrical grid, recently unveiled what its CEO Pablo Vegas called a “sanity check” on power demand forecast driven by the data center boom.

Peak energy demand was forecast to grow from 85 gigawatts to 208 gigawatts by 2030, but ERCOT adjusted this down to 148 gigawatts when it changed its methodology for anticipated growth in data centers. The state operator examined how many anticipated data centers actually came to fruition and adjusted the percentage of upcoming projects, cutting the forecasted power demand of data centers in half.

Vegas said previous estimates were inflated because of the market race of developers attempting to land multiple sites across the country, in the hopes of landing one and preparing it for a large end user, like Microsoft or Apple.

Similar to LG&E in Kentucky, Georgia Power Company is seeking permission to build new gas-fired power plants that will generate more than a gigawatt of power, largely due to a forecasted data center boom. However, Microsoft — which now operates three data centers in Georgia, with plans for more — argues data center demand is inflated by speculative developers, in addition to requesting more reliance on renewable energy instead of burning fossil fuels.

In Ohio, state regulators approved a settlement with American Electric Power Company and other stakeholders that would require data centers to pay for at least 85% of the energy they claim they will consume each month, even if they wind up using less. This is seen as a safeguard in case data centers use much less power than forecast, ensuring they bear the brunt of costs for new utility infrastructure and not other ratepayers.

In Indiana, an American Electric Power affiliate entered a settlement agreement earlier this year with utility regulators and stakeholders on amended tariff terms for data centers. It would apply to a new or expanded facility using at least 70 megawatts — or multiple sites of the same company using 150 megawatts — setting up a specific rate formula for those large load customers.

Gary of Kentucky Resources Council says new data centers in Kentucky could either use the existing large load rate in the current PSC tariff — which does not specifically apply to data centers — or enter into a special contract that would need PSC approval.

He also notes that LG&E has just filed a new case with the PSC to adjust its tariff schedule, creating a new category of “Extremely High Load Factor Service” that resembles portions of the Ohio agreement. The utility also has an ongoing report filed with the PSC last year that outlines its expected energy plans over the next 15 years, which the regulators will make recommendations for.

Even if the PSC does approve a new tariff scheme for data centers that is protective of consumers, Gary warned that may not do much good for ratepayers if data centers don’t actually materialize in the state and fund the recouping of expenses for new power plants — should the PSC give them permission to build them.

“If nobody comes and takes advantage of that tariff, then it seems like there's a possibility that the rest of the rate payers could end up holding the bag for this stranded asset,” Gary said.

Kentucky Resources Council and the Sierra Club also take issue with LG&E plan to build out power with two new gas plants and lengthening the life of a coal-fired plant, arguing that building out more fossil fuel infrastructure instead of renewables will contribute to the escalating climate change crisis.

There is a public comment hearing in Louisville on Monday for the LG&E case requesting PSC approval to build out $3.7 billion of power generating infrastructure.

In Louisiana, natural gas—a planet-heating fossil fuel—is now, by law, considered “green energy” that can compete with solar and wind projects for clean energy funding. The law, signed by Republican Governor Jeff Landry last month, comes on the heels of similar bills passed in Ohio, Tennessee, and Indiana. What the bills have in common—besides an “updated definition” of a fossil fuel as a clean energy source—is language seemingly plucked straight from a right-wing think tank backed by oil and gas billionaire and activist Charles Koch.

Louisiana’s law was based on a template created by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative organization that brings legislators and corporate lobbyists together to draft bills “dedicated to the principles of limited government, free markets and federalism.” The law maintains that Louisiana, in order to minimize its reliance on “foreign adversary nations” for energy, must ensure that natural gas and nuclear power are eligible for “all state programs that fund ‘green energy’ or ‘clean energy’ initiatives.”

But natural gas, also known as methane gas, is no more natural than any other fossil fuel. Its primary ingredient is methane, an intense heat-trapping gas that is far more potent than the carbon pollution produced by coal and oil, though it doesn’t stay in the atmosphere as long.

It’s often marketed as a “bridge fuel”—a less harmful fossil fuel that can be used as communities transition away from coal—but studies have found that over the long term, the planet-warming impact of the natural gas industry may be equivalent to that of coal. That’s because gas pipelines often leak; according to an Environmental Defense Fund analysis, natural gas pipelines in the US allow between 1.2 million and 2.6 million tons of methane to escape into the atmosphere each year.

Louisiana state Rep. Jacob Landry first introduced a near-identical bill to the model posted on ALEC’s website and to the other bills that have passed in Ohio, Tennessee, and Indiana. (The Washington Post reported in 2023 that ALEC was involved in Ohio’s bill; ALEC denies involvement.) Landry, who represents a small district in the southern part of the state, is the recipient of significant fossil fuel-industry funding—and he co-owns two oil and gas consulting firms himself. During his campaign for the state Legislature, Landry received donations from at least 15 fossil-fuel-affiliated companies and PACs, including ExxonMobil (which has also funded ALEC) and Phillips 66. Those donations alone totaled over $20,000.

Landry did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ALEC did not get back to Grist in time for publication.

While Louisiana has one of the least reliable grids in the country, that lack of reliability is in large part due to the state’s reliance on natural gas, which provides most of its electricity, according to a 2025 report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office. “Best practices have found that gas plants are susceptible to large-scale failures during extreme weather,” the auditors wrote. “Diversifying the energy sources used for electricity generation is a priority.”

Bills that benefit both the fossil fuel industry and the individual lawmakers who introduce them aren’t exactly a new genre in Louisiana, said Laura Peterson, a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. What’s less standard is that this one is dressed up in climate-friendly language.

“Louisiana is a classic example of a captured state,” Peterson said. “Their state economy is just so dependent on fossil fuels and petrochemicals.” (The amount of money the fossil fuel industry brings to Louisiana’s people, though, has been on the decline since the turn of the century.)

The state accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s natural gas production and holds about 6 percent of U.S. natural gas reserves. Natural gas is already used to generate about three-quarters of the state’s electricity, and building out more pipeline projects to carry liquefied natural gas, or LNG, won’t necessarily make electricity bills cheaper for residents, Peterson said.

“Building LNG infrastructure is not going to lower anyone’s energy prices in the short term,” since it takes many years to build a pipeline, Peterson said. “And there’s a lot of research that shows that overreliance on gas leaves power grids vulnerable to extreme weather, which Louisiana has a lot of.”

Jeffrey Clark, president of the Louisiana Advanced Power Alliance—an industry group representing both renewable and fossil fuel energy companies and investors—testified in opposition to the bill in early June.

“This legislation is being promoted as a solution to Louisiana’s reliability challenges. But with all due respect, it is a solution in search of a problem,” Clark said. “We support fossil fuels as a key part of the nation’s energy mix, but codifying them as the only acceptable path forward dismisses a growing body of evidence that grid reliability depends on resource diversity.”

Fossil fuel advocacy groups lauded the move. Larry Behrens of the nonprofit Power the Future wrote that the legislation turns Louisiana into an “energy sanctuary state,” taking “a direct shot at the China-backed solar and wind lobby.”

Reclassifying natural gas as “green” energy means that proposed natural gas pipelines may be able to access funding that would otherwise have gone to new solar or wind projects; it may also make natural gas companies more appealing to environmentally conscious investors.

ALEC, the right-wing think tank that provided the template language for Landry’s bill, noted in a press release that resolutions like this could pave the way for more AI data centers in the state, too. “Redefining ‘green energy’ allows utilities to continue using natural gas while fulfilling state ‘green energy’ or ‘clean energy’ initiatives,” ALEC staffer Mark Lucas wrote.

Over the years, ALEC has succeeded in getting laws that benefit fossil fuel companies passed across the country. Recently the group, which was founded in the 1970s, has helped draft legislation criminalizing grassroots protest against pipelines, gas terminals, and other fossil fuel infrastructure—versions of that bill had passed in 17 states by 2022. Its members have also drafted bills aiming to punish economic boycotts of the oil industry. And there are currently 114 different model policies related to energy on ALEC’s website, 23 of which specifically address “green energy.”

“It’s classic greenwashing, right?” said Peterson of the new Louisiana law—using the language of sustainability to describe an activity that’s actually not sustainable at all. “The intent of these laws is to allow the build-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, which will perpetuate the use of fossil fuels for decades to come.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250711-gasplant.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-14 07:20:37.762008

If highly reactive hydrofluoric acid (HF) was released from the Delaware County refinery, it could form a ground-hugging cloud extending up to 17 miles and affecting as many as 1.9 million people in addition to delicate ecosystems nearby. HF attacks the human body causing burns, organ damage and death, a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claims.

The Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California-based Communities for a Better Environment are suing the EPA in federal court, asking a judge to order the agency to reassess its regulations on the chemical.

Filed last Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the suit follows the EPA’s rejection of a petition by the groups asking the agency to eliminate unreasonable risks from the use of HF at oil refineries. An EPA spokesperson said the agency has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation.

HF is used to increase the octane rating of gasoline during the refining process. The groups argue in their lawsuit that more than 40 oil refineries across the country still use HF despite the availability of safer alternatives. The chemical also presents a hazard as it is transported by truck and rail from the only plant where it is manufactured, in Louisiana.

“Needlessly risking release of this extremely hazardous chemical in our densely-packed region where so many people could be injured or killed is reckless. All the other refineries in Pennsylvania manage to use safer alternatives,” Clean Air Council Executive Director Alex Bomstein said in a statement.

Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Airlines, is not a defendant in the lawsuit, which also details the risks to populations surrounding refineries that use HF in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas.

A spokesperson for Monroe said the safe operation of the refinery is of paramount importance and the plant’s alkylation unit, where HF is used, is constantly inspected. The company has invested millions of dollars in safety systems for the unit, spokesperson Matt McGlaughlin said.

“Monroe Energy has a robust safety culture and a strong safety record that reflects this, having received numerous accolades for our safety performance over the years,” McLaughlin said, noting they include awards from the state and industry groups.

Delaware County spokesperson Ryan Herlinger said the county’s Hazardous Materials Response Team is prepared to respond to a release of HF from the Monroe Energy refinery.

“Delaware County takes the risks associated with HF seriously and maintains the resources, training, and protocols necessary to respond effectively and support our communities,” Herlinger said.

Composed of a single hydrogen and a single fluorine atom, both highly reactive elements by themselves, HF can cause respiratory problems and skin burns in lower concentrations. At higher levels, the chemical can cause gruesome and often fatal injuries by dissolving skin, muscle and bone.

“Poison acid clouds engulfing refinery communities and transit corridors sounds like a horror movie, but it’s a real possibility as long as EPA refuses to engage,” Matthew Tejada, senior vice president of environmental health at NRDC, said.

The lawsuit lists numerous releases of HF that caused injuries, including a 1987 incident in which a cloud of acid blanketed a Texas neighborhood. But south Philadelphia was the site of a near miss that could have had catastrophic consequences.

In the wee hours of June 21, 2019, a fire and massive explosion rocked the Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery, hurling massive pieces of equipment hundreds of yards, with some landing on the other side of the Schuylkill River. More than 5,000 pounds of HF were released along with propane and other refining byproducts.

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found the cause of the blast was a 50-year-old section of pipe that ruptured and released liquid propane into the alkylation unit where HF was being used. The Trump administration’s budget for next year eliminates funding for the board, effectively shutting it down.

“A heroic worker was able to divert most of the refinery’s HF inventory — 339,000 pounds — to underground tanks, helping prevent an even greater catastrophe,” the lawsuit says, noting the incident injured five refinery workers and one firefighter, but damaged the plant so badly it never reopened.

Annie Fox, a Clean Air Council employee who works with residents in Trainer, Marcus Hook and other communities around the Monroe Energy plant, said the plant has health impacts on people who live “literally across the street.”

On Thursday, people in Delaware County reported a strong odor of sulfur or gasoline after a power failure forced an emergency shut down of parts of the plant. A towering flame and column of black smoke were emitted from the refinery’s flare stack, videos on social media showed.

“That is one of the reasons why Trainer is representative of the refineries across the country that still use HF,” Fox said.

She added that the recent closure of Crozer-Chester Medical Center means that the nearest emergency room is at least 20 minutes away and people say they have little guidance on what to do in a serious emergency.

“They’re not putting out emergency response plans. They’re not educating the medical personnel,” Fox said. “One resident who has lived there her entire life said they used to do very serious drills if there was an explosion there.”

According to the NRDC, the Trainer refinery has had five releases of HF since 1990, although only one happened since Monroe Energy took ownership of the plant in 2012 and none affected members of the public. In 2019, eight employees were exposed to HF during maintenance; five required hospitalization.

McGlaughlin, the Monroe Energy spokesperson, said the company has worked closely for years with the Delaware County Local Emergency Planning Committee and hospitals to provide information about what to do in the event of an HF release.

The county haz-mat team is certified by the state to handle highly hazardous chemical releases and equipped with specialized tools to detect such materials, including HF. Members of the team receive specialized training in HF response and carry a supply of the front-line treatment for exposure, Herlinger, the county spokesperson, said.

Monroe Energy also conducts joint training with local fire companies, including hazardous materials response.

“We work closely with local first responders in the Delaware Valley, a number of whom are also team members here at the refinery, who in turn share their learnings and knowledge with responders in their communities as well,” McGlaughlin said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_1203-1024x7681752486872.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=1gTBGw1N,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:36.363785

DOE to halt wind transmission line: US senator

Houston, 11 July (Argus) — President Donald Trump's administration has pledged to halt an 800-mile transmission line designed to deliver wind power from Kansas to eastern states, according to a US senator. US energy secretary Chris Wright has said he ""will be putting a stop"" to the Grain Belt Express transmission line, senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) said on Thursday via the X social media platform. Hawley has made repeated calls for the Department of Energy (DOE) to cancel a $4.9bn conditional loan awarded to the project in the waning days of former president Joe Biden's administration. The senator has called the project an ""elitist land grab harming Missouri farmers and ranchers"". Whether Wright pledged to rescind the loan or take other action to stop work on Grain Belt Express was not immediately clear from Hawley's statement. Neither the senator's office nor DOE immediately responded to requests for additional information. Hawley's statement is ""bizarre"", according to Invenergy, the Chicago-based developer behind the project. The company said that the transmission line has already received approvals from all four states that it will traverse, acquired 1,500 agreements with landowners tied to construction and announced ""significant"" supply chain agreements for materials sourced domestically. ""Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in US history, which is already approved by four states and is aligned with the president's energy dominance agenda,"" the company said. The Grain Belt Express would deliver wind power from Kansas to converter stations in Missouri and Indiana, with the Missouri station connecting to grids overseen by the Associated Electric Cooperative and Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), while the Indiana station links with the PJM Interconnection. Invenergy plans to build the project in two phases, with the first delivering 2,500MW into Missouri and the second ferrying another 2,500MW to the PJM region, which includes the District of Columbia and 13 states in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic. DOE in November 2024 awarded the project a conditional loan of up to $4.9bn to help finance the initial stage as part of Biden's larger push to decarbonize the electricity sector. Invenergy intends to start construction on the first phase next year. Ultimately, the line would supply 15mn MWh/yr to Missouri, with 60pc of the capacity allocated to MISO and the remainder to the Associated Electric Cooperative. Another 15mn MWh/yr would flow into the PJM markets. Altogether, the line would supply enough electricity to cover the demand of more than 2.8mn households. Landowner groups in Missouri have long targeted the Grain Belt Express, but have failed to stymie the project through a challenge to its use of eminent domain .

Kalamazoo County Sheriff investigating hate crime against Galesburg couple

A couple from Galesburg were on their honeymoon last week when someone carved anti-Black and anti-Jewish words and symbols on their truck, which was parked in their driveway. The tires were slashed and a liquid was poured on it that damaged the paint. The victims say they won’t be intimidated, and neighbors have spoken up with support. The Sheriff’s Office says they don’t believe it was simply vandalism. [WWMT]

Kalamazoo airport gets $14.2 million FAA grant to expand capacity

The Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport said it received a grant from the Federal Aviation Administration for projects that will improve safety and reduce flight delays and weight restrictions on airplanes. The $14.164 million grant includes extension of a runway, by 450 feet, as well as a taxiway, and upgrades to lighting, runway markings, technology, and fencing. Work will begin next spring and end in the fall, 2026. Currently Delta Air Lines and American Airlines operate flights to the airport to and from Detroit and Chicago. [MLive, WOODTV]

The fate of federal funding for extreme weather projects in Kalamazoo County remain in limbo

The $18.9 million for projects to increase energy efficiency and solar power in homes and community centers as well as job training in Kalamazoo County remains on hold. It was part of an $87.9 million award last year to similar projects in Detroit, Benton Harbor, and 12 Native American tribes in the state. Two months ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which gave the grant, said it has been canceled. Kalamazoo County’s grant included $12.1 million for 300 houses as well as community centers to receive energy efficiency upgrades and add solar power and supporting equipment. Those community centers would be used as emergency shelters during extreme weather as well. $2.1 million of the grant was to train contractors in trades and construction jobs associated with the work. The county, with the backing of the Michigan Attorney General’s office, has filed a lawsuit against the EPA arguing that the president can’t cut funds authorized by Congress. [Bridge Michigan]

Delaware County spokesperson Ryan Herlinger said the county’s Hazardous Materials Response Team is prepared to respond to a release of HF from the Monroe Energy refinery.
“Delaware County takes the risks associated with HF seriously and maintains the resources, training, and protocols necessary to respond effectively and support our communities,” Herlinger said.
Members of the team receive specialized training in HF response and carry a supply of the front-line treatment for exposure, Herlinger, the county spokesperson, said.
Monroe Energy also conducts joint training with local fire companies, including hazardous materials response.","Sandwiched between the Delaware River and closely spaced homes, the Monroe Energy oil refinery in Trainer exemplifies the need for better regulation of a dangerous chemical used around the country to produce high-octane gasoline, environmental groups said.

If highly reactive hydrofluoric acid (HF) was released from the Delaware County refinery, it could form a ground-hugging cloud extending up to 17 miles and affecting as many as 1.9 million people in addition to delicate ecosystems nearby. HF attacks the human body causing burns, organ damage and death, a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claims.

The Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California-based Communities for a Better Environment are suing the EPA in federal court, asking a judge to order the agency to reassess its regulations on the chemical.

Filed last Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the suit follows the EPA’s rejection of a petition by the groups asking the agency to eliminate unreasonable risks from the use of HF at oil refineries. An EPA spokesperson said the agency has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation.

HF is used to increase the octane rating of gasoline during the refining process. The groups argue in their lawsuit that more than 40 oil refineries across the country still use HF despite the availability of safer alternatives. The chemical also presents a hazard as it is transported by truck and rail from the only plant where it is manufactured, in Louisiana.

“Needlessly risking release of this extremely hazardous chemical in our densely-packed region where so many people could be injured or killed is reckless. All the other refineries in Pennsylvania manage to use safer alternatives,” Clean Air Council Executive Director Alex Bomstein said in a statement.

Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Airlines, is not a defendant in the lawsuit, which also details the risks to populations surrounding refineries that use HF in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas.

A spokesperson for Monroe said the safe operation of the refinery is of paramount importance and the plant’s alkylation unit, where HF is used, is constantly inspected. The company has invested millions of dollars in safety systems for the unit, spokesperson Matt McGlaughlin said.

“Monroe Energy has a robust safety culture and a strong safety record that reflects this, having received numerous accolades for our safety performance over the years,” McLaughlin said, noting they include awards from the state and industry groups.

Delaware County spokesperson Ryan Herlinger said the county’s Hazardous Materials Response Team is prepared to respond to a release of HF from the Monroe Energy refinery.

“Delaware County takes the risks associated with HF seriously and maintains the resources, training, and protocols necessary to respond effectively and support our communities,” Herlinger said.

Composed of a single hydrogen and a single fluorine atom, both highly reactive elements by themselves, HF can cause respiratory problems and skin burns in lower concentrations. At higher levels, the chemical can cause gruesome and often fatal injuries by dissolving skin, muscle and bone.

“Poison acid clouds engulfing refinery communities and transit corridors sounds like a horror movie, but it’s a real possibility as long as EPA refuses to engage,” Matthew Tejada, senior vice president of environmental health at NRDC, said.

The lawsuit lists numerous releases of HF that caused injuries, including a 1987 incident in which a cloud of acid blanketed a Texas neighborhood. But south Philadelphia was the site of a near miss that could have had catastrophic consequences.

In the wee hours of June 21, 2019, a fire and massive explosion rocked the Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery, hurling massive pieces of equipment hundreds of yards, with some landing on the other side of the Schuylkill River. More than 5,000 pounds of HF were released along with propane and other refining byproducts.

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found the cause of the blast was a 50-year-old section of pipe that ruptured and released liquid propane into the alkylation unit where HF was being used. The Trump administration’s budget for next year eliminates funding for the board, effectively shutting it down.

“A heroic worker was able to divert most of the refinery’s HF inventory — 339,000 pounds — to underground tanks, helping prevent an even greater catastrophe,” the lawsuit says, noting the incident injured five refinery workers and one firefighter, but damaged the plant so badly it never reopened.

Annie Fox, a Clean Air Council employee who works with residents in Trainer, Marcus Hook and other communities around the Monroe Energy plant, said the plant has health impacts on people who live “literally across the street.”

On Thursday, people in Delaware County reported a strong odor of sulfur or gasoline after a power failure forced an emergency shut down of parts of the plant. A towering flame and column of black smoke were emitted from the refinery’s flare stack, videos on social media showed.

“That is one of the reasons why Trainer is representative of the refineries across the country that still use HF,” Fox said.

She added that the recent closure of Crozer-Chester Medical Center means that the nearest emergency room is at least 20 minutes away and people say they have little guidance on what to do in a serious emergency.

“They’re not putting out emergency response plans. They’re not educating the medical personnel,” Fox said. “One resident who has lived there her entire life said they used to do very serious drills if there was an explosion there.”

According to the NRDC, the Trainer refinery has had five releases of HF since 1990, although only one happened since Monroe Energy took ownership of the plant in 2012 and none affected members of the public. In 2019, eight employees were exposed to HF during maintenance; five required hospitalization.

McGlaughlin, the Monroe Energy spokesperson, said the company has worked closely for years with the Delaware County Local Emergency Planning Committee and hospitals to provide information about what to do in the event of an HF release.

The county haz-mat team is certified by the state to handle highly hazardous chemical releases and equipped with specialized tools to detect such materials, including HF. Members of the team receive specialized training in HF response and carry a supply of the front-line treatment for exposure, Herlinger, the county spokesperson, said.

Monroe Energy also conducts joint training with local fire companies, including hazardous materials response.

“We work closely with local first responders in the Delaware Valley, a number of whom are also team members here at the refinery, who in turn share their learnings and knowledge with responders in their communities as well,” McGlaughlin said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1203-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:19:40.108364

This is because of the reconciliation bill passed earlier this month, which states that solar PV and wind projects will need to begin construction within 12 months of the bill’s enactment in order to retain its “commence construction” date as a safe harbour to receive investment tax credits and production tax credits.
Moreover, on a 10-year basis, solar PV installations are forecast to slow down by 17% compared to WoodMac’s previous base-case forecast.
With the removal of the tax credits, the installed volume could be as low as 375GWac in the next ten years.

This is because of the reconciliation bill passed earlier this month, which states that solar PV and wind projects will need to begin construction within 12 months of the bill’s enactment in order to retain its “commence construction” date as a safe harbour to receive investment tax credits and production tax credits.

This would allow projects to maintain eligibility until the 2030s, while projects beginning construction after 4 July 2026 will need to be commissioned by the end of 2027 in order to get access to the incentives. However, whether even these terms will be available to developers remains to be seen as US president Donald Trump signed an executive order days later seeking to limit access to solar deployment subsidies, which would target solar PV and wind projects that begin construction within that 12-month period.

Not only will solar PV and wind projects need to start construction in the coming months in order to receive the tax incentives, but they will also be impacted by the foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirement. This will limit access to equipment from prohibited foreign entities such as Chinese-backed manufacturers, explained WoodMac. This will come into play for projects that begin construction starting from 1 January 2026.

Moreover, on a 10-year basis, solar PV installations are forecast to slow down by 17% compared to WoodMac’s previous base-case forecast. With the removal of the tax credits, the installed volume could be as low as 375GWac in the next ten years.

Regarding the fate of clean energy manufacturing, David Brown, director, energy transition research at Wood Mackenzie, said: “Without permitting reform, new large load tariffs and domestic technology innovation, the US will risk the edge it has in the global AI race.

“The early sunset of manufacturing tax credits will lower future energy demand from clean energy manufacturing, while delays to new supply could slow data center rollouts nationwide as facilities compete for scarce grid capacity.”

Energy storage affected by FEOC

The growth of energy storage in the coming years will also be affected, despite its tax credits remaining for longer than solar PV and wind. According to Wood Mackenzie, the central problem for energy storage be the FEOC requirement, due to the sector’s heavy reliance on Chinese supply chains.

As is expected to happen with PV, this could drive a rush of energy storage projects starting construction in the upcoming months, as Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF), told our sister site, Energy-storage.news.

Furthermore, the looming threat of more tariffs imposed to several countries could also have an impact on the supply chain. According to Ben Boucher, a senior analyst in Wood Mackenzie’s Market Intelligence Group, the most consequential change is the increased copper tariff (up to 50%), with wires and cable manufacturing among the hardest hit. That tariff alone could drive US prices of copper up by more than 8%.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/solar-panels-and-wind-turbines-Image_Gerry-Machen-via-flickr.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 06:10:58.743416

Jeremy Lindenfeld reports for Capital & Main.

In short:

Trump’s administration is considering reforms that would make it harder for states to qualify for FEMA assistance and cap how much of the recovery costs the agency will cover, threatening California’s ability to respond to worsening natural disasters.

FEMA has already rescinded nearly $900 million in disaster-preparedness grants, including wildfire prevention funds in Napa County, and delayed disbursing key emergency management grants with no public explanation.

With California’s $12 billion budget deficit and rising disaster frequency, state and local officials say they can’t replace lost federal funding, even as some FEMA payouts for individuals remain minimal or are simply denied.

Key quote:

“They’re just cutting these projects even though they have proven benefit cost analyses in place.”

— Laurie Schoeman, senior adviser on climate resilience to former President Joe Biden

Why this matters:

Climate-fueled disasters are growing more frequent, intense, and expensive. In California, wildfires now destroy entire neighborhoods, displace tens of thousands, and strain public systems for years after the flames are out. FEMA has long helped states shoulder the burden, covering a major share of disaster response and recovery costs.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.wzzm13.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:46.584407

The article also presents the evaluation of 37 million records of analytical limits from the US database.
Analytical limits describe the lowest concentration at which a chemical can be found in the environment.
For inorganic and most organic chemicals, the analytical limits are low enough to detect them at all concentrations that affect aquatic organisms.
As a result, some concentration ranges that are associated with risks for aquatic organisms cannot be captured, and potential effects on the ecosystem remain undetected.","Several hundred thousand chemicals are considered as potentially environmentally relevant. Scientists from the RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau in Germany show that monitoring data for surface waters are only available for a very small fraction of these chemicals. In their article, published in the latest issue of Science, the authors also demonstrate that the environmental risks of highly toxic chemicals might be overlooked, because these chemicals affect ecosystems at concentrations that cannot be detected on a regular basis.

“We analyzed a very extensive US database for the presence of chemicals in the US surface waters and compared it with the toxicity data of these chemicals for aquatic organisms, such as plants, insects or fish”, says Ralf Schulz, environmental scientist from Landau and senior author of the article. “This way, we could assess how the dataset reflects chemical risks of the last six decades.”

According to the article, the major problem for comprehensive risk evaluations today is the insufficient chemical coverage of monitoring. Only less than 1% of the 300,000 chemicals, which the US Environmental Protection Agency lists as potentially environmentally relevant, has been in fact monitored.

The article reveals interesting patterns by linking 64 million monitoring records for 1,900 chemicals, 300,000 sites and the time span from 1958 to 2019 with toxicity thresholds indicating risks for aquatic organisms. For example, it shows increased numbers of threshold exceedances throughout the US in 1970s for a relatively small number of chemicals, including heavy metals, such as copper, lead and zinc. But it also shows that the subsequent measures for emission control led to a decline of threshold exceedances of these inorganic chemicals.

The article reveals interesting patterns by linking 64 million monitoring records for 1,900 chemicals, 300,000 sites and the time span from 1958 to 2019 with toxicity thresholds indicating risks for aquatic organisms

In the 2000s, another peak of threshold exceedances can be observed, but this time spread out over a much larger number of mainly organic chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. The number of the exceedances has dropped since then, too. However, because the monitoring of these chemicals was stopped, it is not possible to state whether the environmental risks of these chemicals decreased as well. “If you stop monitoring a problematic chemical, you lose the capability to track its actual presence in the environment. Without the monitoring information, it becomes very hard to understand how potential risks are developing”, comments Sascha Bub, environmental scientist and lead author of the article.

The article also presents the evaluation of 37 million records of analytical limits from the US database. Analytical limits describe the lowest concentration at which a chemical can be found in the environment. For inorganic and most organic chemicals, the analytical limits are low enough to detect them at all concentrations that affect aquatic organisms. However, for some pesticides, and especially some insecticides, typical analytical limits are not sufficient to cover all concentrations that are associated with risks, because their analytical limits are close to their toxicity thresholds. As a result, some concentration ranges that are associated with risks for aquatic organisms cannot be captured, and potential effects on the ecosystem remain undetected. One group of insecticides, pyrethroids, which play an important role in today’s agricultural practice and belong to the most toxic chemicals for aquatic organisms, has conspicuous analytical limits that are almost entirely above the toxicity thresholds. The actual environmental risk of pyrethroids can, therefore, only be assessed to a very limited extent.

According to the authors of the article, their results can presumably be transferred to many other regions of the world. However, the data for the conduction of similar analyses is most often missing. Sascha Bub emphasizes: “Our results illustrate the importance of analyzing the environmental data on large temporal and spatial scales. We need such analyses to be able to guide the monitoring and assessment of the rapidly increasing number of chemicals in use.”",https://smartwatermagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/share-fb-830x436/public/rptu_karin_hiller.jpg?itok=FtMM68_q,N,,2025-07-14 08:17:27.377473

The directive issued by Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh applies to the area inside and along the main ring road that encircles the center of Hanoi. The local government has been tasked with phasing out the two-wheelers by the deadline.

Like the rest of Vietnam, motorcycles are the main mode of transport for most of Hanoi’s 8 million residents. The city has nearly 7 million motorcycles and just over a million cars. But as incomes rise and more people switch to private vehicles, air pollution from traffic has become a growing concern. Hanoi is often enveloped in thick smog, ranking among the most polluted cities worldwide.

Vietnam also wants to switch from fossil-fuel to electric vehicles to cut pollution and tackle climate change. Local EV maker VinFast is leading the shift by holding nearly a fifth of the market share, according to the European Chamber of Commerce. But it still has only a small share of the two-wheeler market.

But many are concerned about the unclear plan for phasing out the vehicles.

Nguyen Van Hung, 62, has spent three decades driving a motorcycle taxi in Hanoi, now working with Grab, a ride-hailing app widely used across Southeast Asia. He worries the ban will hit the working class hardest. “It will affect people who rely on motorbikes to earn a living,” he said, pointing to delivery drivers, commuters and ride-hailing services. “How can people just discard their vehicles?”

Others said that the timeline was unrealistic. Hoang Duy Dung, 32, an office clerk who works in the city center, said he supports cleaner air but believes it is too soon. “We need better public transport and more support before such a big change.”

Central Hanoi is home to much of the city’s business activity, including offices, government buildings and commercial hubs.

A second phase, set to begin in January 2028, will expand the ban to a wider area and include all fossil-fuel two-wheelers, while also restricting some gasoline-powered cars.

Other measures include upgrading waste-treatment plants, using digital tools to monitor pollution and introducing stricter penalties for violators. Whistleblowers could be rewarded for reporting environmental breaches.

Addressing these risks will require China, western actors, and developing countries to work together to align their strategies for a more balanced and resilient transition.

In times of geopolitical and economic volatility, China has become a key driver of the green transition across the global south. Its technology, finance and investment are powering the deployment of low-carbon alternatives from Africa to Southeast Asia and Latin America. As other major powers scale back their climate action, China’s importance is only due to grow.

Yet this role is not without contradictions and gaps

China is the world’s largest current emitter of greenhouse gases, and its cumulative emissions have surpassed those of the European Union. Meanwhile, Chinese corporations continue to pour money into fossil fuels globally, with an expanding presence in natural gas and several Chinese-backed coal power plants coming online despite Beijing’s 2021 pledge to halt overseas coal projects.

To better understand the evolving dynamics of China–global south relations in the climate space, three areas stand out: clean energy and industries, climate finance, and critical minerals.

1. Clean energy: accelerating access, risking dependency

Given weakening domestic demand in China and growing protectionism in the United States and Europe, developing economies have become priority markets for Chinese exports of electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. In 2024, for instance, China’s exports of solar panels to the global south rose by 32%, and have surpassed exports to global north for the first time.

This surge is making clean technologies more accessible but has also sparked tensions. Governments and local industries in many developing countries – including Brazil – worry that an influx of low-cost Chinese products is undercutting their own industrial development and reinforcing long-standing trade patterns where developing economies export commodities and import finished goods.

2. Climate finance: shifting flows, uneven impact

While large Chinese state-to-state loans and grants to the global south have declined since the mid-2010s, China’s climate-related finance continues to play a pivotal role in many developing countries, as highlighted in a recent E3G–ODI report.

The report identified several gaps where further improvement is needed. For example, there is no consistent definition of “climate-related” finance across Chinese governance institutions, and data availability remains patchy. Many Chinese-financed projects are not clearly linked to recipient countries’ national climate strategies, making it challenging to assess their alignment with long-term development and decarbonization goals. In addition, China’s participation in multilateral transparency and debt relief frameworks is still evolving, providing space to further strengthen accountability mechanisms.

3. Critical minerals: control, contestation and sustainability gaps

Chinese firms dominate the processing and global trade of key energy transition minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements, and to a lesser extent, copper. Backed by patient capital and long-term agreements, they have expanded their global footprint, often outpacing Western competitors in speed, scale and risk appetite.

In some cases, Chinese firms have moved beyond resource extraction to invest in local processing and production, offering limited but growing value addition. For instance, they are financing Indonesia’s EV value chain in exchange for access to its vast nickel reserves and have pledged to build lithium processing facilities in Bolivia alongside their extractive projects.

At the same time, environmental and social standards across Chinese-backed projects remain uneven, with community engagement often weak or transactional. Some companies are improving practices but others continue to operate with limited transparency or accountability, fuelling local grievances and raising long-term sustainability risks.

Balancing competition with climate cooperation

Countries in the global south seek to diversify their economic partnerships to gain greater agency within the green supply chains driving the global transition. Advancing a more inclusive and balanced transition will require balancing China’s competitive advantages – particularly on renewables and infrastructure – with strengths usually associated with European and other Western actors, such as capacity building, community engagement and responsible investment practises.",https://www.e3g.org/wp-content/uploads/China-South-South-cover.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:14:11.376092

In short:

A Boston Consulting Group analysis finds a €250 billion shortfall in planned European power grid investments from 2025 to 2029, despite a planned tripling of capital expenditures to €345 billion.

Demand is being driven by electrification, data centers, AI growth, renewables integration, and aging infrastructure, even as recent blackouts in Spain, Portugal, and the Czech Republic raise concerns about grid resilience.

Transmission system operators are facing financial strain, with rising debt loads and limited access to equity markets, and will need to bridge the gap through debt, asset sales, or reduced shareholder payouts.

Key takeaway #1

Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance. Ensuring that substantiation and documentation requirements are met at the outset will allow for better results during an IRS examination. Tax credit buyers and investors should continue to carefully diligence projects to ensure that energy tax credit requirements are met.

Key takeaway #2

While the focus of the July 7th EO and promises made in connection with the passages of the Act appear to focus on the new requirements set forth in the Act, the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit tax years dating back to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 remains open, so taxpayers should ensure that they have audit files at the ready to prepare for possible IRS enforcement activity.

On July 4th, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""Act""), which included a phaseout of incentives for solar and wind generation projects. Projects must either begin construction within one year or be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit or the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit. The House's version of the legislation required a more accelerated phaseout than the Act and only allowed projects that began construction within 60 days of enactment of the bill to be eligible for the tax credits. In discussions last week with House conservatives who favored the faster phaseout of solar and wind tax credits, which was not adopted in the Act, President Trump promised strict enforcement of the rules, including the beginning of construction requirements, for solar and wind projects to qualify for energy tax credits.

On July 7th, President Trump issued an Executive Order (""EO"") titled ""Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources. In the EO, the Trump Administration directs the Treasury Secretary to ""take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities"" within 45 days following the enactment of the Act.

Beginning of Construction Rules

Specifically, the EO directs the Treasury Department to issue new and revised guidance for the beginning of construction requirements, which it states should prevent the ""artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility"" and ""restrict the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

Many House conservatives disfavor the current IRS guidance provisions: the Five Percent Safe Harbor and the Physical Work Test. The Five Percent Safe Harbor allows energy projects to demonstrate ""beginning of construction"" by incurring at least five percent of the total project cost, even if the project isn't completed within the same tax year. The Physical Work Test allows a taxpayer to establish ""beginning of construction"" by beginning physical work of a significant nature.

These ""beginning of construction"" tests are set forth in IRS Notices. Because IRS Notices are informal guidance and not formal guidance, the IRS may withdraw, amend, or issue notices at any time. Taxpayers may rely on the existing IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59, both specifically referenced in the Act, until Treasury and the IRS withdraw and/or issue new guidance.

The ""beginning of construction"" rules are important not only to retain eligibility for the credits past the termination date for the credit, but also to determine whether a project must meet the foreign entity of concern requirements set forth in the Act.

Foreign Entity of Concern Requirements

The EO also directs the Treasury Secretary to take ""prompt action"" to implement the enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions in the Act within 45 days following enactment. The complex FEOC provisions included in the Act limit the ability of ""prohibited foreign entities,"" as defined in the Act, to claim tax credits for qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology that begin construction after December 31, 2025. Taxpayers cannot claim these credits if they engage in sourcing (including, ""material assistance""), licensing, or payments to a prohibited foreign entity. The material assistance restriction renders a taxpayer ineligible for the credit if a certain percentage of the value of a project is sourced from one or more prohibited foreign entities. A taxpayer needs to have a ratio higher than the thresholds set forth in the Act to qualify for the credit.

There are some exceptions, including for certain foreign-controlled publicly traded companies. There are also exceptions for certain manufactured products and eligible components acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and that are placed into service before January 1, 2030 (or for wind and solar facilities before January 1, 2028) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Key Takeaways

Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance. Ensuring that substantiation and documentation requirements are met at the outset will allow for better results during an IRS examination. Tax credit buyers and investors should continue to carefully diligence projects to ensure that energy tax credit requirements are met.

While the focus of the July 7thEO and promises made in connection with the passages of the Act appear to focus on the new requirements set forth in the Act, the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit tax years dating back to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 remains open, so taxpayers should ensure that they have audit files at the ready to prepare for possible IRS enforcement activity.

Kaufman,,,,,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/14/1120027/california-set-to-manage-power-outages-with-ai/,"California's statewide power grid operator is poised to become the first in North America to deploy artificial intelligence to manage outages, MIT Technology Review has learned.
This fits in perfectly with that,” says Gopakumar Gopinathan, a senior advisor on power system technologies at the California Independent System Operator—known as the CAISO and pronounced KAI-so.
Until now, much of the discussion around AI and energy has focused on the electricity demands of AI data centers (check out MIT Technology Review’s Power Hungry series for more on this).
Still, he adds, “it’s a first step for bigger automation.” “Right now, this is more limited to our outage management system.
“But I see a world where AI agents are able to do a lot more.”","California's statewide power grid operator is poised to become the first in North America to deploy artificial intelligence to manage outages, MIT Technology Review has learned.

“We wanted to modernize our grid operations. This fits in perfectly with that,” says Gopakumar Gopinathan, a senior advisor on power system technologies at the California Independent System Operator—known as the CAISO and pronounced KAI-so. “AI is already transforming different industries. But we haven’t seen many examples of it being used in our industry.”

At the DTECH Midwest utility industry summit in Minneapolis on July 15, CAISO is set to announce a deal to run a pilot program using new AI software called Genie, from the energy-services giant OATI. The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators and comes with the potential to autonomously make decisions about key functions on the grid, a switch that might resemble going from uniformed traffic officers to sensor-equipped stoplights.

But while CAISO may deliver electrons to cutting-edge Silicon Valley companies and laboratories, the actual task of managing the state’s electrical system is surprisingly analog.

Today, CAISO engineers scan outage reports for keywords about maintenance that’s planned or in the works, read through the notes, and then load each item into the grid software system to run calculations on how a downed line or transformer might affect power supply.

“Even if it takes you less than a minute to scan one on average, when you amplify that over 200 or 300 outages, it adds up,” says Abhimanyu Thakur, OATI’s vice president of platforms, visualization, and analytics. “Then different departments are doing it for their own respective keywords. Now we consolidate all of that into a single dictionary of keywords and AI can do this scan and generate a report proactively.”

If CAISO finds that Genie produces reliable, more efficient data analyses for managing outages, Gopinathan says, the operator may consider automating more functions on the grid. “After a few rounds of testing, I think we’ll have an idea about what is the right time to call it successful or not,” he says.

Regardless of the outcome, the experiment marks a significant shift. Most grid operators are using the same systems that utilities have used “for decades,” says Richard Doying, who spent more than 20 years as a top executive at the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the grid operator for an area encompassing 15 states from the upper Midwest down to Louisiana.

“These organizations are carved up for people working on very specific, specialized tasks and using their own proprietary tools that they’ve developed over time,” says Doying, now a vice president at the consultancy Grid Strategies. “To the extent that some of these new AI tools are able to draw from data across different areas of an organization and conduct more sophisticated analysis, that’s only helpful for grid operators.”

Last year, a Department of Energy report found that AI had potential to speed up studies on grid capacity and transmission, improve weather forecasting to help predict how much energy wind and solar plants would produce at a given time, and optimize planning for electric-vehicle charging networks. Another report by the energy department’s Loan Programs Office concluded that adding more “advanced” technology such as sensors to various pieces of equipment will generate data that can enable AI to do much more over time.

In April, the PJM Interconnection—the nation’s largest grid system, spanning 13 states along the densely populated mid-Atlantic and Eastern Seaboard—took a big step toward embracing AI by inking a deal with Google to use its Tapestry software to improve regional planning and speed up grid connections for new power generators.

ERCOT, the Texas grid system, is considering adopting technology similar to what CAISO is now set to use, according to a source with knowledge of the plans who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. ERCOT did not respond to a request for comment.

Australia offers an example of what the future may look like. In New South Wales, where grid sensors and smart technology are more widely deployed, AI software rolled out in February is now predicting the production and flow of electricity from rooftop solar units across the state and automatically adjusting how much power from those panels can enter the grid.

Until now, much of the discussion around AI and energy has focused on the electricity demands of AI data centers (check out MIT Technology Review’s Power Hungry series for more on this).

“We’ve been talking a lot about what the grid can do for AI and not nearly as much about what AI can do for the grid,” says Charles Hua, a coauthor of one of last year’s Energy Department reports who now serves executive director of PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for improving the affordability and reliability of US grids. “In general, there’s a huge opportunity for grid operators, regulators, and other stakeholders in the utility regulatory system to use AI effectively and harness it for a more resilient, modernized, and strengthened grid.”

For now, Gopinathan says, he’s remaining cautiously optimistic.

“I don’t want to overhype it,” he says.

Still, he adds, “it’s a first step for bigger automation.”

“Right now, this is more limited to our outage management system. Genie isn’t talking to our other parts yet,” he says. “But I see a world where AI agents are able to do a lot more.”","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP19299598296299-crop.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-07-14 10:15:14.940698

are expected to increase energy demands and as renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, have become cheaper than fossil fuels.","ASHEVILLE - Though only a few employees milled about the West Asheville-based renewable energy provider on July 10, Sugar Hollow Solar is busy these days. All of the company's vans were out on job sites, making solar panel installations on hot rooftops or maintaining systems.

Despite steady business, shifting federal policies have the company of around 65 people bracing for impact. Federal support for residential solar panel installations will wind down later this year.

""It's going to be bad for our economy and just overall in our industry,"" Sugar Hollow Solar's co-founder and CEO Doug Ager said. ""There are going to be some job losses.""

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed into office by President Donald Trump on July 4, will wind down many renewable energy tax credits that incentivized investment into residential renewable energy technologies. Tax credits for residential solar, wind and geothermal installations will end later this year and installations for commercial renewable energy and sustainable homebuilding are set to wind down in 2026 and 2027. The changes give companies like Sugar Hollow Solar mere months to adjust.

For years, Sugar Hollow's residential customers could expect to receive tax credits for installing solar panels. The Residential Clean Energy Credit covers 30% the cost of new residential renewable installations and saved consumers roughly $8,000 to $12,000 per installation, the company's COO Clary Franko said in an interview.

After the bill's passage, the credit, which traces its roots back to the Energy Policy Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2006, will end Dec. 31, giving customers a strict deadline to qualify for lower-cost installations.

""Like everyone in the industry, it's not like we're scheduling for tomorrow,"" Franko said of solar panel installations. ""We're already scheduling a couple few months out. It just doesn't give people a lot of time.""

Investments in innovation, halted

The credits have widely been seen as short-to-mid term investments into the renewable energy sector, which has seen a period of intense growth and innovation in recent years.

From 2012 to 2024, renewable energy production has doubled its share of the country's energy generation growing from 12% to 24%, according to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. The credits also came as increased demand for data centers and A.I. are expected to increase energy demands and as renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, have become cheaper than fossil fuels. But now some are wondering whether that innovation will slow down.

""They were funding innovation and now they are not. I think that's a mistake,"" said Donald Nicholson, who co-owns the family business Nicholson and Sun, which builds net-zero homes across Asheville.

Nicholson's company utilizes the New Energy Efficient Home Credit, which provided $5,000 in credits to contractors that construct and sell homes that are so ""energy efficient that a renewable energy system could offset most or all the home's annual energy use,"" according to the official Zero Energy Ready Home webpage. It was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and set to phase out in 2032, the Big Beautiful Bill will end the program on June 30, 2026.

For more attainable sustainable homebuyers, the ""party's over,"" Nicholson said, as the credit repeal will likely impact pricing. At his company's net-zero community in West Asheville, most available homes fall below the city's current median cost of $507,000. The money makes a difference for homeowners on a tighter budget.

""We try to build entry-level, attainable homes where $5,000 is actually a significant profit,"" Nicholson said. Similarly, Ager expects the residential credit changes to make it harder for lower income residents to invest in renewable technology like solar panel installations.

""Especially in middle income families. It'll make it harder for them to invest in this long-term,"" Ager said

Shifting business, surviving Helene

While utility-level renewable residential credits exist in North Carolina, Sugar Hollow Solar expects to shift it's business from mostly residential installations to a ""50-50"" split with commercial projects, Ager said. Tax credits for commercial projects will expire in 2027, with some credits for battery installations lasting longer.

But, still, at the beginning of 2026, they expect a lull or even contractions in the industry, Ager told the Citizen Times. The business is still optimistic, however. Sugar Hollow Solar's offices had been located along Thompson Street when Tropical Storm Helene hit. The Swannanoa River swamped their offices and led to a roughly $1.4 million loss. A swath of flooded solar panels sit outside their offices, and though they were muddied in the storm, they still work. Ager is considering donating them to a partner in Ukraine.

Two weeks after the storm, the company began making installations again. The company plans to continue through the Big Beautiful Bill's changes.

""We'll be here. We're not going anywhere,"" Ager said.

According to Dominion’s filing this rate would apply to 139 customer accounts including 131 data centers, approximately 30% of data center customer accounts in Dominion’s Virginia service area.
[4] Dominion has also committed to proposing an experimental “High Load Interruptible Load Tariff” in a future proceeding.","The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, hyperscale cloud platforms, and real-time data analytics is fueling a surge in data center development that is driving electricity demand growth not seen in decades, if ever. For electric utilities, this presents an unprecedented opportunity to deploy capital into the infrastructure needed to meet the unique energy demands of data center customers. However, the pace, scale, and uncertainty of demand growth also creates new operational, financial, and regulatory challenges for utilities.

Data center customers have unique service requirements (e.g., large loads, high load factors, preference for low-carbon solutions), a desire to interconnect quickly (relative to traditional commercial and industrial customers), and they tend to be highly sophisticated (i.e., experienced energy/PPA buyers). Meanwhile, utilities have not experienced this level of load growth in decades and accurately forecasting demand has proven difficult in part due to speculative data center proposals and uncertainty around technology enhancements that may reduce the energy needed to power AI and other computing functions. Further, most utilities face resource constraints, be that financial, human, or access to materials. Resources needed to support data center growth may be limited due to other on-going efforts to modernize the grid, improve system reliability and resiliency, and enable the adoption of distributed energy resources and electrification.

Both utilities and regulators are examining the potential operational impacts of data centers, and increasingly, the potential financial implications to other electricity customers. Across the country, utilities are adapting existing tariffs, creating new rate classes, and/or changing energy services agreements to provide clear rules for large load customers while protecting other customers from unfairly bearing the costs of new infrastructure investments that are built primarily to serve these new large load customers.

Traditional ratemaking principles require that utility rates be “just and reasonable,” with costs allocated based on the principle of cost causation (i.e., customers should pay for the costs they impose on the system). To achieve these principles, utilities are considering a variety of tariff or contract provisions for new large load customers including:

Minimum Demand Charges: Requiring customers to pay for a percentage of their contracted capacity, even if actual usage is lower

Minimum Contract Duration: Locking in long-term agreements, which may include ramp-up periods as data centers come online

Exit Fees: Requiring companies to pay hefty fees if they decide to break their contract

Collateral and Credit Requirements: Mitigating financial risks if data center businesses fail

The rate structures and tariff provisions relevant to a given utility will depend on a variety of factors including the market environment and regulatory jurisdiction (i.e., is it a T&D only utility or fully integrated), current system capacity, and the scale of data center demand, among others. Two recent examples in Indiana and Virginia demonstrate how some utilities are adapting their rate structures to serve large load customers.

Indiana Michigan Power a subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP)

In February 2025, Indiana Michigan Power received commission approval to modify its existing industrial tariff to accommodate large loads.[1] The modified tariff applies to customers with new or expanding load with contract capacity greater than (or expected to be greater than) 70 MW at one location or 150 MW in aggregate across multiple locations (each location must exceed 1 MW). The modified tariff also includes provisions which require large load customers to sign an initial contract term of at least 12 years, with an allowable load ramp period of up to 5 years, pay an exit fee if they reduce their contact capacity by more than 20 percent, pay a minimum monthly demand charge of at least 80 percent of their contract capacity, and provide sufficient collateral if they do not meet certain credit rating and liquidity requirements.[2]

Virginia Electric and Power Company a subsidiary Dominion Energy

In March 2025, Virginia Electric and Power Company submitted a request to create a new customer class (GS-5) for existing and new customers with measured or contract demand at one site of 25 MW or greater and a load factor of at least 75 percent.[3] The proposal would require new large load customers to sign a fixed 14-year contract term with the ability to ramp load during the first 4 years. The proposal would also allow customers to reduce their contracted capacity by 20 percent, further reduction in capacity or termination would trigger an exit fee. GS-5 customers also would need to pay a minimum monthly demand charge covering 85 percent of contracted capacity for transmission and distribution, as well as 60 percent of generation. Lastly, large load customers would be required to post a collateral of $1.5M per MW of their contracted capacity if they are unable to meet credit and liquidity requirements. According to Dominion’s filing this rate would apply to 139 customer accounts including 131 data centers, approximately 30% of data center customer accounts in Dominion’s Virginia service area.[4] Dominion has also committed to proposing an experimental “High Load Interruptible Load Tariff” in a future proceeding.

Put in other terms, the richest 1% of Americans would get about 22% of the bill’s tax benefits in 2026.
Much of the bill’s tax policy is an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The New Hampshire state budget signed into law in June increases prescription co-pays and charges some enrollees premiums.
The budget, which was passed before the federal bill, also enacts work requirements.","When Michelle Lawrence heard about the Medicaid cuts included in the Republican tax and spending bill signed into law on July 4, it felt like “a punch to the gut.”

“I laugh, because if I don’t laugh, I cry,” she said.

Lawrence, who lives in Henniker, was diagnosed with a chronic form of cancer called T-cell lymphocytic leukemia 16 years ago. She said she lost her job about five years ago because the cancer was making it too difficult for her to work. And in losing her job, she lost her health insurance because she couldn’t afford COBRA coverage or anything on the marketplace.

“So I applied for Medicaid, which has been a major lifeline for me,” she continued. “That has enabled me and a lot of other cancer patients like me to be able to access the treatment needed in the past few years. I’m here. I’m alive and a contributing member of society. … Without Medicaid, I wouldn’t be able to afford my treatments or go to the doctor.”

Lawrence works 40 hours a month at a nonprofit assisting people with disabilities. Between the symptoms of her cancer and the side effects of her treatment, she can’t work any more than that, she said. But the “big beautiful bill” adds a work requirement to Medicaid that requires people to work 80 hours per month to receive coverage.

“Those 40 hours a month are hard for me to do. I have had cancer for 16 years,” she said. “I can’t create a healthier Michelle that’s going to be able to work 80 hours. If I could, I would have by now, because I’d rather be working. No one wants to be sick and no one wants to be unable to work.”

The bill includes exceptions to the work requirements for “serious and complex medical conditions,” but it’s still unclear if that exemption will apply to all cancer patients, just some cancer patients, or no cancer patients at all. Lawrence said she asked the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, the agency responsible for administering Medicaid in the state, but officials there didn’t have an answer for her.

“And that’s the scary part,” Lawrence said. “It feels like the Wild, Wild West. So we passed this bill, and now it’s left up to interpretation, and I don’t think that’s reasonable, because what am I supposed to do? Like, just carry on and wait to find out if or if not I get kicked off? Should I be planning a funeral instead of my next doctor’s appointment?”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, affects huge swaths of the federal government’s services, budget, and tax code. The bill extends a set of tax cuts enacted in a signature piece of legislation from the first Trump administration, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And it makes deep cuts to social services in order to partially pay for the tax breaks, though independent bipartisan analysis from the Congressional Budget Office still projects the bill will increase the federal deficit. The bill also includes a number of other tax and unrelated provisions. The effective date of those provisions varies, with some changes — such as some of the Medicaid cuts — set to take effect after the 2026 midterm elections.

The cuts will leave states with tough decisions about whether to cover the new funding holes with state money — a big challenge for states like New Hampshire that are in tight budget cycles of their own — or cut the programs.

Asked about her thoughts on the bill and whether the state should pay to fill those gaps, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte provided a statement to the Bulletin: “We are evaluating the impact of the recently passed federal legislation on New Hampshire. I disagree with federal reductions to SNAP and Medicaid benefits and will work closely with DHHS to protect our most vulnerable citizens.”

New Hampshire’s delegation dissents

The bill has been lambasted by Democrats, including the four members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, all Democrats who voted against the bill.

“What this president calls the big beautiful bill, I call the big beautiful betrayal of the American people,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said during a press conference Tuesday. “This bill takes food and health care away from seniors and families to give trillions of dollars more to corporations and to the wealthiest.”

First District Rep. Chris Pappas, who represents the eastern half of the state, called the bill “a disaster for the American people.”

“It’s a cruel bill that contains deep cuts that are going to impact our families, our neighbors, all across the state of New Hampshire,” he said. “This is decidedly unpopular here in New Hampshire … But the fact is, our colleagues across the aisle, it’s not that they didn’t hear it, it’s that they didn’t listen to what people were actually saying.”

Pappas is vacating his seat in the House of Representatives at the end of this term in order to run for Senate in 2026. Scott Brown, one of his Republican opponents in that election, did not respond to the Bulletin’s request for an interview, but he has publicly targeted Pappas for his vote against the bill, writing on social media, “Pappas will side with left-wing partisans in Congress over the people of New Hampshire and the tax certainty in the budget reconciliation package.”

“I proudly support President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill because working families deserve a break,” Brown wrote in a separate post, pointing specifically to provisions that eliminate taxes on tips and overtime.

Tax cuts felt by the rich and the deficit

An analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based fiscal think tank, shows the bill’s tax benefits are heavily skewed to America’s wealthiest. The richest fifth of Americans are set to receive roughly 72% of the net tax benefits in the bill in 2026, while the middle fifth would receive roughly 10%. The poorest fifth would receive less than 1% of the benefits, according to the analysis. Put in other terms, the richest 1% of Americans would get about 22% of the bill’s tax benefits in 2026.

In New Hampshire, the top 1% of households are expected to receive 16% of the bill’s tax benefits, according to the same think tank’s analysis. Those households, which earn more than $894,699 annually, are expected to pay $59,170 less in taxes over the course of 2026, on average. The poorest 20% of New Hampshire households, on the other hand, will receive 1% of the bill’s tax benefits. Those households, which earn less than $37,000, are expected to get $200 in annual savings across 2026.

Many fiscal conservatives embraced the tax cut portion of the bill. Much of the bill’s tax policy is an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a New Hampshire-based conservative think tank, championed those changes and was happy to see them extended.

“To the extent that One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes permanent the 2017 tax rates and does some expansion in terms of business tax deductions … that’s good,” Drew Cline, the organization’s executive director, said. “Those 2017 changes were designed to achieve two main goals: One was to simplify the code, and the other was to stimulate growth. So to the extent that the new bill furthers those goals, those are positive.”

Cline acknowledged that the bill’s tax benefits primarily go to the wealthiest Americans, but he dismissed that as a concern “because the rich are the ones who pay the vast majority of income taxes” already. He argued that the U.S. tax code is currently very progressive, so any tax benefits would be felt by those paying the most taxes already. (Other think tanks disagree on the U.S. tax code’s progressivity; the Brookings Institution, for example, argues the tax code is less progressive relative to peer countries including the U.K., Canada, Spain, Greece, Japan, Germany, and Australia, among others, and is becoming less progressive over time.)

Still, Cline isn’t entirely on board with the bill. He’s not a fan of how tax exemptions for tips and overtime included in the bill will complicate the tax code, which he believes should be simplified. More importantly, Cline is worried about the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit across the coming decade.

“The bigger story here is that we are spending and we are borrowing at crisis levels when we don’t have a crisis,” he said. “And that is not sustainable.”

The biggest cut to Medicaid in U.S. history

The bill cuts Medicaid nearly $1 trillion over the next decade through a number of different provisions. In New Hampshire specifically, the bill is expected to revoke 18% of New Hampshire’s federal baseline spending for Medicaid, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s $3 billion over 10 years. Medicaid, which is funded and operated jointly by state and federal governments, covers roughly 186,000 people in New Hampshire, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

One of the biggest changes to Medicaid is the new work requirements. Opponents of work requirements argue that a vast majority of Medicaid enrollees are already working, that the paperwork and bureaucracy required to prove eligibility is too burdensome for states to do effectively, and that many people — like Lawrence, the cancer patient — are not only too sick to meet the requirement but often not well enough to complete the bureaucratic process of proving they can’t work.

Work requirements have been unsuccessfully attempted at the state level a few times, including in New Hampshire. In 2018, the state enacted a law mandating Medicaid enrollees work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. However, about one month after the rule went into effect in 2019, only about 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement complied and documented their hours. At that point, then-Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, intervened and paused the new system before the remaining roughly 17,000 people lost coverage. The state had spent more than $130,000 in outreach efforts to inform recipients of the requirements and to teach them how to complete the eligibility paperwork. Arkansas and Georgia have also tried to implement work requirements. Arkansas had similar issues until a federal judge intervened and blocked the law.

The cuts also come at the same time as a number of changes to Medicaid at the state level. The New Hampshire state budget signed into law in June increases prescription co-pays and charges some enrollees premiums. The budget, which was passed before the federal bill, also enacts work requirements. However, details on the state work requirements have yet to be ironed out and need to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s also unclear how the state rule would work in relation to the new federal requirements.

U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a former governor who oversaw New Hampshire’s expansion of Medicaid in 2014 before being elected to the Senate, called the bill “the largest cut to Medicaid we have seen in our nation’s history.”

Shaheen, her colleague in the Senate, compared the cuts to Republicans’ failed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.

“We celebrated (in 2017) because we knew that millions of Americans were going to continue to have access to health care,” she said. “Our colleagues in the Senate and the administration are celebrating (now) because millions of Americans are going to lose their access to health care.”

Cuts to SNAP

Laura Milliken, executive director of NH Hunger Solutions, a statewide advocacy group working to address hunger in New Hampshire, said the bill “is just a world of bad.”

The bill includes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps low-income families pay for food. Those cuts are expected to cause 22.3 million families in the U.S. to lose some or all of their SNAP benefits.

“It just is so, so unnecessary and cruel at a time that we’re all feeling like everything’s expensive,” Milliken said. “People are having difficulty affording their housing, their child care, their medication. It seems like the moment to strengthen our programs that protect low-income folks and not to cut them, and this is such a drastic change in the program.”

The bill passes off much of the administrative cost of SNAP to states, which may or may not be willing or able to take on those costs. The bill also reduces benefits for some recipients by restricting what factors can be taken into account when deciding how much a family receives. The bill also caps future increases to SNAP at the rate of inflation. It bans many migrants (specifically refugees and asylees) from participating in the program (people in the country without legal status were already ineligible). And work requirements will become stricter.

“People are scared,” Milliken said. “People are thinking, ‘Boy, I’m barely making ends meet right now, what am I going to do if my SNAP benefits are cut?’”

Milliken said many of the food pantries in New Hampshire are afraid they won’t be able to keep up with the increased demand they expect to see as the provisions of the bill go into effect. She also noted that because SNAP automatically qualifies kids for free and reduced-price school meals, which in turn qualify schools for federal aid, the changes will likely impact other programs as well.

Milliken said NH Hunger Solutions hopes to work with state officials to try to mitigate the effects the bill will have on food insecurity in New Hampshire.

Other provisions

The omnibus bill also has a myriad of unrelated provisions that touch nearly every segment of the federal government.

For example, the bill eliminates the IRS direct file program, which sought to help Americans file their taxes for free. The bill also limits the dollar amount of student loans graduate and professional students can take out. It also eliminates regulations for nursing home staffing requirements, revokes Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, and eliminates several tax credits meant to encourage environmentally friendly practices.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/johnsonbbb-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 07:18:39.952587

""Our partnership with Eaton will deliver innovation that addresses the biggest barriers to electrified transportation,"" ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said. ""Together with Eaton, we will create unprecedented value for institutions that deploy EV charging, accelerating electrification, and decarbonizing the planet in parallel.""

This development is expected to roll out across the United States, Canada, and Europe. It will make EV charging more reliable and maximize the potential and power of EVs.

Using EVs reduces air pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency notes that creating electricity for charging EVs can be done with dirty energy. But EVs themselves don't have tailpipe emissions.

If solar or wind is used to generate electricity, that prevents even more pollution from entering the air.

Charging stations are also becoming more widespread, and batteries are becoming more efficient. A Recurrent study suggests that older models' battery life patterns demonstrate that newer models' batteries will last even longer.

While many people are debunking EV myths, it's important to note that the current EV manufacturing process is still flawed.

The production of EV batteries involves the use of cobalt. EV Magazine has reported on the human rights issues in the cobalt industry in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. EVs are a step toward a greener future, but no one should have to suffer for a cleaner climate.

Companies are working on solutions to create cobalt-free batteries. EV Magazine references Aliant Battery, a company that has been making rechargeable, cobalt-free, lithium batteries since 2022.

You can minimize the resources needed to make this transition happen by buying a used EV. While all models are becoming more affordable over time, buying used can help you save money and minimize waste.

The EPA’s climate change website, for instance, is still up and running, even though all references to the phenomenon were erased on the agency’s home page.
Up until the National Climate Assessments disappeared, she would have said that “climate erasure” was an inappropriate characterization of what’s happening.","For 25 years, a group of the country’s top experts has been fastidiously tracking the ways that climate change threatens every part of the United States. Their findings informed the National Climate Assessments, a series of congressionally mandated reports released every four years that translated the science into accessible warnings for policymakers and the public. But that work came to a halt this spring when the Trump administration abruptly dismissed all 400 experts working on the next edition. Then, on June 30, all of the past reports vanished too, along with the federal website they lived on.

A lot of information about the changing climate has disappeared under President Donald Trump’s second term, but the erasure of the National Climate Assessments is “by far the biggest loss we’ve seen,” said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The National Climate Assessments were one of the most approachable resources that broke down how climate change will affect the places people care about, she said. The reports were also used by a wide swath of stakeholders — policymakers, farmers, businesses — to guide their decisions about the future. While the reports have been archived elsewhere, they’re no longer as easy to access. And it’s unclear what, if anything, will happen to the report that was planned for 2027 or 2028, which already existed in draft form.

So why did the reports survive Trump’s first term, but not his second? You could view their disappearance in a few different ways, experts said — as a flex of executive power, an escalation in the culture war over climate change, or a strategic attempt to erase the scientific foundation for climate policy. “If you suppress information and data, then you don’t have the evidence you need to be able to create regulations, strengthen regulations, and even to combat the repeal of regulations,” Gehrke said.

This isn’t climate denial in the traditional sense. The days of loudly debating the science have mostly given way to something quieter and more insidious: a campaign to withhold the raw information itself. “I don’t know if we’re living in climate denial anymore,” said Leah Aronowsky, a science historian at Columbia Climate School. “We have this new front of denial by erasure.”

By cutting funding for research and withholding crucial data, the Trump administration is making it harder to know exactly how the planet is changing. In April, the administration pulled nearly $4 million in funding from a Princeton program to improve computer models predicting changes in the oceans and atmosphere, claiming the work created “climate anxiety” among young people. That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency failed to submit its annual report to the United Nations detailing the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ended its 45-year tradition of tracking billion-dollar weather disasters. Trump also hopes to shut down the Mauna Loa laboratory in Hawaiʻi, which has measured the steady rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide since the 1950s — the first data to definitively show humans were changing the climate.

“This kind of wholesale suppression of an entire field of federally sponsored research, to my knowledge, is historically unprecedented,” Aronowsky said.

In a response to a request for comment, the EPA directed Grist to a webpage containing past greenhouse gas emissions reports, as well as a version of what was supposed to be this year’s report obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund. However, the agency confirmed that the latest data has not been officially released. The White House declined to comment, and neither NASA nor NOAA responded in time for publication.

Last year, a leaked training video from Project 2025 — the policy roadmap organized by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank — showed a former Trump official declaring that political appointees would have to “eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere.” The strategy appears to be designed to boost the fossil fuel industry at a time when clean energy has become competitive and the reality of climate change harder to dismiss, as floods, fires, and heat waves have become perceptibly worse. “We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said in his inauguration speech in January.

The administration hasn’t exactly been subtle about its endgame. Lee Zeldin, the head of the EPA, doesn’t deny the reality of climate change (he calls himself a “climate realist”), but he’s zealously dismantled environmental programs and has recommended that the White House strike down the “endangerment finding,” the bedrock of U.S. climate policy. It comes from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Air Act that required the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants since they endanger public health. If the administration can convince the courts that climate change isn’t a health consideration, it could end that regulatory obligation.

“If you’re removing information about climate change, its reality, and its impact on people, then I think it’s a lot easier to make the case that it’s not an environmental health issue,” Gehrke said.

There’s a word for the idea that ignorance can serve political ends: agnotology (from the Greek “agnosis,” or “not knowing”), the study of how knowledge is deliberately obscured. What Trump is doing to information about climate change fits squarely in that tradition, according to Aronowsky: “If you remove it, then in a certain sense, it no longer exists, and therefore, there’s nothing to even debate, right?”

Climate denial first took off in the 1990s, when the oil and gas companies and industry-friendly think tanks started sowing doubt about climate science. Over the decades, as the evidence became rock-solid, those who opposed reducing the use of fossil fuels gradually shifted from outright denying the facts to attacking solutions like wind and solar power. What the Trump administration is doing now marks a radical break from this long-term trend, said John Cook, a climate misinformation researcher at The University of Melbourne in Australia. “This is a 180, not just a turn, but diving into something we’ve never even seen before,” he said. On the other hand, Cook said, the administration is taking a classic climate denial tactic — painting scientists as “alarmists” or conspirators who can’t be trusted — and turning it into government policy.

Half a year in, the second Trump administration’s treatment of climate information hasn’t yet reached the “eradication” levels that Project 2025 aspired to, at least on government websites. The EPA’s climate change website, for instance, is still up and running, even though all references to the phenomenon were erased on the agency’s home page. Most of the website deletions so far have served to isolate climate change as an issue, erasing its relationship to topics such as health and infrastructure, Gehrke said. Up until the National Climate Assessments disappeared, she would have said that “climate erasure” was an inappropriate characterization of what’s happening. “But now, I’m really not so sure,” she said.

Rachel Cleetus, the senior policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, thinks that the administration’s actions actually go beyond erasure. “They’re literally trying to change the basis on which a lot of policymaking is advanced — the science basis, the legal basis, and the economic basis,” she said. Her biggest concern isn’t just what facts have been removed, but what political propaganda might replace them. “That’s more dangerous, because it really leaves people in this twilight zone, where what’s real, and what’s important, and what is going to affect their daily lives is just being obfuscated.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/natl-climate-assessment-social.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-07-14 07:19:48.926260

“Together, we’re making it easier and safer for fleet owners to handle EV battery disposal responsibly and meet their ESG requirements, while unlocking second-life value and reducing environmental impact” said Rod Savage, Head of Operations at recell.store.

As sales of EVs continues to grow, so too will the need for responsible management of end-of-life batteries. According to McKinsey, over 100 million batteries are expected to be retired in the next decade.

“Finding a safe and ethical way to dispose of batteries addresses a current and growing issue in our sector” added Alan Bastey, Decarbonisation and Sustainability Consultant at Zenith. “This partnership ensures we have the foundations in place to enable us to manage the asset responsibly on behalf of our customer, while setting standards within the industry.”

Recell.Store will partner with OEMs, salvage yards and fleet owners to ensure efficient and safe reuse, repurposing and recycling of batteries. By recovering the critical materials such as lithium and nickel from battery waste, Altilium is creating a sustainable domestic supply chain for the battery metals essential for the UK’s transition to a clean transport future.

Altilium’s proprietary EcoCathode recycling process can recover over 95 percent of the cathode metals from EV battery waste, in a format that can be directly reused in battery manufacturing, with up to 74 percent lower GHG emissions compared to mined materials and 20 percent lower costs.

SNAP cuts will also hit the state, said Ife Finch Floyd, the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute's director of economic justice.
The federal cuts extend that to age 64 and will require parents of kids ages 14-17 to hold a job.
Nearly $4.5 trillion in tax cuts nationwide are projected to add a net $3.24 trillion to the red ink.
Without the bill, those 2017 tax cuts would have expired, leading to a major tax increase, Wingfield said.","The new federal budget bill passed by Congress includes significant cuts to healthcare, food assistance, and clean energy programs, while also extending tax cuts.

Critics argue the cuts will disproportionately harm low- and middle-income Georgians, particularly in rural areas, and increase the state's financial burden.

Supporters contend the tax cuts benefit all income levels and that work requirements for Medicaid recipients could incentivize employment.

The bill's impact on Georgia includes potential hospital closures, increased health insurance premiums, reduced food assistance, and setbacks for the renewable energy sector.

ATLANTA - When Congress passed President Donald Trump's controversial budget bill July 3, Republicans and Democrats went to their corners to portray it either as the largest tax cut in U.S. history or a devastating gutting of the nation's safety net.

But beyond the politics, Georgia health-care and clean-energy advocates warned that cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and food stamps, as well as the phasing out of clean-energy tax credits will hurt low- and middle-income Georgians in exchange for easing the tax burden on the wealthy who don't need such government largesse.

""It's the largest cut ever, and it moves us in the wrong direction,"" said Monte Veazey, president and CEO of the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals. ""It's a moral failure that hurts everyone who depends on our health-care system.""

The bill's cuts to health care will kick about 93,000 Georgians off of Medicaid and raise health-insurance premiums for more than 1.2 million Georgians, according to numbers released by U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. More than 120,000 Georgia children will lose some or all food assistance, according to Warnock.

Veazey said rural Georgia will be hit particularly hard, with 16 cash-strapped rural hospitals facing potential closure and others being forced to reduce services they offer that lose money.

""For every Medicaid patient we serve, we lose about 17 cents on the dollar,"" he said. ""This is going to grow that number. It's going to be difficult for people to access the health-care system.""

Advocates for low-income Georgians and children said the federal cuts will shift the cost of paying for health insurance and food to states.

Georgia will have a couple of choices, they said: dig into its own treasury to fill the void or cut services.

State cutbacks to the ACA, Medicaid and SNAP (the food stamps program) could be achieved by introducing more administrative requirements, they said, something the federal government is already imposing.

Identity ""proofing"" challenges with ACA ""mean that many folks just won't enroll because of administrative burdens,"" said Whitney Griggs, director of health policy for Georgians for a Healthy Future.

Work requirements and direct cuts will cost Georgia $10 billion in Medicaid funding over the next decade, said Leah Chan, director of health justice for the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute.

SNAP cuts will also hit the state, said Ife Finch Floyd, the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute's director of economic justice.

The federal government historically has covered the full cost of SNAP, but the new budget bill changed that by requiring states to pay a percentage of their cost if they have an unacceptable payment ""error rate,"" meaning inaccurate eligibility roles, Chan said.

""This is unprecedented, and this is a fundamental change in the structure of the SNAP program,"" she said.

In a few years, states with an error rate of 6% or more will have to pay 5% to 15% of their program benefit costs, Chan said, noting that in Georgia, 5% is equal to $162 million.

It also will become harder for Georgians to qualify for SNAP with the new federal work requirements. Currently, people ages 18-54 without children or a qualifying disability must prove they are working 80 hours a month to receive benefits. The federal cuts extend that to age 64 and will require parents of kids ages 14-17 to hold a job.

The phasing out of clean-energy tax credits will do tremendous damage to fast-growing renewable energy and electric vehicle operations across Georgia, said Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga. The massive EV plant Hyundai opened in March west of Savannah in Bryan County is the largest economic development project in the state's history.

""The renewable sector, solar manufacturing, battery production, electric vehicle manufacturing will all be hurt,"" Ossoff said. ""This bill is a direct attack on the industry that is driving Georgia's economic development, job creation, and wealth creation.""

The same goes for the state's solar energy industry, added Hannah Shultz, program director at the nonprofit Georgia Interfaith Power and Light.

""Solar tax incentives have allowed over a dozen faith communities in the last several years to build resilience, reduce their electric costs, and reinvest savings into vital mission and ministry initiatives in service to their communities,"" she said. ""It is incredibly disheartening to see partisan politics take precedence over real impacts to people and our planet.""

While most of the reaction to the budget bill has come from critics decrying the various spending cuts, one group that stands to benefit from the legislation is farmers.

Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tyler Harper said prices of farm inputs have increased by 30% in the last half dozen years. Nationally, the bill invests an additional $60 billion in farm programs.

""It helps agriculture across the board,"" Harper said. ""Investment in farm programs ... is a success for all farms regardless of size.""

Even taxpayer advocates are criticizing the bill because of its impact on the nation's growing debt. Nearly $4.5 trillion in tax cuts nationwide are projected to add a net $3.24 trillion to the red ink.

""Congress has officially lost its mind when it comes to fiscal responsibility,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a really ugly, scary, ticking debt bomb.""

But Kyle Wingfield, president and CEO of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, said the bill's tax cuts simply make permanent the lower tax rates Congress enacted early in Trump's first term in the White House. Without the bill, those 2017 tax cuts would have expired, leading to a major tax increase, Wingfield said.

Wingfield disputed claims by opponents that the measure only benefits the wealthy.

""It's all the brackets all the way up and down,"" he said. ""The bulk of the tax money that gets cut goes to the middle class because there are so many middle-class taxpayers.""

The work requirement in the bill for Medicaid recipients has been widely criticized since many face significant barriers to employment including health problems and child-care duties.

But Wingfield said the legislation could give able-bodied recipients the incentive they need to find a job.

""Far from being a punitive or harmful policy, this could end up helping people be in a better position,"" he said.","https://www.augustachronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/10/PTAL/84541276007-trump-and-bill-signing.jpg?crop=1878,1056,x0,y0&width=1878&height=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-14 05:08:32.110518

BID Energy’s 4,000MWh BESS in New South Wales

BID Energy, an independent advisory and development firm specialising in renewable energy projects, is leading the largest of the two initiatives.

The company is also pursuing another BESS project in Australia: the 400MW/800MWh Derringullen Energy Storage System near Yass, New South Wales.

The new utility-scale 4,000MWh Kiar BESS will be located in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, just under 100km north of Sydney. The project will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via a 330kV transmission line running through the site, owned by network operator Transgrid.

By leveraging this existing infrastructure, BID Energy aims to minimise the costs of connecting the project to the NEM.

The Kiar BESS will include rows of enclosed battery modules connected to power conversion systems (PCS) and underground 33kV high-voltage ring main reticulation equipment and switchgear.

The layout and quantity of battery modules, PCS, and ring main units will be finalised during the detailed design and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process.

The project will cover approximately 110 hectares and will be decommissioned at the end of its proposed 25-year operational life. Construction is expected to take 18 to 24 months, with commissioning anticipated for late 2027 or early 2028.

BID Energy has committed to working with the Central Coast Council, local residents, Indigenous groups, businesses, and other stakeholders to ensure the project benefits the community through benefit-sharing arrangements.

X-Elio’s 1,200MWh BESS in the Southern Tablelands

Spanish sustainable energy developer X-Elio, owned by Canadian asset manager Brookfield, is proposing the 300MW/1,200MWh Canyonleigh BESS in the Southern Tablelands region of New South Wales.

The project is located near Brayton, around 200km southwest of Sydney and 120km northeast of Canberra.

The Canyonleigh BESS will be situated to the east of X-Elio’s proposed Willavale Park Renewable Energy project, which features 300MW/600MWh of BESS co-located with a 72MWp solar PV power plant. Like BID Energy’s Kiar BESS, the Canyonleigh system will connect to the NEM.

The project will cover approximately 48 hectares, with the BESS itself requiring around 13 hectares.

According to the EPBC Act application, the Canyonleigh BESS will consist of lithium-ion battery units housed in shipping container-style enclosures, along with inverters, transformers, and other related electrical infrastructure.

Construction, including grid connection and commissioning, is expected to take 12 to 18 months. The BESS will have an operational lifespan of between 20 and 30 years.

X-Elio’s expanding BESS Portfolio in Australia

X-Elio is actively developing energy storage projects across Australia, many of which integrate BESS with renewable energy generation, such as utility-scale solar PV.

Earlier this year, the company submitted plans for a 720MW solar-plus-storage project in Queensland to the EPBC Act. This project features a 4-hour duration 720MW/2,880MWh BESS.

In 2022, X-Elio’s 200MW Blue Grass Solar Farm near Chinchilla, Queensland, began operations. The project is set to add a cumulative 148MW grid-forming BESS in two stages.

With state-of-the-art automation, certified quality systems, and a strong foundation in precision manufacturing, we are driving India’s clean energy ambitions forward—one panel at a time.

Aniruddh Agrawal Founder of Ahaan Solar, tells us more. Excerpts from an interview:

DQ: What inspired you to venture into solar module manufacturing? How does this complement your parent company Airox Nigen's hydrogen expertise?

Aniruddh Agrawal: The inspiration came from a strategic vision to build an integrated clean energy ecosystem. Airox Nigen has been at the forefront of hydrogen generation technology for over three decades. As green hydrogen production relies heavily on clean electricity, solar became a natural extension.

Ahaan Solar was founded to complement Airox’s green hydrogen mission by providing efficient, high-quality solar modules entirely manufactured in India. Together, we are building a vertically integrated renewable value chain that spans from solar power generation to hydrogen production, storage, and application. It’s about bringing synergy between two technologies that are crucial to India’s decarbonization and energy independence goals.

DQ: The Rohnat Renewable Energy Park houses your 2 GW solar module manufacturing project. Can you walk us through the scale, milestones, and impact of this initiative?

Aniruddh Agrawal: Our 17-acre facility in Rohnat, Haryana, is more than a factory, it's a clean energy blueprint. In Phase 1, we’re launching a 600 MW line by mid-2025, with advanced automation and precision engineering capabilities. The full-scale 2 GW capacity will be completed in phases over the next few years.

This project directly aligns with India’s National Solar Mission and the Make in India initiative by reducing reliance on imported solar components. We expect to generate hundreds of jobs, stimulate regional manufacturing, and supply high-efficiency modules for both domestic projects and exports. It's our way of contributing tangibly to India's renewable energy roadmap.

DQ: Ahaan Solar is deploying advanced TOPCon technology in its modules. How do this innovation enhance the efficiency and sustainability of your solar products?

Aniruddh Agrawal: We have chosen TOPCon because they represent the cutting edge of solar efficiency and long-term performance. TOPCon cells offer higher conversion efficiencies and lower degradation, making them ideal for India's high-irradiance conditions. It also combines the best of crystalline and thin-film technologies, ensuring better performance in low-light and high-temperature environments.

Both technologies extend module lifespans and reduce the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) over time. These innovations make our modules more sustainable, not just in terms of energy output, but also in resource use, recyclability, and reliability across varied geographies.

DQ: How does Ahaan Solar integrate cutting-edge technology and sustainable practices throughout your manufacturing process?

Aniruddh Agrawal: Sustainability is embedded in our DNA, because of our history with Airox Nigen. Our facility is designed to optimize water and energy consumption using closed-loop systems and rooftop solar integration. Automation and AI-driven quality control ensure minimal material wastage and consistent output.

We are sourcing raw materials with transparency and focusing on reducing our overall carbon footprint during production. Our R&D team is also working on low-lead soldering and glass recycling initiatives to further green our supply chain. This approach doesn’t just help the planet; it ensures customers receive durable, high-performance modules built with responsibility and care.

DQ: With operations slated to commence by the end of-2025, what are your production targets for both domestic and international markets? How do you plan to scale beyond the initial 600 MW capacity?

Aniruddh Agrawal: Our initial 600 MW line is expected to be operational by the end of 2025, primarily serving domestic demand for utility-scale and rooftop solar projects. Post-commissioning, we aim to ramp up to 1.2 GW within the next 18 months and achieve full 2 GW capacity within the next few years.

The consequences of this shift carry significant implications for climate finance, emissions trajectories, and global climate action efforts at a critical moment.
The Big Beautiful Bill now phases out or dramatically reduces these critical tax incentives and subsidies starting around 2026-2027.
Without federal incentives, renewable energy projects previously viable could struggle for financing, and clean energy jobs are likely to be severely impacted.
Historically, the U.S. has been central to international climate initiatives, financial assistance, and investment mobilization in renewable energy and climate resilience.","We have been told we have very little time to act if we want to avoid a climate disaster. Yet, on July 4 President Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law. This legislation fundamentally reorients U.S. energy policy, shifting federal support from renewable energy initiatives toward fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The consequences of this shift carry significant implications for climate finance, emissions trajectories, and global climate action efforts at a critical moment.

Significant investments under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law placed the United States on a path toward reduced carbon emissions through increased reliance on renewable energy, including wind, solar, and electric vehicles. These incentives directly drove investment growth, expanding renewable energy projects nationwide, fostering technological innovation, and significantly boosting green-sector employment.

The Big Beautiful Bill now phases out or dramatically reduces these critical tax incentives and subsidies starting around 2026-2027. Without federal incentives, renewable energy projects previously viable could struggle for financing, and clean energy jobs are likely to be severely impacted. Independent analyses forecast potential job losses in the clean energy sector totaling approximately 830,000 nationwide due to scaled-back investment.

Perhaps the starkest consequence, however, is the anticipated rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Previous climate policy goals sought significant reductions in U.S. emissions aligned with international targets such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement. However, climate researchers estimate that under the Big Beautiful Bill, emissions could rise substantially — by approximately 500 to 730 million metric tons annually by 2035 compared to current projections under existing policies.

Globally, the financial commitment needed to combat climate change has been extensively documented. The 2022 McKinsey report, “The Net-Zero Transition,” estimated that reaching net-zero emissions globally by 2050 requires an annual capital expenditure of approximately $9.2 trillion — $3.5 trillion per year above current investment levels. Similarly, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its 2021 “Net Zero by 2050” report recommended doubling global clean energy investments to around $4 trillion annually by 2030 to meet a 1.5°C warming limit.

Yet global emissions continue to rise. According to the UNEP 2023 Emissions Gap Report, even full implementation of national climate pledges currently leaves the world on track for a dangerous warming scenario between 2.5 and 2.9°C, significantly above the safer 1.5°C threshold. This report underscores that inaction carries severe economic consequences, estimating global losses of $2 trillion to $4 trillion per year by 2100 from unchecked climate disruptions.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (2023) emphasized the urgent need for global emissions to peak by 2025 and halve by 2030 to maintain any realistic hope of staying within the 1.5°C limit. Achieving these goals, according to IPCC analysis, requires global investments in climate mitigation to increase three to six times current spending levels.

With each year that passes without adequate investment, the window to maintain safe levels of warming shrinks dramatically.

The Big Beautiful Bill’s shift away from renewable energy and toward fossil fuels and nuclear power introduces significant economic costs domestically. Experts forecast increased household energy expenses, potentially by $100 to $400 annually per family by 2035, coupled with higher wholesale energy prices. This increase reflects not only a loss of renewable energy cost benefits but also increased reliance on more expensive energy sources over time.

Moreover, the social costs of delayed climate action are not evenly distributed. Marginalized and economically vulnerable communities, already disproportionately impacted by climate-induced disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and heatwaves, face exacerbated financial burdens as energy costs rise and resilience efforts stall. Financial resources to protect and empower these communities through the energy transition are further jeopardized.

Historically, the U.S. has been central to international climate initiatives, financial assistance, and investment mobilization in renewable energy and climate resilience. This new legislative direction reduces America’s leverage in international climate negotiations, potentially weakening the overall global response as other major emitters may reconsider their climate commitments.

As renewable investment momentum shifts toward countries like China and Germany, the U.S. could find itself significantly behind in key economic sectors essential for future global competitiveness, from electric vehicles to battery storage technologies.

The passage of the Big Beautiful Bill highlights the broader challenge facing climate finance globally: political will remains the most critical — and elusive — resource. While technically and economically feasible, meeting global emissions targets requires coordinated, sustained, and significant financial investments. As of 2025, the opportunity to meet the 1.5°C target is widely considered nearly lost. Yet, the slightly higher target of 2°C warming remains achievable, albeit increasingly difficult with every passing year of inaction.

The next several years could decisively shape global climate outcomes for generations. The window for impactful climate action remains narrowly open, but time and financial resources are critically constrained.

The question is no longer about knowing the cost, but whether there remains sufficient political and financial commitment — both within the U.S. and internationally — to make timely, transformative investments. The clock continues to tick.

Investment Takeaway: - Buy: For investors seeking exposure to LNG infrastructure and a company with visible earnings catalysts.","The geopolitical calculus of energy security has never been more intertwined with corporate strategy than it is today for Kinder Morgan (KMI). As the U.S. and European Union (EU) deepen their LNG partnership to counterbalance Russian influence, Kinder Morgan's $8.8 billion project backlog—nearly 65% larger than three years ago—has emerged as a critical lever for sustained earnings growth and a geopolitical bulwark. The company's Southern U.S. infrastructure buildout, anchored by pipelines like the Trident and Gulf Coast Express, is not just a play on rising LNG demand; it's a strategic response to Europe's energy transition, and investors would be wise to take note.

The Backlog Boom and LNG's Role in KMI's Future

Kinder Morgan's project pipeline ($8.8B net as of Q1 2025) is now 91% weighted toward natural gas infrastructure, with LNG exports and Gulf Coast power generation as its twin pillars. Flagship projects like the $1.6B Trident Intrastate Pipeline—set to deliver 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to Texas LNG terminals by early 2027—and the $1.8B South System Expansion 4 (SSE4) highlight the company's focus on linking shale gas abundance to export hubs. These projects are underpinned by long-term contracts, which management claims will generate a first-full-year Project EBITDA multiple of 5.9x upon completion.

The math is compelling: KMI's 2025 budgeted Adjusted EPS of $1.27—a 10% jump from $1.16 in 2024—is directly tied to these capital expenditures. Meanwhile, its recent acquisition of Outrigger Energy II's Bakken infrastructure ($640M) further strengthens its feedgas supply chain, ensuring reliable LNG feedstock for Gulf Coast terminals.

Why the EU Needs Kinder Morgan's Southern U.S. Hub

The EU's energy strategy has shifted decisively toward U.S. LNG. In 2024, the U.S. supplied 46% of EU LNG imports, and post-January 2025—when Russian gas transit through Ukraine ended—European LNG demand surged. By Q1 2025, U.S. LNG's share of EU imports had grown to 53%, displacing Russia's 14% slice. This dynamic is a windfall for Kinder Morgan, as its Gulf Coast infrastructure is the gateway for 70% of U.S. LNG exports.

The EU's REPowerEU plan aims to cut Russian gas dependency further, but renewables alone can't fill the gap. Natural gas remains a bridge fuel, and Kinder's pipelines are the arteries. For instance, the Trident Pipeline will directly connect Katy, Texas shale fields to the Port Arthur LNG terminal, reducing transportation bottlenecks and ensuring European buyers have a reliable, non-Russian supplier.

Risks and Mitigation: Tariffs, Demand, and Geopolitical Volatility

No infrastructure play is without risk. Kinder Morgan faces headwinds like steel tariffs, which could inflate project costs. However, the company has mitigated this by securing domestic steel contracts for two-thirds of its backlog and negotiating cost caps.

On the demand side, the EU's gas consumption has fallen to an 11-year low, but LNG's role is structural. Even with renewables growth, IEEFA forecasts EU LNG demand will remain above 150 billion cubic meters annually through 2030—a level Kinder's backlog is designed to meet.

The Investment Case: EPS Growth and Dividend Discipline

KMI's dividend has grown for 14 consecutive years, and the Q1 2025 hike to $0.2925/share (2% annualized) underscores management's confidence. With a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.1x (projected to drop to 3.8x by year-end), the balance sheet is sturdy enough to support both capital spending and shareholder returns.

Critically, Kinder's backlog is a multi-year earnings catalyst. Each $1B of projects placed into service typically boosts annual EBITDA by ~$170M—meaning the $8.8B backlog could add over $1.5B to EBITDA once fully operational. This trajectory aligns with the company's 2025 guidance: $8.3B in Adjusted EBITDA (+4%) and $2.8B net income (+8%).

Conclusion: A Play on LNG and Geopolitical Certainty

Kinder Morgan's strategic pivot to LNG infrastructure positions it as an indispensable player in the U.S.-EU energy alliance. With its backlog growth and contract-heavy model, KMI is well-placed to convert geopolitical tailwinds into steady EPS growth. For investors seeking a leveraged play on energy security and a dividend stalwart, Kinder Morgan merits a closer look.

Investment Takeaway:

- Buy: For investors seeking exposure to LNG infrastructure and a company with visible earnings catalysts.

- Hold: If you already own KMI, the backlog execution and dividend growth justify patience.

- Avoid: Only if you believe LNG demand will collapse, which seems unlikely given EU's long-term decarbonization plans still rely on natural gas as a transition fuel.

The next few years will be a proving ground for Kinder's strategy, but the stakes—and the LNG exports—are too high for the company to fail.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-14 04:06:25.195617

Supporters are celebrating the win for Frasier Solar but worry about how much the power siting board focused on whether local government opposition was unanimous.
Only within the past few years have state regulators used unanimous local government opposition as a reason to kill proposed solar projects.","A contested solar agrivoltaics project avoided having its permit denied by Ohio regulators, likely thanks to the neutral stances of a county board and one of its townships.

The Ohio Power Siting Board approved construction of the 120-megawatt Frasier Solar project late last month despite local groups’ organizing efforts, which led the other township within the project’s 840-acre footprint and a neighboring township to pass anti-solar resolutions. The power siting board has found that unanimous local government opposition was reason enough to decide other solar projects did not meet a public interest requirement under state law. One of those cases is before the Ohio Supreme Court.

In the Frasier case, however, local governing bodies for Knox County and Clinton Township stayed neutral. Knox County voted unanimously in 2023 to accept a payment arrangement instead of property taxes, which will add more than $40 million for local governments over the project’s 40-year useful life, but it took a neutral position on the project itself.

About six months after an evidentiary hearing — basically an administrative trial — on Frasier Solar, Knox County restricted new solar projects within most of its boundaries. However, legal counsel for the Ohio Ethics Commission found that a conflict of interest prevented Drenda Keesee, a newly elected Knox County commissioner, from taking official action against Frasier Solar because she owned property next to the project site. Another county commissioner served as an ad hoc power siting board member for the Frasier decision, so he could not take a position before hearing the case. He wound up voting with the board’s majority to grant the permit.

Prior to the administrative trial, Clinton Township’s board had clarified that despite an anti-solar position for future projects, it was officially neutral on Frasier Solar.

“We had a very small dog in the fight,” Clinton Township Trustee Jay Maners told Canary Media, noting that most of the project will be in Miller Township. He recalled that there was sparse attendance at early trustee meetings when the project was discussed, with most in favor of it. Then ​“everything exploded” with people suddenly voicing opposition, he said.

“There was a lot of misinformation,” Maners said, such as solar opponents falsely claiming tax dollars would pay for the project, and solar proponents warning about rising energy prices.

The Ohio Power Siting Board’s June 26 ruling discussed Clinton Township’s neutral stance on Frasier Solar, as well as that of Knox County, to stress that local government opposition was not unanimous. The board found that the project was in the public interest and approved the permit.

Supporters are celebrating the win for Frasier Solar but worry about how much the power siting board focused on whether local government opposition was unanimous. That leaves solar energy vulnerable to a standard that depends on potentially arbitrary local government rulings, rather than regulatory experts’ judgment of projects’ merits.

Frasier Solar is exempt from parts of Senate Bill 52, a 2021 law that lets counties block large solar and wind projects before they get to the power siting board. Yet its developer, Open Road Renewables, faced substantial local opposition and misinformation, much of which was stoked by a dark money group with multiple connections to fossil fuel interests and the anti-solar speakers it brought in. Opponents also went to local township meetings to push for anti-solar resolutions.

The staunch local opposition and involvement of fossil fuel interests fit a pattern playing out across the country. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University last month reported a 32% jump in the number of contested projects for 2024 compared with 2023.

Only within the past few years have state regulators used unanimous local government opposition as a reason to kill proposed solar projects. Those projects, like Frasier, were otherwise exempt from parts of the 2021 law. But Ohio regulations don’t contain such a rule. Another part of Ohio law appears to say that local government consent isn’t a condition for siting decisions.

“I’m certainly happy to see this project move forward, and it had every reason to move forward,” said Dan Sawmiller, Ohio energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Yet he questioned what the role of the power siting board is if it lets unanimous local opposition control whether projects go ahead.

“They’ve got the goal post cemented in, and it’s in the wrong location,” Sawmiller said. As he sees it, the board and its staff have a responsibility to use their expertise to make decisions in the public interest for the whole state.

It’s also hard to fact-check local government resolutions, said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a Cleveland State University law professor who testified as an expert witness for the Ohio Environmental Council. Those decisions could be based on misinformation or simply be a response to political pressure, with little focus on the factual basis for objections.

Facts vs. misinformation

Frasier Solar became ​“known nationally as part of a case study on how the fossil fuel industry stokes opposition to renewable energy projects,” said Dave Anderson, policy and communications director for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group on utility and fossil fuel influence.

Testimony at the administrative trial revealed that an anti-solar group called Knox Smart Development had big financial backing by Tom Rastin, who has been a leader of the Empowerment Alliance, an anonymously funded group that promotes the natural gas industry. Rastin is a former vice president of Ariel Corp., which makes equipment for the oil and gas industry.

Anti-solar media flourished throughout the area during the permitting process too. An eight-page Ohio Energy Reporter sent by bulk mail consisted mostly of anti-solar advertorials. Anti-solar stories and ads also ran in outlets such as the Mount Vernon News, which ProPublica described as a conservative ​“pink slime” publication.

Evidence introduced by the developer last summer characterized some of the opposition’s publicity as ​“misinformation campaigns,” which the power siting board noted in its opinion.

Nonetheless, the project had an ​“encouraging level of support, both locally and from across the state,” said Craig Adair, vice president for development at Open Road Renewables. About 40% of those who spoke at local public hearings or filed comments favored the project.

More significantly, the siting board considered the merits of comments, not just the total numbers. In doing so, the board focused on Robertson’s testimony, which found that half of opponents’ unique arguments at local hearings were factually inaccurate or unsupported by evidence. About a third were already addressed by permit conditions, and nearly one-tenth were just subjective opinions, she also found.

“The happy news is that the siting board and the staff weren’t snowed by the number of opposing comments,” Robertson told Canary Media. ​“We really were able to take the wind out of their sails on the vast majority of the negative comments.” A similar analysis may help in future cases, she suggested. ​“We can’t let truth and facts disappear. We have to keep pushing what is real.”

The board’s ruling also noted evidence provided by chapters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about jobs and other positive economic benefits. Additional experts for the Ohio Environmental Council described how the solar farm and revenue from it could help local governments deal with climate change impacts.

“Given the risks Ohio faces from climate change, the board’s review of any application is incomplete without considering impacts,” said Karin Nordstrom, one of the Ohio Environmental Council’s lawyers in the case.

Adair welcomed the other parties’ supporting evidence and said he hopes to see the same level of scrutiny in future cases. ​“As long as the board continues to review projects on their merits and not fall prey to the misinformation, it’s encouraging,” he said.

Still, solar and wind projects continue to face hurdles under state law that don’t apply to fossil fuels. While counties now have the power to block most large solar and wind projects, local governments can’t even enforce zoning restrictions against oil and gas development.

“A lot of businesses are going to say, ​‘I’ll take my investment elsewhere,’” Adair said. And while some projects like Frasier may get approval, the combination of SB 52 and other deference to local governments ​“is going to leave you vulnerable to getting the supply that you need on the grid,” he added.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Knox-County-fields.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=2e97c8c5d9f79b44ddc18aa871167853,N,,2025-07-14 05:08:36.308090

There’s this irony: we are modifying the weather – it’s called climate change.","Good morning. The death toll from the catastrophic floods in Texas has climbed to 129, including at least 27 children and counsellors at Camp Mystic in Kerr County.

With more than 160 people still missing, authorities warn that the number of casualties is likely to rise. On Sunday morning, some search operations were cancelled as heavy rain and strong winds battered the state once again.

The flash floods, which swept through large parts of central Texas, are being described as one of the worst natural disasters in the state’s history. At Camp Mystic, rain gauges recorded 6.5in (16.5cm) of rainfall in just 180 minutes.

In addition to the human cost, the floods have caused widespread destruction. According to a preliminary estimate by private forecaster AccuWeather, the economic toll could range from $18bn to $22bn (£13.2bn to £16.2bn).

The floods struck as the climate crisis worsens, and as the Trump administration’s hollowing out of federal agencies has left critical services such as the National Weather Service under severe strain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is also facing continued threats of defunding.

Yet, despite the scale of devastation, there has been little public reckoning over climate breakdown or the erosion of essential public services. Instead, conspiracy theories have abounded.

To understand how this catastrophe unfolded and the political response to it, I spoke to Oliver Milman, the Guardian US environment reporter. That’s after the headlines.

Five big stories

Israel-Gaza | An Israeli airstrike has killed at least 10 people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water in Gaza, Palestinian health officials have said. Dozens of others were killed in Gaza over the weekend in a separate strike near a food aid distribution site.

In depth: What we know so far

The devastating floods began in the early hours of 4 July, Independence Day in the US. Oliver Milman told me that what started out as a seemingly small storm stalled in an area where two rivers in central Texas meet, and dumped an enormous amount of rain.

“It caused the river to burst its banks, swept away homes, cars, flooded rivers and, most tragically, caught up on Camp Mystic,” Oliver said. “There’s still hope that some people could be rescued, but it’s certainly going to be one of the biggest, deadliest natural disasters in recent US history.”

Oliver said there are several factors that could explain why this flood was so devastating. We also get into the responses from elected officials and other players.

How much of this is down to the climate crisis?

As the planet gets hotter, mostly because of humans burning fossil fuels, the atmosphere is able to hold more moisture. One meteorologist told Oliver that the Earth’s atmosphere is now like a giant sponge.

“You’ve got more moisture in the atmosphere, and more energy because it’s getting hotter, and therefore you’re getting more of these extreme precipitation events happening in several places around the world, including parts of the eastern US. But the western half of the US seems to be getting more drought,” Oliver said. “So, very crudely speaking, half the country’s not getting enough rain, and the other half is getting too much in these intense downpours.”

He pointed to some interesting statistics from the Environment Protection Agency: of the 10 heaviest precipitation single-day events in US history going back to 1910, nine have happened since 1995. “We’re clearly getting more and more of these events. There’s been research done showing they’re becoming more common in Texas and will continue to as the world heats up,” Oliver added.

The geography of central Texas also made the floods more catastrophic. “It’s hilly and has these canyons, lots of rivers, and not much topsoil. So when rain hits, it flies off the ground very quickly. It’s known as “Flash Flood Alley” in some places, so that was a factor. The rain hit, and the devastation followed.”

What impact have Donald Trump’s cuts had?

The other factor, which Oliver likened to a toxic cocktail, is the political situation in the US.

“The Trump administration has essentially tried to gut the federal workforce: firing scientists, firing weather forecasters, trying to eliminate large sections of the scientific agencies that deal with climate change. So you had a situation where a lot of National Weather Service offices, which track storms and issue warnings, were critically understaffed,” Oliver explained.

Democrats have called for an investigation into whether the sweeping cuts introduced by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), once led by Elon Musk, played any role in the disaster. The Trump administration has dismissed any suggestion that its policies had an impact.

“The Trump administration has pushed back quite hard and said this was an act of God, there were adequate resources, and so on,” Oliver said. Yet, understaffing was an issue and there was a disconnect between the meteorologists issuing warnings and the emergency services, he said.

“The National Weather Service issued a warning about dangerous flood conditions at 1.14am [on 4 July], but there wasn’t – and it’s still unclear why – coordination with emergency services to evacuate people, to mobilise resources in enough time. A lot of people are pointing fingers at the cuts Trump has made to the coordination services usually handled by the federal government.”

And it’s not just Trump that people are focusing on. The week before the floods, Texas senator Ted Cruz, ensured that the “big, beautiful bill”, a Republican spending bill pushed through and signed by Trump on Independence Day, would include particular cuts.

“It does a lot of things: cuts the social safety net, people lose health care, gives tax breaks to the wealthy, removes food assistance, guts support for clean energy,” Oliver said. “But one thing it also did was remove a $150m fund to improve weather forecasting at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Cruz personally inserted the language to cut that and then, tragically, just days later this storm hit his home state and killed many people. So there are a lot of questions being asked about his role and whether those cuts played a significant role.”

Republicans have largely fallen into line on the Texas floods, lavishing praise on Trump, while avoiding questions around the effect of Doge.

Has this moved the dial on the climate emergency?

In Texas, the reaction on the ground has been one of disbelief and devastation, Oliver said. “There’s a lot of ‘thoughts and prayers’ rhetoric in Texas right now, a sense of rallying to help those in need. People are mainly stunned rather than immediately pointing fingers, although local officials are raising questions about how much warning they got from the National Weather Service. There are also concerns about the local government’s actions. There had been a plan to install an early-warning flood system along the river, but the idea was ditched because it was considered too expensive. So you’ve got this local angle, too.”

Far-right players have descended on central Texas in a stunt they claim is part of a “disaster relief” effort. In a video posted by one group, they say their so-called “activists” are distributing supplies to survivors, but make clear that they are prioritising “their people” and “European peoples” in those operations.

As is now common when disaster strikes, conspiracy theories are being spread, Oliver said, by rightwing influencers and elected representatives such as Marjorie Taylor Greene. “They have questioned the cause [of the flood], whether it’s weather modification, cloud seeding, some nefarious machine. There’s this irony: we are modifying the weather – it’s called climate change. But it’s not the kind of weather modification they’re talking about.”

Oliver isn’t surprised by this reaction. “People are now able to live in their own realities, sealed off from facts,” he said. “Whatever people believed before the storm, the storm just reinforced it. That’s become a recurring theme, not just in disasters but in politics more broadly. People are very entrenched here. I know that’s also an issue in the UK and Europe, but in the US things feel paralysed. I don’t know if this will move anyone’s opinion.”

The Upside

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad

Social media can be brutal, but Brenda Allen is doing her bit to make it more benign. The 95-year-old, who lives in Cheshire, has proved a huge hit on TikTok. Her videos, in which she talks through her collection of Jellycat soft toys, have garnered more than 2m views, along with a flood of requests in the comments from people asking to adopt her as their gran.

Brenda is now planning to auction her collection of Jellycats in aid of a children’s hospice. Her daughter Julie said that the family had been “blown away” by her moment of internet fame.

During the 6-week training program, students rotate through 10 work-stations to gain hands-on skills in framing, electrical wiring, drywall installation, weatherization, insulation, painting and light fixture installation.
Oliveto said: “We build our program on a construction-based foundation with the green energy components weaved in, because green energy isn’t standalone.
In our program, students not only become part of a team, but they also develop real skills that make them feel confident and capable.”","A new workforce training program targeting young adults 18 years and older, was created to help ensure that all New Yorkers, including those in Disadvantaged Communities (DACs), are included in NYS’s clean energy future. The program is led by Liz Oliveto, WPWDB Youth Program Director in partnership with Training Provider Soulful Synergy to prepare 18 participants to enter the growing field of clean construction with confidence, competence, and purpose.

Funded by a New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) Office of Just Energy Transition (OJET) Renewable Energy Training Initiative (RETI) Grant, the program recognizes that climate change does not impact all communities equally. RETI funding provides:

The up-skilling or re-skilling of workers transitioning from fossil fuel to clean energy positions;

The up-skilling or re-skilling of residential workers in weatherization, building performance, and retrofitting, including fees for required industry-recognized credentials; and

Wraparound services during training, including but not limited to, childcare, transportation, housing, food, mental health services, and substance use treatment or services.

The Westchester, NY program, which launched in May and wraps up on July 11th, combines foundational construction certifications with specialized green building credentials and real-world hands-on experience. The initiative is designed not only for individuals new to the field but also for those seeking to reskill or upskill, providing a rare, flexible approach to clean energy workforce development.

Oliveto said: “Too often, workforce programs are linear and limited. This one is different. We’re giving participants not just a starting point, but a foundation and options for where they can go next, whether that’s further specialization in green building or jumping directly into a job. That kind of flexibility is rare.”

Foundations in Safety and Sustainability

Participants earn a comprehensive suite of 10 certifications, including OSHA 30, Fall Prevention, Drug & Alcohol Awareness, EPA Section 608, and the Building Performance Institute’s Principles of Building Science. The first three represent the Site Safety Training Card which is essential for anyone entering the construction field. It started as a New York City requirement but has since become standard in Westchester County and, as many employers work in both locations, it gives participants the flexibility to work in either. They also complete two certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council’s GPRO program, covering the fundamentals of green building and sustainable construction management.

During the 6-week training program, students rotate through 10 work-stations to gain hands-on skills in framing, electrical wiring, drywall installation, weatherization, insulation, painting and light fixture installation. These build-out exercises are designed to simulate real job site conditions.

Oliveto said: “We build our program on a construction-based foundation with the green energy components weaved in, because green energy isn’t standalone. It depends on traditional construction knowledge. You can’t install solar panels on a building without a proper roof. You need to understand how the building is put together before you can enhance its sustainability.”

Student participant Michael Novello said: “I’ve already experienced a lot of personal growth and am getting more confident in what I’m doing. I have a bit of background in a lot of what we’re learning, but it’s learning the right way to do it, understanding why we build the way we build. Also I love the teamwork. We work with different people every day and we learn to work together. It’s been a real positive experience.“

A Human-Centered Approach

What truly sets this program apart is its commitment to student support. With an exceptionally low student-to-instructor ratio, sometimes as low as 4:1, the program meets learners where they are. All participants face at least one significant barrier to employment, from financial hardship to lack of transportation. This training isn’t a typical classroom, and it’s not a typical staff either.

CEO and Director of Training, Soulful Synergy Alejandro Alvaraz said: “Thanks to the support from the grant and from Liz Oliveto, our instructors actually have the time and flexibility to support the students as individuals. Whether it’s emotional support, a practical resource like bus fare, or just someone to ask. ‘Have you eaten today?’—there’s someone available to do that. We have been very intentional about choosing empathetic, student-centered instructors which is why we retain students. If their basic needs aren’t met, they can’t focus on learning.”

The staff includes alumni of past training programs who now give back as instructors, creating a full-circle community of support and mentorship.

From Training to Career Placement

Job readiness is a key component of the curriculum. Participants receive career coaching in resume writing, interviewing, and how to present themselves in business settings. The ultimate goal: to place every graduate in a meaningful, good-paying clean energy job.

Alvarez said: “We want our students to walk into interviews with pride. They’ll be able to say, ‘I know these tools. I built this wall. I understand sustainable construction.’ That confidence makes all the difference.”

To date, several students have expressed interest in pursuing further training in areas like electrical work, while others are preparing to step directly into green energy jobs. Soulful Synergy is actively working to place graduates with employers across New York City and Westchester.

Alvaraz concluded: “People need a sense of purpose. People need to be part of a group with a shared purpose. People need to feel competent within that group—they need to feel they’re contributing something of value. That third piece is what’s often missing in traditional education. In our program, students not only become part of a team, but they also develop real skills that make them feel confident and capable.”",https://riverjournalonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Students-Michael-Novello-and-Daniel-Cruz-349x480.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 05:08:40.491325

The first one is a crumb rubber processing plant operated by PT Potensi Bumi Sakti, located in Glee Siblah Village, Woyla District, West Aceh. The second is Indonesia's first eco-friendly solder manufacturing facility, run by PT Solder Tin Andalan Indonesia (STANIA), situated in the Tunas Industrial Estate in Batam, Riau Islands.

Hashim, CEO of Arsari Group, noted that the Aceh rubber plant was a long-awaited project that began construction back in 2013 but only became operational in 2025 − nearly 12 years later.

“This might be the slowest-built factory in Indonesia,” Hashim said to laughter from the audience, as quoted by Antara, on Tuesday, July 8, 2025.

He attributed the delay to difficulties accessing bank credit during his time in political opposition, which made securing financing nearly impossible − even from local institutions like Bank Aceh. However, he expressed renewed optimism for future financing to support Indonesia’s economic growth.

The Aceh facility currently employs 200 workers, with the potential to scale up to two shifts, creating jobs for 400 to 600 people. The installed machinery can process 10 tons of wet rubber per hour or 5 tons of dry rubber daily. Once fully operational, it’s expected to process 100 tons of dry rubber per day, or roughly 30,000 tons annually, with operating costs reaching Rp4 billion (US$246,314) per day.

Meanwhile, the Batam-based solder plant under STANIA is built on a 6,500 square meter site and is capable of producing 2,000 tons of solder bars annually. Future expansion targets a capacity of 16,000 tons per year, including solder wire, powder, and paste products, with revenue projections of up to Rp1 trillion (US$61.6 million).

Currently, one production line employs 80 people, and expansion to four lines is planned as demand grows. “This is just one line for both leaded and lead-free solder. If demand increases, we’ll expand to four lines,” Hashim said.

The Batam factory emphasizes sustainability by using 100 percent renewable energy, certified by PLN’s Renewable Energy Certificate (REC), making it a zero-emission facility. The building is also designed to reduce electricity use through optimal natural lighting.

“Through eco-friendly technologies and strategic collaborations, we aim to show that the mining industry can also lead in sustainability,” Aryo Djojohadikusumo, President Director of Arsari Tambang, said.

On the supply chain side, STANIA has signed a Head of Agreement (HoA) with PT Freeport Indonesia to source lead and silver − two key components in high-quality solder production. Additionally, STANIA has partnered with Volex, a global connectivity solutions provider, to export solder product internationally.",https://cdn.indonesiabusinesspost.com/3/5/4/3/hashim-djojohadikusumo-image-source-katadata_300x206.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 05:08:46.012334

About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.
Indian air conditioners are inefficient Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.
“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.
Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — India’s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them.

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.

The Line 5 tunnel project has been under scrutiny from lawmakers, environmentalists and tribes in the Great Lakes region for more than a decade.
If the project is approved without proper analyses of climate change, other companies may have more leeway to cite the project and executive order as reasons for why NEPA considerations aren’t necessary, she said.
“Michigan already knows it doesn’t want to suffer those climate impacts, and we’re moving in the other direction,” Keele said.
——— This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, https://insideclimatenews.org, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.","Groups submitting comments on the latest stage of the Enbridge Line 5 oil pipeline project in Michigan argue the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has failed to complete adequate analyses of climate change impacts and greenhouse gas emissions.

On May 30, the Corps’ Detroit district released its draft environmental impact statement for the Enbridge Energy Line 5 Tunnel Project, in which Canada-based energy company Enbridge would construct a 3.6-mile tunnel under the lakebed of the Straits of Mackinac that would house a replacement segment of Line 5, through which Enbridge transports 540,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.

Right now, 72-year-old dual pipelines run along the bottom of the straits en route from northwestern Wisconsin through Michigan into Sarnia, Ontario. It crosses both Dickinson and Iron counties in the region.

However, experts from the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network, which submitted joint comments on the project June 30, argue the draft EIS is inadequate, failing to take climate change into consideration and overlooking potential harms of the project.

“The biggest thing is that the Corps decided to entirely exclude any considerations of greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts that are associated with the tunnel project, and their reasoning for doing this was that it’s consistent with the executive order that President Trump issued earlier this year,” said Ellis Walton, an associate attorney at ELPC.

ELPC argued that the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, requires a deeper review than the Corps completed.

“NEPA the statute, as well as NEPA precedent … has established that federal agencies should be looking at foreseeable effects of major federal actions, and it’s pretty foreseeable that a tunnel project that extends the lifeline of (an oil) pipeline would have foreseeable climate impacts and foreseeably contribute to greenhouse gases and climate change,” Walton said. “It’s so important for the Corps to analyze these climate impacts and understand how we may be harming environmental quality now as well as in the future.”

Changes to NEPA rules were issued in late June by agencies including the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, Interior, Defense and Transportation “to simplify this overly burdensome process and ensure efficient and timely environmental reviews,” the White House said in a statement at the time.

That comes on the heels of a May 29 U.S. Supreme Court decision that gives the federal government more power to decide what to focus on in a NEPA review — and what to leave out. “Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote.

Keele and Walton said their groups are still reviewing the changes, but both expressed confidence that earlier precedents on NEPA will provide stable grounds for arguing against the project.

Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company supports and welcomes the public comment process now underway. “Public and stakeholder input is essential to the integrity of this process, and we look forward to hearing feedback, answering questions, and continuing to engage transparently with all interested parties,” Duffy said in a statement.

White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said the project is part of the Trump administration’s promise to unleash American energy to promote the economy and security while protecting natural resources.

“Line 5 is great for families in Michigan and Wisconsin, who benefit from quality jobs within the energy industry and lower costs from expanded pipelines,” Kelly said in a statement.

In comments to Inside Climate News, the Corps reiterated it removed the topics of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change from the draft EIS in accordance with the executive orders.

The Corps has said since 2023 that it would not evaluate climate impacts from the extraction and use of the pipeline’s products in its EIS of the Line 5 project. Although it initially said it would evaluate emissions from tunnel construction and operation, no such evaluation appears in the current draft EIS.

In that draft, the agency says greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and environmental justice are “Not Applicable” for the draft EIS because of Trump’s Jan. 20 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order and his move to rescind executive orders signed by Democratic presidents.

In the Corps’ executive summary of the draft EIS, the terms “climate change” and “greenhouse gas emissions” do not appear at all — although the term “emissions” is included, in each case related to local air quality.

Denise Keele, executive director of MiCAN, said her group argues the energy crisis cited in Trump’s executive order is not a true emergency. “The last time we checked, our fossil fuel industry was making record profits, and I don’t think there’s an emergency in getting fossil fuels out of the ground,” Keele said, adding that the “real emergency” is the potential impacts of climate change on human health and the environment that could result if the project is constructed.

The Corps also cited Trump’s order in April when announcing a truncated timeline for public comment on the project and its draft EIS, giving groups less time to review the statement and submit comments.

The normal comment period is 60 days, and for a project this big it is usually extended up to 90, Keele said. In this case, the period was 30 days.

The Line 5 tunnel project has been under scrutiny from lawmakers, environmentalists and tribes in the Great Lakes region for more than a decade. In 2020, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered the state Department of Natural Resources to revoke the permit allowing Enbridge to operate its dual pipelines in the straits. Enbridge challenged that decision with a lawsuit filed the same year. Attorneys for the state are still seeking to dismiss the challenge.

Another ongoing case, filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in 2019 against Enbridge, argues the 1953 permit for Line 5 was never valid. On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would take up the case to determine whether it belongs in state or federal court. Duffy said Enbridge is looking forward to the high court’s review.

Keele said another concern is the precedent that the project could set should it move forward. If the project is approved without proper analyses of climate change, other companies may have more leeway to cite the project and executive order as reasons for why NEPA considerations aren’t necessary, she said.

Meanwhile, Keele said, Michigan has been prioritizing a renewable energy economy–it set a goal to generate 60% of state electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Moving forward with Line 5, she said, would go against the state’s efforts to phase out fossil fuels.

“Michigan already knows it doesn’t want to suffer those climate impacts, and we’re moving in the other direction,” Keele said.

According to the Renewable Energy Statistics 2025 by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Asia continues to lead the shift, accounting for 71% of new renewables capacity in 2024.
Last year, the world added 582 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity.
If the same pace continues, the world will only reach 10.3 TW, missing the target by 0.9 TW.
“Achieving the target by 2030 would require renewable capacity to expand even faster at 16.6% annually in less than the remaining five years,” IRENA said.","Asia continued to lead in clean power capacity.

Despite global renewable energy capacity growing by 15% in 2024, some regions still get left behind, widening the transition gap across the world.

According to the Renewable Energy Statistics 2025 by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Asia continues to lead the shift, accounting for 71% of new renewables capacity in 2024. It is followed by Europe and North America, contributing 12.3% and 7.8%, respectively.

This leaves behind Africa, Eurasia, Central America and the Caribbean, which together accounted for 2.8% of total capacity addition. Despite its massive economic and development opportunities, Africa only increased its renewables capacity by 7.2%, IRENA said.

“Bridging the divide and closing the investment gap between countries and regions is critical. It requires targeted policies, international financing, and partnerships that unlock capital and technology where they are needed most,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera.

“By aligning investment flows with policy frameworks, we can ensure that the green transition becomes a powerful engine for resilience and sustainable economic growth worldwide,” he added.

Last year, the world added 582 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity. This is dominated by solar and wind power, which account for 97.5% of all net additions in 2024, with the former increasing by 453 GW, and the latter adding 114 GW.

Whilst it represents a record increase, it still falls short of the pace required to reach the global tripling target of 11.2 terawatts (TW) by 2030, RENA noted. If the same pace continues, the world will only reach 10.3 TW, missing the target by 0.9 TW.

“Achieving the target by 2030 would require renewable capacity to expand even faster at 16.6% annually in less than the remaining five years,” IRENA said.",https://asian-power.com/s3/files/styles/opengraph/public/2025-07/pexels-pixabay-46169_1.jpg?h=88d8e81c&itok=jShmmgVD,N,,2025-07-14 06:11:31.437845

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community.","by Brian G. Henning, Gonzaga University, [This article first appeared in The Conversation, republished with permission]

In June 2021, a deadly heat wave pushed temperatures to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in Spokane, Washington, a northern city near the Idaho border where many homes weren’t built with central air conditioning.

As the heat lingered for over a week, 19 people died in Spokane County and about 300 visited hospitals with signs of heat-related illnesses.

Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region. To help save lives, the city teamed up with my university, Gonzaga, to start preparing for a hotter future.

We were excited and relieved when the community was awarded a US$19.9 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help it take concrete steps to adapt to climate change and boost the local economy in the process. The grant would help establish resilience hubs with microgrids and help residents without air conditioning install energy-efficient cooling systems. The city doesn’t have the means to make these improvements on its own, even if they would save lives and money in the long run.

Less than a year later, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the funding.

Spokane’s grant wasn’t the only one eliminated – about 350 similar grants that had been awarded to help communities across the country manage climate changes, from extreme heat and wildfire smoke to rising seas and flooding, were also terminated on the grounds that they don’t meet the White House’s priorities. Many other grants to help communities have also been terminated.

Many of the communities that lost funding are like Spokane: They can’t afford to do this kind of work on their own.

Why cities like Spokane need the help

Like many communities in the American West, Spokane was founded in the late 19th century on wealth from railroads and resource extraction, especially gold, silver and timber.

Today, it is a city of 230,000 in a metro area of a half-million people, the largest on the I-90 corridor between Minneapolis and Seattle. In many ways, Spokane could be on the cusp of a renaissance.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a $48 million grant to develop a tech hub that could put the Inland Northwest on a path to become a global leader in advanced aerospace materials. But then, in May, the Trump administration rescinded that grant as well.

The lost grants left the economy – and Spokane’s ability to adapt fast enough to keep up with climate changes – uncertain.

This is not a wealthy area. The median household income is nearly $30,000 less than the state average. More than 13 out of every 100 people in Spokane live in poverty, above the national average, and over 67% of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunch.

The city is a light blue island in a dark red sea, politically speaking, with a moderate mayor. Its congressional district has voted Republican by wide margins since 1995, the year that then-House Speaker Tom Foley lost his reelection bid.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome

The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community. The newly formed Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water and the Environment brought together a coalition of government and community partners to apply for the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program. The grants, funded by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, were intended to help communities most affected by pollution and climate change build adaptive capacity and boost the safety of their residents.

A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well. People just weren’t showing up. Our research found that the best approach is to strengthen existing community facilities that people already turn to in moments of difficulty.

Half the $19.9 million award was for outfitting five resilience hubs in existing libraries and community centers with solar arrays and battery backup microgrids, allowing them to continue providing a safe, cool space during a heat wave if the power shuts down.

Another $8 million in grant funding was meant to provide 300 low- to moderate-income homeowners with new high-efficiency electric heat pump heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, providing more affordable utility bills while improving their ability to cool their homes and reducing fossil fuel emissions.

Communities are left with few options

Now, this and other work is at risk in Spokane and cities and towns like it around the country that also lost funding.

According to the Trump administration, the program – designed to help hundreds of communities around the country become safer – was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

A class action lawsuit was recently filed over the termination of the grants by a coalition that includes Earth Justice and the Southern Environmental Law Center. If the case is successful, Spokane could see its funding restored.

Meanwhile, the city and my team know we have to move fast, with whatever money and other resources we can find, to help Spokane prepare for worsening heat. We formed the Spokane Community Resilience Collaborative – a partnership between community organizations, health officials and the city – as one way to advance planning for and responding to climate hazards such as extreme heat and wildfire smoke.

As concentrations of heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, both the frequency and severity of heat waves increase. It is only a matter of time before another deadly heat dome arrives.

The announcement was made in Riyadh on Sunday in the presence of the Minister of Energy, His Royal Highness, Prince AbdulAziz bin Salman bin AbdulAziz Al Saud, with power purchase agreements signed with the Saudi Power Procurement Company as the off-taker for all projects.

The development forms a crucial component of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 diversification strategy, with the Public Investment Fund (PIF) committed to delivering 70% of the nation's renewable energy targets by 2030.

The seven facilities include the 3,000 MW Bisha solar plant in Asir province, the 3,000 MW Humaij solar installation in Madinah, and 2,000 MW projects at Khulis in Makkah province and two sites in Riyadh province at Afif1 and Afif2. Wind energy capacity will be provided by the 2,000 MW Starah facility and 1,000 MW Shaqra plant, both located in Riyadh province.

Construction is expected to begin following financial closure in the third quarter of 2025, with projects becoming operational between the second half of 2027 and first half of 2028.

ACWA Power's CEO Marco Arcelli described the agreement as ""a significant milestone in Saudi Arabia's strategic vision for a more resilient and sustainable energy landscape"", whilst Badeel's Acting CEO Sultan AlNabulsi emphasised that, ""this investment will enhance the resilience of the energy sector nationally, positively impacting all other vital sectors of the national economy, and increasing the country’s investment attractiveness.""

Aramco's Senior Vice President of New Energies, Waleed Al Saif, said the company was ""delighted to expand our footprint in the renewables business"" and highlighted how the partnership would help ""build Saudi Arabia's renewable energy infrastructure""

The company officially inaugurated the first phase of the project in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia. The facility has an annual production capacity of 320,000 tonnes of green ammonia.

Zhang Lei, Envision’s founder and CEO, stated “This is more than a technological milestone. Scalable, green alternatives are now real and operational. We can’t get to net zero without green hydrogen, and we can’t afford to wait. This is the blueprint for a clean energy future.”

Plans for Expansion and Global Export

Envision announced that exports of green ammonia from the Chifeng plant will begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Looking ahead, the company plans to scale up production to 1.5 million tons per year by 2028, making it a cornerstone of China’s ambition to lead in green fuel technologies. s move aligns with Beijing’s strategic energy priorities. Hydrogen—along with its carriers ammonia and methanol—is now at the heart of China’s clean energy agenda, following its dominance in electric vehicles, solar panels, and battery manufacturing.

How Green Hydrogen is Produced

Unlike conventional hydrogen that relies on fossil fuels, green hydrogen is produced via electrolysis. This process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar. This method ensures zero carbon emissions, making it a key solution for decarbonising sectors like steel, cement, fertilisers, and shipping. According to China’s National Energy Administration, the country produced around 36.5 million tonnes of hydrogen in 2024, making it the world’s top producer. However, more than half of this volume still comes from fossil-fuel-based methods.

Stronger Policy Support for Green Fuels

At the beginning of 2025, Beijing ramped up policy support for green hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia. The move acknowledges their critical role in reducing emissions from traditionally hard-to-abate industries. The government’s push comes amid rising global demand for green fuels driven by the urgent need for energy transition to combat climate change.

Global Demand Set to Surge

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global hydrogen demand will rise by 1.5 times current levels by 2030, reaching about 150 million tons annually. New applications in the EU, East Asia, and the US are expected to drive a significant portion of this growth.

Strategic International Partnership

In May 2025, Envision Energy signed a long-term agreement with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation to supply green ammonia from the Chifeng facility. Industry leaders expect this deal to accelerate the adoption of clean fuels. Key sectors set to benefit include chemicals, fertilisers, and maritime shipping.

Driving Toward Cost Competitiveness

As reported by scmp.com, Envision aims to achieve price parity between its green ammonia and methanol and their fossil-fuel-based counterparts by 2028. This goal reflects the company’s broader vision to make green fuels economically viable and globally competitive.

With this project, Envision Energy is expanding China’s clean energy footprint.

Eni said in a media release that this initiative is part of Plenitude’s broader strategy, which identifies Energy Communities - specifically CER (Renewable Energy Communities), AUC (Collective Self-Consumption), and AID (Individual Remote Self-Consumption) - as an innovative and sustainable energy model.

These configurations offer businesses, citizens, and communities, within a local area, a platform to produce, consume, and share renewable energy, Eni said.

The AID project involves building a 758-kilowatt-peak photovoltaic plant, expected to generate approximately 860 megawatt-hours annually. Eni added that the energy produced will be virtually shared among five Nuova Simplast supply points.

The plant will be set up on an unused industrial lot owned by Nuova Simplast, next to its headquarters, and will distribute the renewable energy to nearby facilities. As a result of this project, Nuova Simplast will qualify for 20-year state incentives for Energy Communities. Part of these incentives will, as required by law, be used to support local social initiatives around the plant, Eni said.

Plenitude will support Nuova Simplast from design to the application for state incentives, providing its partner the Plenitude Comunità Energetiche digital platform to enable the management and monitoring of the AID configuration.

AID allows solar energy systems to be installed on surfaces other than traditional rooftops, overcoming potential structural limitations, Eni highlighted. This flexibility enables businesses to make use of unused industrial land or adjacent plots, optimizing space and energy production.

On a larger scale, locally produced and consumed renewable energy within the Energy Community alleviates pressure on the national power grid. By reducing peak demand, it contributes to increased grid stability and helps stabilize energy prices, Eni added.

About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.
Indian air conditioners are inefficient Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.
“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.
Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — India’s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them.

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.

This story was originally published by Vox.com and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In 2023, my husband and I bought our house in southwest Colorado, in part because it backed up to open space. That was the dream: trails just past the fence, a scrubby network of oak and sage stretching out into the hills beyond. But a little over a year into homeownership, I was questioning the wisdom of living so close to a burnable landscape.

This past winter’s spate of wildfires across Los Angeles made that fear of living alongside such a combustible landscape all the more real—fear that was only intensified by the weather. In my town, winter and its all important snow never really showed up. By spring, our snowpack was well below normal, winds were whipping, and I was becoming more paranoid about my wildfire risk.

It’s not just people like me—living on the edge of fire-prone terrain—who may be sharing that paranoia.

More than 100 million people across 20 states and Washington, DC, live in the path of the increasingly fierce hurricanes. Most of the eastern half of the country is now at risk for tornadoes, and floods have increased in frequency and intensity in both coastal areas and river valleys. Over the Fourth of July weekend, extreme flooding in central Texas was among the most deadly of the past century.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information found that 2024 held the second-most billion-dollar natural disasters ever for the US—right behind 2023. This year, with its already higher than average fire activity and predicted busy Atlantic hurricane season, is already shaping up to be significant, too.

At the same time, government cuts have undermined every critical juncture for disaster preparation. Federal programs for wildfire mitigation, proactive work like thinning forests and conducting prescribed burns, which help prevent large scale fires, have been halted due to staffing cutbacks and lack of funds.

Cutbacks to the National Weather Service, through reductions in force at NOAA, have already led to gaps in forecasting, which makes it harder for the public to plan for extreme weather events like the Texas Hill Country floods this month or the deadly May tornadoes, which killed at least 27 people as they swept across Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia.

And the agency explicitly tasked with disaster relief is shrinking. FEMA has cut funding for its bipartisanly popular Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, a major tool for building flood-resistant infrastructure, among other resiliency projects. It has lost some of its ability to help us recover, too. FEMA, already understaffed in 2024, has lost a third of its workforce since the beginning of the year. It has scaled back training and stands to lose $646 million in funding. As if that’s not enough, President Donald Trump has said he plans to phase out FEMA as a whole after the 2025 hurricane season

In the face of all that, I wanted to find out what all of us could do to limit our risk.

The first step was pretty basic: Instead of just spiraling about hypotheticals, figure out the specific risks in your area. For now, FEMA’s National Risk Index, where you can identify the threats to your community, remains a good source. By looking through the index, I learned my county is high in wildfire risks—which I already knew—but also that the area is prone to landslides, drought, and severe lightning storms.

Once I knew the risks, I looked at how I could prepare.

But the answers weren’t obvious. I reached out to both my regional FEMA office, whose contact was easy to find online, and the national headquarters, because I wanted to know what sort of concrete things I could do to protect my home—and what kind of support I might expect if the worst-case scenario happened to hit my community. I got a short email back saying that I should contact local authorities.

And so I started the real journey there, by looking at my local resources.

The most meaningful thing you can do on your own is harden your own home against relevant disasters. I found online that my local fire department provides free wildfire assessments because they think reducing your own vulnerability is one that can also reduce community risk. “The less time I have to spend at your house,” Scott Nielsen, my local wildfire battalion chief, told me, the more he can spend fighting other parts of the fire.

Nielsen says that when it comes to mitigating fire, we can’t change things like topography or weather, but we can change the fuel—and often that fuel includes our homes.

When Loren Russell, who works for the wildfire division of my regional fire district, came over to assess my risks, what he said surprised me: Instead of the overgrown hill behind the house, which had scared me, he was worried about nooks in the eaves or corners of the deck where embers could get caught. He also worried about the the oily junipers in the yard, which could become ladder fuels that might allow fire to leap to the tree canopies, and about the ways those canopies connected, spreading sparks across the landscape.

Russell says it’s always the same few things that create risk. Looking at the splintering boards of my neighbor’s fence, he noted that he’d seen fires blow across whole subdivisions through fences. “Once embers are in a fence it’s like a wick,” he says.

There are strategies for personal protection, too—and not just for fire. FEMA says that if you live in a hurricane-prone area, you can install impact resistant doors (particularly garage doors), storm shingles, and reinforced roof bracing, all of which help your house withstand storms. If you’re in a floodplain, you can seal cracks in your foundation, move your electrical boxes higher, or build berms and drains into your landscaping so water runs away from your home.

There can be a range of costs for those projects, from your own sweat equity for landscaping to tens of thousands of dollars for a new roof. But there can be grants and tools available to offset some of the cost, like Alabama’s program to help fund home strengthening, which is run through the state insurance office. Check your state resources, like the division of emergency management.

There’s no perfect formula for what to do. Russell says mitigation makes a real difference, but that risk is personal, because it’s also tied up in tolerance, and in trying to predict the future. “You go out and you build a concrete bunker and surround it with gravel, but,” he says, “now you live in a concrete bunker surrounded by gravel.”

Turning your home into a bunker is expensive, unappealing, and it might not make a difference in your broader risk tolerance. And unfortunately, it doesn’t really change your insurance liability. At least not yet.

My insurance agent told me that they don’t yet factor home hardening into their policies and pricing, even though simply being in a disaster-prone area can raise your premiums or make it harder to get insurance—and sometimes, insurance companies will simply dump policy holders in risk-prone areas. More than 100,000 Californians in fire-prone areas have lost their insurance in the past five years.

Those drops don’t necessarily reflect what’s happening on the ground. “We had one insurance agency that was pretty happy to drop people. I looked at their reports and didn’t find them to be based in fire science,” Nielsen says, about our area of western Colorado. He says they’re based on zip codes, which can be relatively arbitrary, instead of on the kind of terrain and fuel supply that actually make a difference to fires. And they almost never reflect mitigation work.

One of the only ways home hardening and mitigation makes a difference for insurance is when it’s done on a neighborhood scale. For instance, in 10 states, communities that have been certified as firewise through the National Fire Protection Association are able to get insurance discounts.

That is reflective of actual risk, “You really are impacted by your neighbor’s property,” says Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California Santa Barbara. He says that the LA wildfires showed just how much broader-scale hardening—or lack thereof—impacts risk. But regional tools, like consistent fire hazard mapping programs, or building code requirements for new construction can significantly reduce risk. That’s true of other natural disasters, too.

Nielsen says that landscape scale problems, like fire, need landscape scale solutions. Home hardening is a piece we can control, but it’s networked into a bigger system of land management, risk tolerance, and policy. When a tornado or a hurricane comes, it doesn’t just hit one house.

Nielsen thinks about what’s commonly called the Swiss cheese model of risk assessment, where multiple layers of protection. This includes everything from personal scale, like hardening your roof to withstand high force winds; to local and regional projects like floodplain mitigation or evacuation planning; to federal tools, like the National Weather Service, or FEMA, which apply to the whole country.

You can visualize each layer as a Swiss cheese slice in a sandwich. They all have holes, ideally, the gaps overlap, and the layers support one another—and stop a threat from becoming catastrophic.

That’s even more true for renters, or people who live in urban areas, who might not have as much control over their own homes, and who are even more impacted by the places around them. Hurricanes have wreaked havoc on major cities. If that’s you, ask your landlord what they’ve done to harden the property, ask about past damage, consider supplemental renters insurance and then get curious about municipal management like storm drains, which divert water away from housing, evacuation routes or fire mitigation, depending on your risks.

Having a lot of layers of swiss cheese is especially important now.

It’s all connected. Preventative mitigation is networked into a broader system, but so is dealing with disasters when they come, whether they’re fires, floods, or storms. Marshalling national resources during and after large-scale disasters has been a federal responsibility since the 1970s. That kind of coordinated response is part of how we plan for natural disasters, but the current administration is planning to cut the budget and scope of FEMA and turn responsibility toward state and local governments, which aren’t always funded or prepared to manage large incidents.

The scientists and field workers I spoke to for this story told me they were worried about the lack of federal investment. Moritz says that he’s concerned about disaster response, but he’s also worried about understanding future preparedness. “Some of the big questions that we don’t have answers for yet rely on big labs and national level funding,” he says. “Research wise, a lot of Forest Service colleagues who do really good work in federal labs have been let go, or lost staff. Those are serious losses that will take a long time to get back from.”

He says that there are still big gaps in the research about exactly how home hardening fits into the puzzle of resilience, and what kind of choices are the most effective, but that in the face of that federal lack of support, the sort of things we can do individually or as a neighborhood collective become even more important.

When there are several fires burning at once—like in Los Angeles earlier this year—responding agencies are spread thin and every person might not be able to depend on their help, Mortiz told me. That makes education shared among neighbors even more important. “That’s the scale you can make a difference,” he said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25010813123789.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-14 04:06:14.505073

STATEMENT OF SENATOR PIA S. CAYETANO

On recent government efforts to curb illegal online gambling

I commend the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for taking concrete steps to hold content creators accountable for promoting illegal online gambling. The agency's Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center has ordered influencers to remove these materials. Their coordination with social media platforms shows a clear intent to enforce accountability.

Likewise, I welcome the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation's (PAGCOR) directive to remove all gambling-related billboards and other public advertisements nationwide. This move to limit the aggressive promotion of gambling is a critical step in creating a safer and more responsible environment for all, especially our youth.

Online gambling has become a silent epidemic, thriving in plain sight and quietly tearing at the fabric of the Filipino family. Students are gambling away their allowances, employees are placing bets during work hours, and parents are left to deal with the consequences of broken trust, addiction, and mounting debt. With smartphones making this vice accessible 24/7, even to minors, it now reaches into our homes, classrooms, and workplaces. What may be thought of as a harmless distraction often spirals into a destructive cycle of dependency and despair.

This is why among the priority bills I filed for the 20th Congress includes the ""Ban on Online Gambling Act"" to explicitly prohibit online gambling in all its forms-especially gambling through e-wallets, restrict its promotion on social media, and raise public awareness about its harms. I will continue to push for policies that protect families, educate the youth, and hold enablers accountable.

I also call on payment platforms like e-wallet providers to take the responsible path and stop enabling these gambling ventures. If we are serious about addressing this issue, everyone--from regulators to service providers--must act in the interest of public welfare.

Let us not allow this vice to quietly take root in our daily lives. The time to act is now.",,N,,2025-07-14 04:06:00.304879

(ENB) stands out as a compelling investment opportunity. The Canadian energy infrastructure giant is undervalued relative to its peers, thanks to underappreciated cash flow resilience and a robust pipeline of growth projects in the U.S. and Canada. Let's dissect why now could be a pivotal moment for this under-the-radar stock.

The Cash Flow Engine: Strong and Expanding

Enbridge's financial health is its cornerstone. In Q1 2025, Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) surged 9% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, driven by record Mainline pipeline throughput (3.2 million barrels per day) and contributions from recent acquisitions like U.S. gas utilities. With DCF comfortably covering its $0.94-per-share dividend (implying a DCF-to-dividend ratio of ~6x), the company's payout remains secure.

Meanwhile, Adjusted EBITDA hit $5.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, fueled by toll escalators on its liquids pipelines and colder weather boosting gas distribution revenue. Even as interest expenses and maintenance capex rose, Enbridge's financial discipline kept its debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 4.9x—within its 4.5–5.0x target range.

Growth Projects: Fueling Future Cash Flows

Enbridge's expansion pipeline is its secret sauce. Key projects include:

1. Mainline System Expansion: Adding 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of incremental capacity by 2027, with $2 billion allocated through 2028. This will transport more oil from Alberta to U.S. refiners, capitalizing on strong Permian Basin production growth.

2. Ingleside Energy Center: Storage capacity is expanding to 20.1 million barrels by year-end, while new marine docks will enhance exports to Asia. The adjacent Houston Oil Terminal (EHOT), coming online in 2026, adds 2.5 million barrels of storage and integrates with the Gray Oak Pipeline.

3. Gray Oak Pipeline: Capacity is being expanded by 120,000 bpd by early 2026, supporting rising Permian crude volumes (projected to grow by 2 million bpd by 2030).

These projects are not speculative; many are already under construction or secured via open seasons. For example, the Southern Illinois Connector, part of the Mainline expansion, concluded its open season in July 2025 with strong shipper commitments.

Valuation: A Discounted Growth Story

Despite its strong fundamentals, Enbridge trades at a 13.3x EV/EBITDA multiple, below its historical median of 15.3x and well below the industry's median of 6.3x. This mispricing is puzzling given its stable cash flows and growth profile.

Compare Enbridge to peers like Chevron (CVX) or TotalEnergies (TTE), which trade at 6–8x EV/EBITDA. Enbridge's higher multiple reflects its growth-heavy asset mix, but it's still attractively priced given its DCF visibility and low-risk projects.

Risks and Mitigants

Regulatory Delays: The proposed Alberta-to-Prince Rupert pipeline, which would transport 1 million bpd of oil sands crude to the Pacific Coast, faces hurdles like Indigenous land claims and federal tanker bans. While a 2030 timeline is likely, this project is not central to near-term cash flows.

Oil Price Volatility: Lower oil prices could reduce demand for infrastructure. However, Enbridge's fee-based model (revenue tied to volumes, not commodity prices) insulates it from price swings.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Discount, Play the Growth

Enbridge is a rare blend of stability and growth. Its cash flows are resilient, its projects are shovel-ready, and its valuation is undemanding. With a DCF-to-enterprise-value ratio of 3.5% (higher than most midstream peers), investors get paid to wait for growth to materialize.

Actionable Takeaway:

- Hold: For long-term investors seeking steady dividends (yield ~6.5%) and exposure to North American energy infrastructure.

- Buy: If the stock dips below $40, given its $5.50–$5.90 annual DCF guidance.

Final Word

Enbridge is a testament to the adage that infrastructure wins in uncertain times. With a $29 billion growth backlog, a fortress balance sheet, and projects aligned with both oil demand and renewable energy goals (e.g., offshore wind in France), it's a play on energy transition—and a bargain at current prices.

In a sector rife with volatility, Enbridge offers a rare mix of safety and upside. For investors willing to look beyond the headlines, this could be the energy stock to watch.

The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).

Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.

The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.

Reaction to the change is mixed

Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.

Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn’t specific about timing.

The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India’s sweltering cities.

“Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this.”

Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.

Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.

If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

Rule changes can nudge consumers to use less energy

The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.

Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.

“People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.

New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.”

“People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.

Indian air conditioners are inefficient

Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.

“Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.

Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn’t be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.

“Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said.

Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.

“Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar.

POWER HUNGRY CHATBOTS Over the past few years, a confluence of events have resulted in skyrocketing power capacity rates at PJM.
Among those, auctions were repeatedly delayed as regulators mulled multiple rule changes at PJM, giving developers less time to plan for power plant construction.
Tech giants started scouring the US power grid for capacity, contributing to the spike in auction prices in 2024.","America’s largest power grid is under strain as data centers and AI chatbots consume power faster than new plants can be built.

Electricity bills are projected to surge by more than 20 per cent this summer in some parts of PJM Interconnection’s territory, which covers 13 states – from Illinois to Tennessee, Virginia to New Jersey – serving 67 million customers in a region with the most data centers in the world.

The governor of Pennsylvania is threatening to abandon the grid, the CEO has announced his departure and the chair of PJM’s board of managers and another board member were voted out.

The upheaval at PJM started a year ago with a more than 800 per cent jump in prices at its annual capacity auction. Rising prices out of the auction trickle down to everyday people’s power bills.

Now PJM is barreling towards its next capacity auction on Wednesday, when prices may rise even further.

The auction aims to avoid blackouts by establishing a rate at which generators agree to pump out electricity during the most extreme periods of stress on the grid, usually the hottest and coldest days of the year.

High prices out of the auction should spur new power plant construction, but that hasn’t happened quickly enough in PJM’s region as aging power plants continue to retire and data center demand explodes.

PJM has made the situation worse by delaying auctions and pausing the application process for new plants, according to more than a dozen power developers, regulators, energy attorneys and other experts interviewed by Reuters.

“We need speed from PJM, we need transparency from PJM and we need to keep consumer costs down with PJM,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told Reuters in an interview. “I think they’ve taken some steps in that direction which is really encouraging to me and we’re going to continue to work at it.”

PJM says the supply and demand crunch has been caused largely by factors outside of its control, including state energy policies that closed fossil-fuel fired power plants prematurely and data center growth in “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia and other burgeoning hubs in the Mid-Atlantic.

“Prices will remain high as long as demand growth is outstripping supply – this is a basic economic policy,” said PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields. “Right now, we need every megawatt we can get.”

New projects totaling about 46 gigawatts – enough capacity to power 40 million homes – have been cleared in recent years, “but are not getting built because of local opposition, supply chain backups or financing issues that have nothing to do with PJM,” Shields said.

PJM has lost more than 5.6 net gigawatts in the last decade as power plants shut faster than new ones enter service, according to a PJM presentation filed with regulators this year. PJM added about 5 gigawatts of power-generating capacity in 2024, fewer than smaller grids in California and Texas.

Meanwhile, data center demand is surging. By 2030, PJM expects 32 gigawatts of increased demand on its system, with all but two of those gigawatts coming from data centers.

POWER HUNGRY CHATBOTS

Over the past few years, a confluence of events have resulted in skyrocketing power capacity rates at PJM.

Among those, auctions were repeatedly delayed as regulators mulled multiple rule changes at PJM, giving developers less time to plan for power plant construction.

In 2022, PJM stopped processing new applications for power plant connections after it was overloaded with more than 2,000 requests from renewable power projects, each of which required engineering studies before they could connect to the grid. PJM says its interconnection queue has not led to the supply shortfall.

Then, in 2023, ChatGPT became a household name and demand exploded. Tech giants started scouring the US power grid for capacity, contributing to the spike in auction prices in 2024.

Consumer advocates from Maryland, New Jersey and other states filed complaints with federal regulators, asking for a re-do of the auction.

Shapiro has made repeated threats to remove Pennsylvania, the biggest electricity exporting state and the “P” in PJM, from the grid if it didn’t bring costs down. Asked in June if leaving PJM is still on the table, the governor told Reuters: “It is.”

During the fallout, PJM’s CEO Manu Asthana announced in April that he would leave his post at the end of the year, citing a family move to Texas.

Asthana did not respond to requests for comment.

Citing fears of blackouts, the Trump administration in May ordered two oil and natural gas power plants in Pennsylvania, both scheduled to retire in May, to continue operating through the summer.

CONNECTION DELAYS

In response to the backlash, PJM has made multiple reforms, including capping prices at $325 per megawatt-day and holding auctions every six months instead of annually, Shields said.

PJM also moved to fast-track connections of 51 power projects to its system, but many of those are still expected to take until 2030 or 2031 to come online.

Among them is Constellation Energy’s Three Mile Island nuclear plant, rechristened Crane Clean Energy Center, which is being restarted under contract from Microsoft. Even under PJM’s expedited plan, the plant isn’t expected to start up until at least 2027.

Despite the reforms, PJM isn’t processing new applications fast enough, said Joshua Macey, an energy expert and associate professor at Yale Law School. “It’s pointless if they haven’t fixed the interconnection queue,” he said.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/energy-plant.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 05:10:31.008994

As the 2024–2025 political cycle unfolds, the U.S. clean energy industry is acting like it’s in a race against the clock.","Introduction: Policy Whiplash Fuels a Renewable Rush

The U.S. renewable energy sector is experiencing a paradoxical surge. While long-term clarity is clouded by shifting political winds and looming legislative threats, short-term deployment of clean energy technologies is accelerating. Developers, manufacturers, and utilities are racing to lock in federal tax credits, finalize financing, and break ground on projects before any potential rollback of incentives or regulatory shifts materialize.

This phenomenon, what some are calling a “policy-induced urgency, ” is a defining feature of the current renewable energy landscape. With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) still largely intact but increasingly under scrutiny, stakeholders are seizing the moment. On July 4, 2025, the U.S. Congress passed and President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB, H.R.1). This sweeping tax package includes provisions that accelerate the phase-out of critical clean energy tax credits. In response, developers are front-loading activity, driving record-breaking quarters in manufacturing, construction, and energy storage.

This article explores how uncertainty about U.S. climate and energy policy is paradoxically fueling a short-term boom. It examines five key areas where action has accelerated in recent months, driven not just by incentives, but by the fear of losing them.

Surging Solar Manufacturing: A Preemptive Sprint

One of the most direct outcomes of recent policy ambiguity has been the record-breaking surge in solar module manufacturing capacity. According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. added 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module capacity in Q2 2025, one of the strongest quarters in U.S. history. Developers are moving fast to capture tax credits before potential reversals.

The trigger? The BBB legislation outlines a sharp sunset for many renewable incentives. The Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) will now expire on December 31, 2025, cutting short its original duration. Similarly, the Commercial Investment Tax Credit (Section 48) for solar and wind will terminate after December 31, 2027. Although these dates leave a short window for deployment, the compressed timeline has caused manufacturers to accelerate operations dramatically.

This flurry of activity demonstrates the fragile confidence in long-term federal support. Manufacturers are hedging against risk by compressing what might have been a five-year plan into the next 12–18 months.

Battery Storage Builds Soar Amid Credit Clock Watching

The same urgency is seen in energy storage. With federal tax credits for standalone storage newly introduced via the IRA, developers are rushing to complete projects while the regulatory environment still favors rapid deployment.

In Nevada, the Reid Gardner Battery Energy Storage System, a 220 MW / 440 MWh project, was recently commissioned with the help of $100 million in federal support. Across the country, similar projects are being fast-tracked. Developers anticipate that changes in Congress could revise credit structures or add new compliance burdens, reducing the economic attractiveness of new builds.

Under BBB, standalone and retrofit battery credits (under Section 48E) remain technically available through 2032, but eligibility is narrowed to leased or PPA-tied systems, and cross-subsidies are under review. As a result, developers are bundling battery projects with solar deployments to maximize near-term credit access.

Recent Utility-Scale Battery Storage Projects (Q4 2024–Q2 2025)

This rush to deploy before the “policy window” closes is producing what the U.S. Energy Information Administration calls a “2025 supercycle” in battery installations, growth that is unlikely to persist at the same pace without long-term policy stability.

Offshore Wind Races to Approval Before Regulatory Shifts

While solar and storage are seeing development peaks, the offshore wind sector is undergoing a fast-tracked permitting spree. The Biden administration, via the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), has accelerated project reviews, approving multiple multi-gigawatt developments in recent months.

Notable examples include:

Maryland Offshore Wind (US Wind) – 2.2 GW project approved in December 2024

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind – 2.6 GW under construction, 50% complete

Sunrise Wind (New York) – 924 MW began turbine installations in early 2025

These projects are being shepherded through while federal support remains robust, but developers acknowledge the precariousness of the moment. Under BBB, the commercial ITC for offshore wind will expire after December 31, 2027, and developers must begin construction by mid-2026 to qualify. These deadlines are pushing utilities to speed up permitting and equipment contracts.

As one executive noted, “We are trying to get everything locked down while we still can count on the rules not changing.” This sense of urgency is driving permitting acceleration and supply chain finalizations.

Manufacturers Hedging Bets With Accelerated Factory Builds

The IRA’s domestic content incentives were designed to bring clean energy manufacturing back to U.S. soil, and they’ve succeeded. But with BBB curtailing the duration of these benefits, manufacturers are pushing to begin production before the window closes.

Since 2022, over 120 new clean tech factories have been announced in the U.S. These include solar cell fabs, battery gigafactories, and EV component plants. In the first half of 2025 alone, $34 billion in new investments were publicly committed, most aiming to begin operations before 2027.

Table 2: Selected U.S. Clean Energy Manufacturing Announcements (H1 2025)

These companies are front-loading capital expenditures to ensure eligibility for IRA credits, and to establish market presence before political tides turn. The result: a short-term spike in economic activity, jobs, and industrial output that may taper if uncertainty persists.

Conclusion: Racing Against the Clock

The U.S. renewable energy sector is experiencing a rare alignment of incentives and anxiety. Strong policies like the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are catalyzing clean energy growth, but political developments such as the BBB are injecting new uncertainty into the system. Rather than stall activity, this has triggered a short-term boom, as developers and manufacturers rush to capitalize on current rules before they potentially disappear.

This dynamic is unsustainable in the long run. Bursts of growth followed by periods of uncertainty make it difficult for supply chains to stabilize, for skilled labor to be developed, and for communities to trust the energy transition. Nonetheless, in the short term, policy instability has become an accelerator rather than a brake.

As the 2024–2025 political cycle unfolds, the U.S. clean energy industry is acting like it’s in a race against the clock. The outcome will determine whether the recent boom is a foundation for long-term resilience, or merely a surge before a slowdown.

The development follows collaboration with Dr Binesh Puthen Veetti and his team at Macquarie University, who have pioneered new silver extraction technology.

The company has secured global rights to the university’s proprietary “Microwave Joule Heating Technology” (MJHT), designed to recover metals from solar panel waste. The technology enables energy-efficient recovery of valuable materials from discarded solar panels.

Alongside silver, solar panels also contain other critical elements such as silicon, gallium and indium — metals vital to advanced semiconductor manufacturing and renewable energy systems.

Silver fingers and busbars on a solar panel transport electricity.

The company is also preparing to assess a new silver extraction process developed by the same university team. This secondary technology is distinct from MJHT and will be formally presented to Lithium Universe after patent finalisation.

Silver demand is forecast to reach a record 680 million ounces in 2025, with industrial use growing at a 7% compound annual growth rate. A supply deficit of around 117.6 million ounces is expected. Since 2018, silver prices have surged by 126% to US$34 per ounce, highlighting the economic incentive to recover the metal from solar waste.

“While solar panels contain many critical metals and minerals, the follow-up extraction of these materials needs to be prioritised. Due to the large volume of residual material, rising prices, and supply shortages, the company plans to focus on silver extraction as the first phase. Once we address silver extraction, we can then explore the extraction and recovery of other critical metals like silicon, indium, and gallium — critical in advanced semiconductor and solar energy technologies.”

Surging silver demand driven by solar energy boom

Silver demand is rapidly escalating, underpinned by its critical role in solar panel manufacturing. Each panel typically contains about 20 grams of silver, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 8 grams per square metre. At a spot price of US$34 per ounce, the silver content equates to approximately A$36 per panel.

Silver 10-year price trend.

Silver demand driven by PV cells.

Photovoltaics (PV) have become a major consumer of silver, and their growing deployment — particularly in markets such as Australia — is intensifying demand. Australia’s target of 82% renewable energy generation by 2030, alongside a planned 43% cut in emissions, is driving large-scale solar adoption.

The global industrial demand for silver is forecast to grow at 7% annually, with total consumption expected to reach a record 680 million ounces in 2025. PV and artificial intelligence (AI) are now among the fastest-growing sectors driving this expansion.

Silver remains both costly and finite, primarily sourced from argentite ores via smelting or chemical processing. However, production has not kept pace with rising consumption. A projected market shortfall of around 117.6 million ounces in 2025 continues a pattern of deficits that has placed upward pressure on prices.

Reflecting these dynamics, silver prices have surged 126% over the past seven years, rising from US$15 per ounce in 2018 to US$34 per ounce in 2025.

Potential silver extraction technology to complement MJHT platform

In June 2025, Lithium Universe entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Macquarie University for its MJHT, a platform that employs targeted microwave energy to selectively heat silicon wafers within photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, softening the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) thermoplastic encapsulant. This process enables efficient room-temperature delamination, allowing for the recovery of valuable materials without the extreme heat (up to 1,400°C) or hazardous chemicals typically used in conventional recycling methods.

The delamination approach avoids mechanical crushing, reducing material cross-contamination and improving recovery efficiency.

As a follow-on to this process, Macquarie University’s Dr Binesh and his research team have developed a complementary silver extraction technology tailored for delaminated silicon wafers derived from the MJHT process. This silver recovery method is currently undergoing patent submission. Upon completion, the licence for the new technology will be offered to Lithium Universe.

While the company has not yet formally assessed the new silver extraction technology, it has initiated independent research and patent investigations to identify the most effective methods for recovering silver from end-of-life solar panels.

Why silver recycling is a lucrative opportunity

Global solar panel waste is projected to surge from 8 million tonnes in 2030 to between 60 and 78 million tonnes by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). In Australia alone, the accumulated waste is expected to reach 1 million tonnes by 2035, equating to an estimated value of over A$1 billion. Despite the scale of this challenge, only 15% of used photovoltaic (PV) cells are currently recycled, with the majority sent to landfill due to costly, inefficient methods that require high heat and hazardous chemicals.

The silver content in solar modules offers a compelling case for change. Each panel contains around 20 grams of silver — approximately A$36 at current prices. The Australian Smart Energy Council notes that the aggregate silver in these panels is equivalent to the output of Australia’s largest silver mine. As demand for silver accelerates in sectors such as electronics and renewable energy, this underutilised resource presents a significant and scalable recycling opportunity.

Lithium Universe aims to capitalise on this opportunity.

Unlocking value from critical and strategic metals

In its second phase, LU7 plans to explore recovery pathways for other critical metals found in PV panels, including silicon, gallium and indium. These materials are vital to both the clean energy transition and advanced semiconductor applications. However, their supply chains are concentrated, with China accounting for around 80% of global gallium output and over 60% of indium production.

Gallium is primarily obtained as a by-product of aluminium smelting, while indium is produced during zinc mining. Other sources include Germany, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine (gallium), and Canada and Peru (indium), with refining activity centred in Japan and South Korea.

Given their strategic importance and supply risk, domestic recycling of these metals from end-of-life solar panels offers potential for both economic resilience and technology sovereignty.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzA3XC8yMDI1LTA3LTE0LTExLTI2LTU2LTEwZDM3MGNiYTc4M2I2NTBlNDFkM2NmNWRkMGUzOTc0LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-07-14 06:11:42.037890

However, Northvolt is just a typical example of the huge amount of money spent by the European battery industry.
If abandoned halfway, it will bring a heavier transformation burden to the European automobile industry.
The low - risk production capacities of the two countries reach 115 GWh and 125 GWh respectively.
Since last year, more and more European automobile manufacturers have slowed down the electrification process.","The European Federation for Transport and Environment (T & E for short) recently released a research report titled ""European Automobiles at a Crossroads"". The report points out that the European automobile industry is at a critical juncture. Whether the ""combustion engine ban"" proposal is advanced or delayed will have completely different impacts and directions on the entire industry.

On the one hand, there has been an obvious chain reaction of declining sales of electric vehicles in Europe. According to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), the sales of electric vehicles in the EU decreased by 5.9% in 2024, and this year they also face the threat of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. With pure electric vehicles not selling well for a long time, the plan to stop selling fuel - powered vehicles in the 27 EU countries by 2035 has cast a new shadow.

On the other hand, if no remedial measures are taken and the EU abandons the goal of banning the sale of fuel - powered vehicles within its territory by 2035, the entire European automobile industry may lose 1 million jobs. Most of the efforts made for ""zero - emissions"" will go to waste, and the investment losses in new energy sectors such as batteries will be as high as two - thirds.

It's a dilemma of neither advancing nor retreating.

In the strategy of electrification transformation, the EU has found itself in an awkward situation. Due to the sluggish sales of pure electric vehicles, many automobile manufacturers have successively lowered their short - and medium - term sales targets, forcing the EU to have room to relax the carbon dioxide emission targets. However, to date, the EU still adheres to the established plan of completely banning the sale of fossil - fuel vehicles by 2035.

This report from T & E clearly supports the continuous advancement of the ""combustion engine ban"". The report comments that if the EU adheres to the clean energy target for 2035 and implements the transitional policies, the European automobile industry is expected to return to the level of producing 16.8 million new vehicles per year, reaching the peak level after the 2008 economic crisis.

In a nutshell, if the ""combustion engine ban"" is abandoned halfway, the sunk costs will be extremely high, and there is also a risk of large - scale unemployment. T & E data shows that if the EU maintains the ""combustion engine ban"" target for 2035 and implements a package of policies to promote the development of emerging industrial chains, by 2035, the contribution of the automobile industry to the European economy will increase by 11%.

Employment and Industrial Chain Value

To support the continuous advancement of the ""combustion engine ban"", the T & E report presents several important data:

If the EU can implement the ""combustion engine ban"" until 2030, the job losses in the traditional automobile manufacturing field may be offset by more than 100,000 jobs created in new electrification fields such as batteries. By 2035, the number of jobs in the new energy field of the automobile industry will reach 120,000, mainly concentrated in industrial chains such as batteries and electric drives.

As long as Europe can ensure a battery manufacturing capacity of more than 900 GWh, it can create more than 100,000 new jobs, and the number of jobs created will reach 120,000 by 2035. In addition, the economic output of the battery industrial chain will increase to about five times, reaching 79 billion euros.

The report points out that if the established ""combustion engine ban"" target is weakened, or if the EU's policies waver and there is a lack of a comprehensive industrial transformation plan, by 2035, the economic contribution of the automobile industry may decrease by 90 billion euros (equivalent to about 758 billion yuan), and the economic contribution of the charging market will accumulate a loss of 20 million euros (equivalent to about 168 million yuan).

Regarding the sunk costs of the industrial chain, T & E conducted a study on 13 new electric vehicle projects in Europe. Among them, 5 projects are brand - new electric vehicle factories, and the remaining 8 are transformed from existing fuel - powered vehicle production lines.

If all the projects are successfully implemented, Europe will add at least 2.1 million electric vehicle production capacities annually, and the total production is expected to reach 5.1 million by 2027, which is sufficient to meet the growing market demand. This figure will be achieved on the basis of the 1.8 million production in the whole of Europe in 2024. According to T & E statistics, the sales of pure electric vehicles in Europe (including the EU, the UK, European Free Trade Association countries, and Serbia) were about 2 million in 2024, while the production was close to 1.8 million in the same year.

However, due to the uncertainty of the future market prospects and policies, some projects face the risk of delay or even cancellation. T & E evaluated all 13 projects based on four key criteria, including the project status (delayed/started/testing phase), construction progress (not started/under construction/completed), whether the factory site is determined, and whether there is a government subsidy commitment. According to the evaluation results, these 13 projects are divided into three risk levels: low, medium, and high, to reflect the possibility of investment implementation.

The low - risk projects include the BMW factory in Hungary and the Volvo factory in Slovakia, both of which are brand - new; as well as the Stellantis factory in Serbia and the Volkswagen and Chery factories in Spain, which are converted from existing fuel - powered vehicle production capacities to electric vehicle production capacities. These projects will form a total annual production capacity of 550,000 vehicles, drive an investment of about 4.8 billion euros, and create at least 5,550 jobs.

The medium - risk projects have a total planned annual production capacity of 1.2 million vehicles, involve an investment of 9.3 billion euros, and can support 11,000 jobs. Among them, BYD's Szeged factory in Hungary, with an investment of 4 billion euros, accounts for nearly half of the total, making it the largest project on the list; followed by the transformation project of the Seat - Volkswagen factory in Spain, with a cumulative investment of 3 billion euros; and the upgrading production bases of Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan in the UK, which are expected to produce a total of 250,000 electric vehicles annually, similar to the plan of the Volvo factory in Gothenburg.

The high - risk projects include three, all of which are in the early development stage, or there are still uncertainties about the final investment decision or start - up date. Among them, there is the suspension of the 700 - million - euro electrification transformation of the Oxford MINI factory by BMW, and the plan to build a factory in Serbia through a joint venture between Renault and China's Jiangling.

Batteries and Supporting Facilities

What needs to be weighed between sunk costs and strategic shifts is not only the vehicle manufacturing but also the huge investment in key components such as batteries.

Previously, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) statistics showed that China currently supplies about 80% of the world's lithium - ion batteries. Six of the world's top 10 electric vehicle battery manufacturers are from China. Europe has invested 36 billion US dollars (equivalent to 232 billion yuan) in the development of automotive power batteries, but 12 out of 16 local battery factories have encountered production delays or cancellations, and the situation is not optimistic.

Northvolt, once hailed as the ""light of European batteries"", applied for bankruptcy protection in Sweden. After burning through 14 billion US dollars (equivalent to about 100 billion yuan), it withdrew dejectedly, marking a huge setback for Europe's ambition to challenge China in the field of power batteries. However, Northvolt is just a typical example of the huge amount of money spent by the European battery industry. In addition to this well - known star company, Europe has also spent a lot of money on other battery companies in the past few years and gradually established its own battery energy storage industrial chain. If abandoned halfway, it will bring a heavier transformation burden to the European automobile industry.

Similarly, T & E evaluated the battery factories in Europe based on multiple key criteria, and the data shows that:

The low - risk battery factories have all received the necessary funds and have started construction. Some factories have even been put into production, which will bring an annual production capacity of 391 GWh to Europe, with an investment of 39 billion euros and the creation of up to 43,000 technical jobs. The ACC factory in Douvrain, France, and the Volkswagen PowerCo project in Salzgitter, Germany, belong to this category.

The medium - risk projects have not started construction mainly because the final investment decision has not been made. This is currently the largest category in the European battery field, involving an annual production capacity of 627 GWh, an investment of 48 billion euros, and 47,000 potential jobs. Compared with low - risk projects, there are many uncertainties in this type of factories. A representative project is Basquevolt in Spain, where most of the production capacity will be allocated to emerging fields such as solid - state batteries.

The high - risk projects are still in the conceptual or approval stage. Although they will include a total annual production capacity of 410 GWh, an investment of 21 billion euros, and 37,000 job opportunities, their advancement completely depends on subsequent industrial policies.

T & E analysis shows that in terms of actual expected output (not theoretical capacity), Europe's local production capacity may meet two - thirds of its local battery demand by 2030.

However, if only the low - risk projects are finally implemented, this proportion will drop sharply to 24%, far lower than the EU's 2030 target of 40% self - sufficiency rate. After including the medium - risk projects, the self - sufficiency rate can reach 52%, but this figure is also lower than the previous estimates of T & E and the EU. Affected by unfavorable global and EU factors (such as insufficient industrial support), many battery projects are at risk of cancellation or delay.

Taking Spain as an example, in terms of policy support, the country has shown great development potential and plans to achieve an annual production capacity of 244 GWh by 2030. However, only 13% of it belongs to low - risk projects, and the realization of most of the production capacity still depends on future policy directions.

In contrast, the development prospects of Poland and Hungary are clearer. The low - risk production capacities of the two countries reach 115 GWh and 125 GWh respectively. Although Poland has no plan to build new factories for the time being, Hungary is expected to add another 90 GWh of production capacity and may become a new center of the European electric vehicle industry in the future.

Major automobile economies such as France and Germany are in the middle position in the battery manufacturing field. The total production capacity of the two countries exceeds 350 GWh, of which 130 GWh belongs to low - risk projects.

Since last year, more and more European automobile manufacturers have slowed down the electrification process. The top priority for the EU is not only to re - examine its electrification strategy, find a balance between industrial policies, infrastructure, and market demand, but also to consider the input - output ratio of the original investment and how to calculate the sunk costs if the policy is slowed down or stopped.

This account is really hard to calculate because in addition to the huge investment of automobile enterprises, there are also huge ""money - burning"" pits in supporting facilities such as batteries. And behind it, there are millions of local jobs involved.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250714/v2_59ed0279110747298c576fc5f1a02324@000000@ai_oswg354499oswg1536oswg722_img_000~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:05:56.037730

With the transition from the widely used CCS (Combined Charging System) to the NACS (North American Charging Standard) beginning in 2025, GM aims to unify charging standards across the industry. Cadillac’s upcoming 2026 OPTIQ and OPTIQ-V models will be the first GM vehicles equipped with native NACS ports, allowing direct access to Tesla Superchargers without adapters.

Home Charging Made Easy

For everyday use, GM promotes home charging as the most convenient and cost-effective method. Two levels are supported:

Level 1 (120-volt): A standard outlet offering 3–5 miles of range per hour—ideal for short commutes.

Level 2 (240-volt): Significantly faster, providing up to 40 miles of range per hour.

GM Energy’s PowerUp 2 and PowerShift chargers allow overnight charging and even vehicle-to-home (V2H) energy backup during power outages, especially when paired with the V2H Enablement Kit. Preferred installation partners like Qmerit ensure a smooth setup process.

Public Charging Across North America

With access to over 250,000 charging stations through partnerships with EVgo, ChargePoint, and Pilot/Flying J—and now more than 21,500 Tesla Superchargers via GM-approved NACS adapters—GM EV owners can confidently travel long distances. The upcoming IONNA Rechargery network, a joint venture with other automakers, is expected to further expand fast-charging availability along key highways.

New GM EVs come equipped with Google Maps and built-in route planning to locate and filter nearby chargers, including availability and speed. The GM brand apps further simplify public charging by linking with provider networks and supporting Plug and Charge—a technology that allows automatic payment and authentication just by plugging in.

Charging Etiquette and Performance Tips

The guide also highlights proper charging behavior: vacating spots after an 80% charge, avoiding unnecessary use of shared power stations, and never unplugging other vehicles. Charging speeds may vary due to battery temperature, usage history, and other conditions, but pre-conditioning and charging to 80% are advised for daily use.

Spanning 360,000 square meters and with a designed capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year, this marks VinFast’s fifth manufacturing facility worldwide, highlighting the Vietnamese brand’s remarkable execution speed and strong industrial capabilities.

The Hà Tĩnh plant is VinFast’s second EV manufacturing site to officially go into production, and the fifth project within the company’s developing global production network. With construction and equipment installation completed in under seven months, VinFast Hà Tĩnh is one of the fastest-built automobile factories in the world to date.

The factory covers a total area of 360,000 square meters and includes key workshops such as the Body Welding Shop, Painting Shop, General Assembly Shop, a Logistics Warehouse, and a Quality Control Center. In addition, a 240,000-square-meter auxiliary cluster is under construction, with plans for further expansion in the coming years.

VinFast Hà Tĩnh is equipped with one of Southeast Asia’s most advanced and highly automated production lines, featuring state-of-the-art technologies from leading global partners such as ABB, DÜRR, FANUC, and SIEMENS. All manufacturing processes strictly comply with international standards including ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and IATF 16949 (Automotive Quality Management Systems).

In its initial phase, the plant has a design capacity of approximately 200,000 vehicles per year, with an average output of 35 vehicles per hour. Future plans include expanding capacity to meet growing market demand.

To optimize production lines during the early stages, the Hà Tĩnh plant will focus on compact urban EV models such as the VF 3, Minio Green, EC Van, and several upcoming models currently in development. Vehicles produced at the plant will serve both the domestic market and international exports.

The facility is expected to create approximately 6,000 direct jobs in its initial phase, with the potential to expand its workforce to 15,000 in the future, supporting local employment and contributing to the region’s socioeconomic development. Additionally, the presence of VinFast Hà Tĩnh is expected to attract auxiliary partners to set up operations in the industrial zone, creating a synchronized supply chain and advancing the goal of reaching over 80% localization in electric vehicle production by 2026.

In the first five months of 2025, VinFast has become the top-selling auto brand in Vietnam, delivering over 56,000 vehicles. The VF 3, VF 5, and VF 6 models have been among the bestsellers. VinFast EVs are also gaining traction in international markets such as the Philippines and Indonesia.

According to the ICCT, regular hybrids produce about 20 percent fewer emissions than petrol cars.
More Buyers Are Choosing Electric Electric vehicles are not just cleaner.","Electric cars are becoming a powerful solution to climate change. A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) has found that battery electric vehicles (EVs) now create 73 percent less pollution over their lifetime compared to petrol cars. This is a major improvement and shows just how fast clean technology is moving.

A Huge Drop in Emissions

The ICCT study shows that modern electric cars produce only 63 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre over their full life. This includes everything from building the car to driving it and scrapping it. Petrol cars, in comparison, release about 235 grams for every kilometre.

This shows how much cleaner EVs have become. In fact, the 73 percent reduction is 24 percent better than similar results from four years ago.

As Dr. Marta Negri, the lead researcher, explains, ""Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids.""

Battery Manufacturing: Less of a Problem Now

People often say electric vehicles pollute more when they are built because of the battery. It’s true that battery-making creates more emissions at the start. In fact, 40 to 60 percent of an EV’s production emissions come from the battery.

But this extra pollution is made up quickly once the EV is on the road. The study found that an electric car becomes cleaner than a petrol car after just 17,000 kilometres. That’s about one to two years of regular use. As battery factories improve and power grids become cleaner, this gap is closing even faster.

Cleaner Electricity Means Cleaner EVs

Electric vehicles do even better when they are charged with clean power like wind or solar energy. In that case, the total emissions drop by 78 percent compared to petrol cars, going down to just 52 grams of CO2 per kilometre.

This also proves that where your electricity comes from really matters. Even in areas where power comes from coal or gas, EVs still perform better because electric motors are much more efficient. While petrol engines convert only 16 to 25 percent of fuel into motion, electric motors convert up to 91 percent of electricity into movement.

Hybrids Lag Behind

Some people think hybrid cars are a good middle ground. But the numbers tell a different story. According to the ICCT, regular hybrids produce about 20 percent fewer emissions than petrol cars. Plug-in hybrids do slightly better, reducing emissions by 30 percent. Still, this is far behind the 73 percent cut achieved by full electric vehicles.

This makes one thing clear. While hybrids help a little, going fully electric makes the biggest difference for the environment.

More Buyers Are Choosing Electric

Electric vehicles are not just cleaner. They are also becoming more popular. In 2024, EV sales reached over 17 million units worldwide, growing by 25 percent from the previous year. This rise is being driven by better batteries, more charging points, and rising awareness of climate change.

Transport is one of the hardest sectors to make greener. But this new research proves that EVs are not just moving pollution somewhere else. They are actually cutting it down in a real and measurable way.

A Cleaner Future Is in Motion

The 73 percent drop in emissions is only the beginning. As battery technology improves and more power comes from renewable sources, electric vehicles will become even cleaner.

For people thinking about their next car, the answer is becoming clearer. EVs are not just cleaner on the road. They are cleaner throughout their whole life, from the factory to the driveway.

This shift is more than just a change in vehicles. It is a sign that the world is moving toward a better, cleaner way to travel. As more countries support electric cars and cut back on petrol and diesel, this study shows a real way forward. Electric vehicles are leading the way into a cleaner future for all.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/electric_cars_72_cleaner_than_petrol_cars_featured_0b308f2b0e.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 00:02:45.001212

Citing BPA’s own analysis demonstrating increased costs for consumers, along with the potential to weaken energy grid reliability and access to clean energy, the groups say the plan violates BPA’s obligations to consumers and the environment, according to a release.

“Energy prices have already skyrocketed across the Northwest over the past few years. People are struggling,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, in a statement. “BPA benefits immensely from the power generated in our region, but its responsibilities to Northwest utility customers rise above what works best for BPA. It must ensure the people in our region aren’t financially harmed by this hasty decision.”

BPA announced in May that it would join Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+ day-ahead market rather than continue in the “real time” market under the California Independent System Operator.

Agency officials said the move will yield economic benefits for its customers and more equitable management of the region’s energy resources.

The groups have petitioned the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to review BPA’s decision. Along with Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, the other parties include NW Energy Coalition, Idaho Conservation League, Sierra Club and Montana Environmental Information Center. They are being represented by environmental law firm Earthjustice.

“Bonneville’s decision on markets will affect the transmission and generation of electric power across the West and is exactly the type of major federal action that should first consider the harms it could cause to our air quality, grid system reliability, fish and wildlife, etc. This is exactly why Congress enacted NEPA – to examine the consequences before acting. Here, however, the agency has completely ignored its obligations under federal law,” said Jaimini Parekh, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, in a statement.

Officials with power utilities in the Tri-Cities region have said they have no concerns the move will pull power from the Tri-Cities; BPA is legally required to provide power to the 140 consumer-owned utilities in the region, which includes Benton REA, Benton PUD and Franklin PUD.

Those same officials have praised BPA’s decision, anticipating a greater likelihood of cost benefits since BPA would no longer have to adjust its operations in a way that would more likely benefit California ratepayers over the others it serves.

“It’s that element of governance, this will move to a collective conglomerate,” Ryan Redmond, CEO of Benton REA, previously told the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business. “It’s a solid and more equitable model for us to work from.”",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/2025/02/19/Ice-Harbor-Lock-and-Dam.jpg?height=635&t=1740001491&width=1200,N,,2025-07-13 23:04:11.457948

The article The GOP Megabill: What Taxpayers Should Know originally appeared on NerdWallet.","The sprawling budget bill signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on July 4 after it squeaked through Congress has many far-reaching effects for consumers, as well as for the economy at large. Taxes top the list.

The almost 900-page “big, beautiful bill” has plenty to say about taxes, and an array of changes, new credits and deductions are part of the new bill. But at its heart, the bill is about extending the tax provisions passed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, during Trump’s first administration.

Many 2017 tax cuts now permanent

“You know, everyone's focused on changing this and changing that, but the main point of this law was to extend or make permanent a lot of the provisions that were in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” says Evan Morgan, a CPA and principal in tax advisory services at Kaufman Rossin, a Miami-based accounting firm.

The clock was ticking on many of the 2017 changes, which were set to revert to earlier levels at the end of 2025.

“They were due to expire and go back to a higher rate,” Morgan says. “They said, ‘No, no, we’re going to make that permanent.’”

Tax brackets

In tax year 2017, tax rates ranged from 10% to 39.6%. The TJCA lowered the top rate, for top earners, to 37%. That range is now made permanent in the “big, beautiful bill,” which also makes provisions to adjust certain income thresholds — or brackets — for inflation in future years.

Standard deduction

Increases in the standard deduction enacted in 2017 were also due to expire, and the new bill not only makes them permanent, but raises them again and makes them active in tax year 2025 (for taxes filed in 2026).

The new standard deduction levels are:

Single filers and married filing separately: Increases from $15,000 to $15,750.

Married filing jointly: Increases from $30,000 to $31,500.

Heads of household: Increases from $22,500 to $23,625.

In tax year 2017, before the TCJA, standard deductions were $6,350 for individuals, $12,700 for those married filing jointly and $9,350 for heads of household.

State and local tax deduction

Before the TJCA, there was no cap on the amount a taxpayer could deduct for certain state and local taxes paid. The 2017 act set a $10,000 cap, set to expire at the end of 2025 — and then revert to no cap.

The new bill sets a new cap at $40,000 in tax year 2025, rising 1% to $40,400 in 2026. In tax year 2029, it reverts to $10,000.

The state and local (SALT) deduction is available only for taxpayers who itemize rather than take the standard deduction, and there are limitations for high earners. Still, it can be worth exploring, particularly for homeowners.

“Even in a non-tax state like Florida, it doesn't take that expensive of a home to get you to $10,000 in property taxes,” says Morgan. “Now that limit has been raised from 10 to 40.”

Child tax credit

In 2017, the TCJA temporarily raised the maximum child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. The credit was due to revert to $1,000 at the end of this year. The legislation raises the maximum credit to $2,200 for the current year, adjusts it for inflation going forward, and makes it permanent.

What’s new in the ‘big, beautiful bill’?

Senior deduction

During his campaign, Trump pledged to eliminate income taxes some Americans over 65 pay on their Social Security benefits. Instead, the bill adds a new deduction for qualifying taxpayers:

$6,000 for eligible individuals.

$12,000 for married couples filing jointly if both spouses are 65 or older.

The deduction is temporary, ending after tax year 2028, and is layered on top of the standard deduction available to all taxpayers and the additional senior standard deduction. To get the full deduction, eligible taxpayers must have $75,000 or less in modified adjusted gross income ($150,000 or less for joint filers).

No taxes on tips/overtime

Trump also campaigned on ending taxes on tips and overtime, and the new legislation enacts both pledges — temporarily. Unless Congress takes further action, these provisions will expire after tax year 2028. Both take effect this tax year (for taxes filed in 2026).

On tips:

Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct up to $25,000 in “qualified” tips from their income.

Tipped workers will still be on the hook for payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare.

There are limitations on industries included, as well as a gradual phaseout of the deduction above certain modified adjusted gross income thresholds ($150,000 for individuals; $300,000 for couples).

On overtime:

Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct up to $12,500 against their overtime pay. This doubles to $25,000 for qualified joint filers.

The deduction applies to any amount paid over the worker’s base pay.

The deduction is reduced after the same thresholds as the tips provision.

Deduction for car loan interest

This deduction is designed to boost U.S. auto manufacturing, so there are built-in limits on qualifying. This deduction is available starting in tax year 2025 (taxes filed in 2026) and expires after tax year 2028.

The basics:

Taxpayers can write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans.

Taxpayers don’t have to itemize to claim the deduction.

The restrictions:

The car must be new and purchased after Dec. 31, 2024.

The car must be assembled in the United States.

The deduction is reduced — potentially down to $0 — for individuals earning more than $100,000 per year (or joint filers earning more than $200,000).

Tax breaks for small businesses

There are numerous tax provisions in the bill that affect businesses of all sizes, including small businesses.

“The two biggest ones that we're going to deal with is the restoration of bonus depreciation and the enhancement of Section 179 expense for businesses that buy fixed assets,” says Morgan, who specializes in working with small businesses.

Changes to the bonus depreciation will allow businesses to deduct 100% of the cost of new “qualified property” (certain kinds of machinery and other “short-lived” assets) acquired after Jan. 19, 2025.

The TCJA set a 100% deduction back in 2017, but it began phasing out in 2022. Before the latest changes, the deduction would have been 40% in the current tax year.

“So in other words, if I spent a million dollars on things like computers and desks and chairs and furniture and fixtures, as a business, I was only going to get a 40% bonus appreciation deduction in 2025,” says Morgan. “That has now been changed retroactively … and it's gone back to 100%. So that's going to be pretty big.”

Section 179 allows businesses to deduct the cost of certain assets at full value, rather than a depreciated cost. The “big, beautiful bill” raises the limit for this kind of deduction from $1 million to $2.5 million.

There are many more changes that have impacts for business owners, and there are nuances to the two changes listed above. For details, business owners should consult with a tax advisor.

Good news for online sellers

Morgan did highlight one additional change that will be of interest to those who sell items online through platforms like Etsy, Venmo and eBay.

The threshold for reporting sales was reduced to $600 annually in the American Rescue Plan of 2021, though implementation of the new limit had been delayed.

The new budget bill reinstates the previous reporting limits of $20,000 and 200 transactions.

What’s going away?

While the “big, beautiful bill” is almost entirely focused on cutting taxes, some tax credits are going away — primarily in the realm of clean energy.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing a new electric vehicle and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing used EVs, will both end on Sept. 30, 2025.

Two clean energy tax credits, which together allow homeowners to claim a tax credit for rooftop solar, geothermal heat pumps or other green energy devices, will end after 2025.

A lot of changes — with a smaller IRS

Many new tax changes will require the IRS to develop new internal rules and guidelines — at a time when the agency is rapidly losing staff and funding. As part of the new administration’s push to trim the federal workforce, the IRS workforce has already decreased by more than 25% and further cuts are planned.

Now it’s prepared to usher in a second one, when the country’s leaders in innovation, technology, energy and artificial intelligence meet at Carnegie Mellon University on Tuesday for the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit.
Drake’s Well, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, ushered in an energy revolution.
“People will quickly see we are on the brink of America’s next industrial revolution, just in the same way Pennsylvania led the first one when Drake’s oil was discovered,” McCormick said.
His answer: “The energy production is incredible, it is the number two energy producer in the country which is the first necessary step to power the AI revolution and to really power the energy revolution.","PITTSBURGH — It was the site of America’s first industrial revolution. Now it’s prepared to usher in a second one, when the country’s leaders in innovation, technology, energy and artificial intelligence meet at Carnegie Mellon University on Tuesday for the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit.

President Donald Trump, in an interview with me ahead of the summit, said the event is going to “open the eyes of a lot of people of what is about to be unleashed in Pennsylvania.”

Senator David McCormick, the Pittsburgh Republican who assembled the July 15 event, said the energy and AI summit will feature Trump, several cabinet members, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, big Tech leaders from OpenAI and Meta as well as energy leaders from all over the country, including the natural gas powerhouse EQT’s Toby Rice.

“And what is about to happen here in Pennsylvania, with the technology experts from our universities, the natural resources, the ability to turn around long dormant industrial communities and our unparrelled workforce is a game changer,” McCormick said.

He compares the moment to 1859, when Edwin Drake became the first American to successfully drill for oil. Drake’s Well, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, ushered in an energy revolution.

Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie was an early investor in this oil boom, which he then used to build the largest steel company in the world in western Pennsylvania. Carnegie became one of the richest men in American history, and donated most of it — including to the Pittsburgh research university that bears his name.

“People will quickly see we are on the brink of America’s next industrial revolution, just in the same way Pennsylvania led the first one when Drake’s oil was discovered,” McCormick said.

“We are at that moment right now, thanks to the technology that comes from [Carnegie Mellon] and the hubs of companies that surround it, as well as our incredible work force to build these AI data power centers, and the tradesmen and women who will supply the energy needed for them,” he said.

Darrin Kelly, the President of the Allegheny-Fayette Labor Council, said if the investments in projects all line up, his men and women will be ready to go. “We have the best workforce in the world and no matter what it is, we’ll shine when the time comes.”

The event comes on the heels of a boom in the labor force in Pennsylvania that kicked off last month when Trump announced the partnership and $11 billion investment from Japanese-owned Nippon Steel. That investment not only kept the American steelmaker in the U.S., but also protected more than 100,000 jobs through investments in steelmaking in Pennsylvania as well as in other plants in Indiana, Arkansas, Minnesota and Alabama.

That announcement was quickly followed by Amazon pledging $20 billion in Pennsylvania for AI infrastructure.

Shapiro told me that the investment will establish multiple high tech cloud computing and AI innovation campuses across the Commonwealth, “It will create thousands of new jobs that will build, operate and maintain the first two data center campuses in Luzerne and Bucks counties,” he said, adding, “look for more investment soon.”

Western Pennsylvania sits in the sweet spot for the growth and development of the AI boom; both the University of Pittsburgh and CMU are heralded for attracting and training some of the brightest minds in the country when it comes to engineering, research and artificial intelligence.

Western Pennsylvania has had its troubles. After the end of the steel boom, the area decayed, unemployment was rampant — still-vacant coal fired power plants, steel mills and manufacturing plants stand as ghostly sentinels of an era that has long vanished.

But things started to turn around about 15 years with a natural-gas boom and oil fracking technology. McCormick says between the access to massive amounts of energy, both natural gas, nuclear as well as coal that will turn things around in a way no one has seen for generations.

In April, in Homer City, the stacks of a former coal fired power plant were imploded, and the site is being redeveloped into a $10 billion AI and data center.

In the two years since the Homer City coal fire plant had been closed down, the tiny western Pennsylvania village had already started to show signs of depression — but the new investment changed everything.

McCormick said this isn’t just about the potential tens of thousands of construction jobs to build these AI data centers. “These jobs will also include chemists, scientists, engineers, AI experts, physicists,” he said.

McCormick said people have asked him why Pittsburgh?

His answer: “The energy production is incredible, it is the number two energy producer in the country which is the first necessary step to power the AI revolution and to really power the energy revolution. We have incredible skilled labor, with the welders, steam fitters, pipe fitters, construction workers and electricians, but we also have incredibly sophisticated technologists.”

“I think it’s arguably CMU is the best AI university in the country. It’s got incredible tradition with computer science and technologists, which is why in recent years, Google and Apple and Airbnb and everybody else, Tesla all have offices around here because they’re trying to draw on that talent,” he said.

Trump, Shapiro and McCormick all expressed great excitement about what people learn from this summit, but also to show the turn around for the region.

“Too often the stories have been about what once was, well this is a moment about how great things will be,” said McCormick, adding, “We are only beginning.”

The court first considers whether Melissa Hunley, the closest of the property owners, had standing in the circuit court. Her property is approximately two miles from the concrete batch plant. Given that the concrete batch plant in this case is not dissimilar from the construction sites at issue in other Supreme Court cases assessing standing to challenge zoning decisions, and given that Hundley is located significantly farther from the concrete batch plant than successful litigants in Supreme Court cases where the court has found that there was standing, the court finds that Melissa Hundley has failed to satisfy the first prong of the standing test.

Moreover Hundley has not shown that the construction and operations of the concrete batch plant create a “particularized harm” to her or to her property that is “different from that suffered by the public generally.” While Hundley alleges that runoff from the concrete batch plant could damage her streams, the record before this court on appeal shows that her property is actually upstream from the concrete batch plant, so the streams on her property would not be harmed by any purported runoff that runs into Mill Creek.

Furthermore, it is not enough for Hundley to claim that dust and noise from the concrete batch plant will affect her. Hundley must instead allege that the dust and noise affect her in a way distinguishable from those around her—the general public—and that the concrete batch plant creates “sufficient noise, particulate matter, or pollution off site to cause actual harm.”

Remaining property owners

The remaining property owners each alleged in their petition that the dust, noise or runoff from the concrete batch plant would negatively impact their enjoyment of the natural resources on their own land and in the surrounding area. These property owners, however, have not alleged why the special environmental protections included in the modified permit that Rocky Forge Wind obtained from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality would not protect them from the alleged dust, noise and runoff from the concrete batch plant.

In addition, the property owners have not sufficiently alleged the expected impact of the concrete batch plant on their own properties. Instead, they have merely relied on news reports and other information describing the consequences of other concrete batch plants elsewhere.

The additional concerns alleged by the property owners that a potential “spill of concrete, fuel, cement, etc., could be devastating” to “the property owners abutting Mill Creek” likewise fails to satisfy the particularized harm standard for standing because none of the property owners (other than Hundley who, as noted lives upstream from the concrete batch plant) claim to own land actually abutting Mill Creek or the Rocky Forge Wind Farm site.

This committee makes recommendations for council consideration. Majority council approval would be required at a future council meeting for any resolutions to take effect.

The first resolution focuses on the proposed construction of a plastics plant by Alterra Energy LLC in Sugarloaf Township.

According to the proposed resolution, the Akron, Ohio-based company has proposed to construct a plastics pyrolysis plant at 42 Tomhicken Road that would involve transporting approximately 100,000 tons of discarded plastic into the county from major urban centers, such as New York City and Philadelphia.

It said the “proposed plant would reportedly produce approximately 80,000 tons per year of a fuel product derived from the pyrolysis of plastic waste.”

The resolution cites concerns about the emission of toxic chemicals and pollutants and would urge the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and any other relevant regulatory agencies to deny permits or other approvals for the proposed facility.

The second resolution would oppose new PPL transmission lines through Nescopeck, Black Creek, Sugarloaf and Hazle townships. PPL said that project will provide additional power and support existing and future load growth.

“Numerous residents, property owners and community organizations have expressed deep concerns regarding potential negative impacts on property values, community aesthetics, the environment and public health,” the proposed resolution said.

The resolution would urge PPL and regulatory agencies to pursue alternative routes or solutions and perform environmental and health impact assessments.

Tuesday’s committee meeting is at 6 p.m. in the county courthouse on River Street in Wilkes-Barre.

Instructions to attend remotely will be posted under council’s online meetings section at luzernecounty.org.

Councilman Jimmy Sabatino chairs the infrastructure committee, and Harry Haas is vice chair. The other members are Patty Krushnowski and LeeAnn McDermott.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, accused Republicans on Friday of wanting to ""bury their constituents"" after the deadly Texas floods by rolling back ways to combat climate change.

She specifically called out the Trump administration and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem for what she claimed was a delayed response to the flash flooding that devastated parts of central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend.

She went on to blame the Republican Party for voting on the ""big, ugly bill"" to effectively begin ""clawing back"" on ways to help combat climate change and prevent similar disasters.

""The reality is that we are going to continue to face emergencies, especially since as we just got done with the big, ugly bill, they are clawing back those things that would have hopefully started to cool this planet down, because they don’t believe in science,"" Crockett said on MSNBC’s ""The Weeknight."" ""The least that they could do is believe in helping American people. Unfortunately, we continue to see Republicans decide that they want to bury their constituents instead of actually doing everything that they can to make sure that they live amazing and full lives.""

More than 120 people were killed in the flash flooding with dozens reported missing.

Since last week, several Democratic figures have been quick to politicize the floods by blaming climate change and President Donald Trump’s government cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) for exacerbating the damage.

In a statement to Fox News Digital last week, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it ""shameful and disgusting"" to see Democrats politicizing the tragedy and insisted accusations that the NWS was understaffed had been ""debunked by meteorologists, experts, and other public reporting.""

US motorists who fancy switching from their old gas-powered vehicle to a new electric vehicle can claim up to $7,500 thanks to the Clean Vehicle Credits.

Anyone buying a used EV could save up to $4,000.

However, all of that is set to change after September 30.

$7,500 tax credit set to run out soon

While EVs are generally cheaper to run than their gas-powered counterparts, they tend to come with a higher upfront cost.

In the US, in a bid to get more folks to make the switch, the United States introduced an attractive tax credit of $7,500 for new US-made electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs.

However, the tax credit is set to be scrapped after the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill by President Donald Trump.

All federal EV tax incentives will end after September 30, 2025.

The bill was passed by Congress on July 3, and means all federal tax incentives will end on September 30.

As a result, car experts are sending out a clear message to US motorists who are considering getting an electric vehicle.

“Now is the time to buy,” director of industry insights at Cox Automotive Stephanie Valdez Streaty told CNBC.

She also suggested that we might see dealers offering better savings to create a sense of urgency with the $7,500 tax credit set to run out.

Things to watch out for if you’re buying a new EV

With the $7,500 tax credit set to run out in just three months, some experts have predicted a surge in new EV purchases.

But there are some things to look out for, the tax credit only applies to new vehicles, trucks, vans, and SUVs priced under $80,000 for trucks, and under $55,000 for all other cars.

If you’re hoping to get a used car to claim up to $4,000 in tax credit, it will need to be at least two years old and cost $25,000 or under.

The vehicle itself also needs to meet some requirements, including having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and undergoing final assembly in North America.

Greylock has grown the company by expanding in multiple directions: acquisitions, the drill bit and diversification.
We’ve increased production without drilling any new wells—just being able to get a lot of wells back online and working over wells.
“We’re starting to see a lot of traction and get deals done with what we call ‘demand-driven’ projects.
“That’s really unchanged.” Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said.","You need to be scrappy to survive as a private producer on the small side of the spectrum. But if you can keep that grit, hold the line on cost and set a sharp eye on the competition, you can spot the opportunities.

“That’s the fun part, but it’s certainly a challenge,” Greylock Energy CEO Kyle Mork told Hart Energy.

Greylock has grown the company by expanding in multiple directions: acquisitions, the drill bit and diversification.

Much of its leadership team worked together originally at Energy Corp. of America. In 2017, the Greylock team coalesced with backing from Boston-based private equity firm Arclight Capital and some 3,500 conventional wells in Appalachia, which the company still operates.

The next step was taking a position in Greene County, Pennsylvania, with unconventional acreage in the dry gas Marcellus play, and also some midstream assets.

“In the first several years of Greylock, we were really about growing via the drill bit in the Marcellus position in Greene County,” Mork said.

“The entire time we’ve existed, we’ve looked at opportunities to acquire new assets. Initially, we were primarily focused on other Appalachian assets and then as time went on, we started looking at other basins. In 2022, we closed a big deal to buy assets in the Rockies in both Utah and Wyoming from a public producer.”

That deal allowed Greylock “to really take an asset that was very non-core for the seller and [create] very much a core asset for us. We’ve increased production without drilling any new wells—just being able to get a lot of wells back online and working over wells.

“We’ve continued to develop, drill new wells and bring wells online in the east and are preparing for our first new activity in the Rockies in the next 12 months or so.”

Standing out

On a production basis, Greylock’s footprint is two-thirds in Appalachia and one-third in the Rockies. But two key aspects set it apart, Mork said.

Augmenting its upstream production is Greylock’s midstream business, which builds out projects for third parties.

“We’re starting to see a lot of traction and get deals done with what we call ‘demand-driven’ projects. For instance, we have two projects with a big steel producer here in Appalachia that consumes a good amount of gas as a part of the process, so we built pipelines for them. And we’re talking to data centers, like everyone else on Earth, and other big consumers of gas on the midstream side,” Mork said.

Next is the technical team in place that packs a one-two punch of expertise: the firm can develop, drill, complete and bring online new unconventional resources in multiple places, as well as workover conventional assets and optimize them.

“We’re comfortable with both operating and producing fairly complex producing assets and also doing the latest and greatest unconventional development,” he said.

Expanding development

Greylock is always looking for its next add-on, Mork said. In any given year, the firm is examining different packages and bidding on assets.

“As we think about the next 12 to 24 months, I think we will be looking to expand development in our Utica play, potentially a little more in the Marcellus and then definitely, get our first development activity going in the Rockies, but we will also be looking for outside opportunities.

“We’re pretty basin agnostic. We want to look at everything that comes to market in Appalachia and in the Western Rockies as well, but we’re open to other basins and we’ve looked at assets in a lot of other basins as well.”

The firm’s entrance into the Rockies wasn’t necessarily premeditated, he said.

“We just really liked the asset as we started to look at it and thought there were some unique things about being in that basin with their gas pricing, and we picked up some liquids with it.

“But yes, we will definitely be looking at potential acquisitions this year.”

Rocking the resource

Greylock is a gas-weighted producer, a position that is coming into its own this year as Henry Hub prices have shown stability while crude oil is rocked by market volatility, tariffs and trade turmoil. A drop in Henry Hub prices below $3/MMBtu—or a pop above $5, for that matter—might trigger a reconsideration of activity levels. As such, the firm hasn’t needed to revisit its guidance, a step many of its peers took during the first quarter.

“Our real focus in the second half of the year is our next batch of wells in our Utica position in northern Pennsylvania,” Mork said. “That’s really unchanged.”

Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said. But drilling deep, 10,000-plus ft laterals in the Utica is an expensive proposition that also promises significant volume. Year-over-year production growth by the end of 2025 could be as much as 15%, he said. Production growth is in a 10% to 15% year-over-year range.

“For us, turning in three, four, five wells a year, we can achieve steady growth with respect to new wells and total company production,” he said. “Like a lot of producers now, we’re not looking to grow dramatically and outspend cash flow to do so. We’re really looking to grow at a steady pace and be able to do it within our existing cashflow.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/07/drilling-site-2.jpg?itok=SpmD7yAS,N,,2025-07-13 21:04:08.911721

“The entire time we’ve existed, we’ve looked at opportunities to acquire new assets. Initially, we were primarily focused on other Appalachian assets and then as time went on, we started looking at other basins. In 2022, we closed a big deal to buy assets in the Rockies in both Utah and Wyoming from a public producer.”

That deal allowed Greylock “to really take an asset that was very non-core for the seller and [create] very much a core asset for us. We’ve increased production without drilling any new wells—just being able to get a lot of wells back online and working over wells.

“We’ve continued to develop, drill new wells and bring wells online in the east and are preparing for our first new activity in the Rockies in the next 12 months or so.”

Standing out

On a production basis, Greylock’s footprint is two-thirds in Appalachia and one-third in the Rockies. But two key aspects set it apart, Mork said.

Augmenting its upstream production is Greylock’s midstream business, which builds out projects for third parties.

“We’re starting to see a lot of traction and get deals done with what we call ‘demand-driven’ projects. For instance, we have two projects with a big steel producer here in Appalachia that consumes a good amount of gas as a part of the process, so we built pipelines for them. And we’re talking to data centers, like everyone else on Earth, and other big consumers of gas on the midstream side,” Mork said.

Next is the technical team in place that packs a one-two punch of expertise: the firm can develop, drill, complete and bring online new unconventional resources in multiple places, as well as workover conventional assets and optimize them.

“We’re comfortable with both operating and producing fairly complex producing assets and also doing the latest and greatest unconventional development,” he said.

Expanding development

Greylock is always looking for its next add-on, Mork said. In any given year, the firm is examining different packages and bidding on assets.

“As we think about the next 12 to 24 months, I think we will be looking to expand development in our Utica play, potentially a little more in the Marcellus and then definitely, get our first development activity going in the Rockies, but we will also be looking for outside opportunities.

“We’re pretty basin agnostic. We want to look at everything that comes to market in Appalachia and in the Western Rockies as well, but we’re open to other basins and we’ve looked at assets in a lot of other basins as well.”

The firm’s entrance into the Rockies wasn’t necessarily premeditated, he said.

“We just really liked the asset as we started to look at it and thought there were some unique things about being in that basin with their gas pricing, and we picked up some liquids with it.

“But yes, we will definitely be looking at potential acquisitions this year.”

Rocking the resource

Greylock is a gas-weighted producer, a position that is coming into its own this year as Henry Hub prices have shown stability while crude oil is rocked by market volatility, tariffs and trade turmoil. A drop in Henry Hub prices below $3/MMBtu—or a pop above $5, for that matter—might trigger a reconsideration of activity levels. As such, the firm hasn’t needed to revisit its guidance, a step many of its peers took during the first quarter.

“Our real focus in the second half of the year is our next batch of wells in our Utica position in northern Pennsylvania,” Mork said. “That’s really unchanged.”

Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said. But drilling deep, 10,000-plus ft laterals in the Utica is an expensive proposition that also promises significant volume. Year-over-year production growth by the end of 2025 could be as much as 15%, he said. Production growth is in a 10% to 15% year-over-year range.

“For us, turning in three, four, five wells a year, we can achieve steady growth with respect to new wells and total company production,” he said. “Like a lot of producers now, we’re not looking to grow dramatically and outspend cash flow to do so. We’re really looking to grow at a steady pace and be able to do it within our existing cashflow.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/07/drilling-site-2.jpg?itok=SpmD7yAS,N,,2025-07-14 05:10:43.835168

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 20:09:54.123788

Since the oil crises of the 1970s, many more countries have installed policies and emergency response measures that can buffer the impacts of potential supply disruptions, while also taking steps to diversify their energy mixes and improve energy efficiency. At the same time, the world’s energy system has grown increasingly complex and interconnected – calling for an expanded set of policy tools and updated approach to emergency preparedness, as discussed at the Summit on the Future of Energy Security in April 2025.

The IEA’s Global Energy Policies Hub, first released in October 2024 and reviewed annually by IEA Members, provides a snapshot of the current state of energy policies around the world. Its latest update, published this week, features over 5 000 records for over 84 countries that collectively represent about 90% of global energy demand. This presents an opportunity to explore how the world has progressed since the IEA was founded in 1974, and to assess whether it is in a better place to withstand shocks to energy supply chains. It also allows for an assessment of the new policies countries are adopting to manage emerging risks – from cyber threats to climate resilience and the security of clean energy supply chains.

Virtually all oil importers are now buffered by oil security measures advocated by the IEA

Over the past 50 years, significant strides have been made in implementing key emergency response measures to respond to oil supply disruptions. Prior to the first oil crisis in 1973, only a small number of countries – representing fewer than 1% of net oil imports – had emergency measures in place (such as Morocco’s 1971 Law on Security Stocks). The International Energy Programme, the IEA’s founding document, introduced a binding requirement in 1974 for Member countries to maintain oil reserves equivalent to 90 days of net imports, alongside measures to restrain demand and promote greater energy efficiency, diversification and innovation. As a result, by 1975, the coverage of emergency reserves and demand-restraint policies expanded to about 10 countries representing about 35% of global net imports.

Additional policies were implemented in response to the oil market shocks prompted by the Gulf War in 1991, the Libyan Civil War in 2011, and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Since 1991, 40 additional countries have adopted oil stockholding requirements and measures to help restrain demand in case of an emergency. Now, countries with at least one or more oil security measure cover 98% of net oil imports, with emergency oil stock requirements present in 61 countries (42 of which are net importers).

Natural gas security measures have proliferated over the past decade

Historically, natural gas security measures have been less common. However, the past 10 years have prompted a strong uptick in adoption – specifically in terms of stockholding requirements, which grew from covering only 11% of net gas imports in 2015 to 32% in 2025. Thirteen countries enacted or enhanced stockholding policies following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Notably, the European Union (EU) implemented gas stockpiling requirements – which set obligations for member states to fill storage facilities to at least 90% of their capacity by November each year – and Japan established a Strategic Buffer LNG (SBL) framework, with LNG cargoes readily available in case of supply emergencies. However, gas stockpiling remains limited outside of IEA Member countries; only Chinese Taipei, Thailand, South Africa and Ukraine have mandates for strategic gas stocks. This leaves around 98% of natural gas demand in emerging and developing economies uncovered by stockpiling requirements.

Demand-restraint measures for gas have become increasingly common since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well. Over 40 countries that are net importers of gas now have legislation in place to implement such measures, with 25 introducing them within the past 10 years, including most EU and Balkan countries. These measures again remain limited in emerging and developing economies, with only 12 countries – including Bangladesh, India and Pakistan – incorporating explicit demand-side measures into legislation.

Efforts to diversify energy supplies and improve efficiency have become fixtures in energy security policy

Beyond emergency measures, governments have also pursued longer-term policy efforts since the 1970s to reduce their exposure to disruptions in energy supply, largely via measures to improve energy efficiency and diversify their energy mixes.

Based on the IEA’s tracking, energy efficiency policies are now in place in about 130 countries. The coverage and stringency of these policies continues to expand; more than 15% of global energy demand has been covered by new or upgraded energy efficiency regulations or incentives in the past four years. Recent policies include the 2024 EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, Australia’s first-ever federal fuel economy standard, updated carbon dioxide (CO2) standards in Mexico and stronger fuel efficiency standards in Saudi Arabia.

As a result of this expanding coverage and increased stringency, the energy efficiency of key equipment, vehicles and appliances sold has improved in all regions since 2010. Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for appliances are getting tougher globally, the IEA Efficiency Policy Level Index shows. Meanwhile, stricter fuel economy standards have contributed to a more than 20% reduction in the road transport sector’s energy intensity, complementing trends such as increasing electrification and the substitution of other fuels for oil.

Policies aimed at diversifying countries’ energy mixes have also been implemented at an accelerated rate over the past two decades, especially in the power sector. Today, more than three-quarters of global power sector demand is covered by policies aimed at diversifying power generation, relying on measures such as utility obligations, tax credits and other incentives.

In recent years, the largest focus has been placed on renewables and nuclear. Since 2010, around 20 new countries have adopted new policies aimed at expanding renewable energy capacity, bringing the total to over 100 countries as of last year.

These efforts have had an impact. According to the IEA’s Total Energy Supply Diversification Index, in 1973, nearly 70% of today’s 32 IEA Members had what is considered high fuel concentrations in their energy mixes. Today, none remain in this category, following an increase in the shares of natural gas, nuclear power and renewable energy sources to meet their energy needs.

The focus of energy security policies is now expanding to cover critical minerals, cybersecurity and climate resilience

As the global energy system evolves, the definition of energy security is expanding, with governments increasingly considering measures to address risks related to critical minerals, cybersecurity and climate hazards. Policies and measures focused on energy supply chain risks remain less mature, but new frameworks are being adopted in a growing number of countries.

The IEA’s Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2025 highlighted the pivotal role that policy mechanisms can play in diversifying mineral supplies. While public financing support can help bring forward new projects, additional policy tools are needed to reduce investment barriers and provide long-term market signals. In light of the growing number of trade restrictions on critical minerals, strengthening resilience to potential supply disruptions is increasingly important as well.

Though efforts such as the IEA’s Voluntary Critical Minerals Security Programme, the Agency is working with governments to enhance preparedness, promote supply diversification, and foster innovation and recycling. The Critical Minerals Policy Tracker monitors and analyses policy developments on critical minerals across more than 35 countries. With an initial dataset of 200 policies, it now identifies more than 600.

Another recent IEA report, Energy Technology Perspectives 2024, highlights how countries are increasingly pursuing industrial strategies aimed at reducing supply chain risks for clean energy technologies and boosting domestic manufacturing. The EU Net-Zero Industry Act and Japan GX Promotion Strategy, for example, are set to alter the outlook for the manufacturing and trade of key energy products such as electric vehicles and batteries. Still, IEA analysis shows that further efforts are needed globally to ensure the diversification of supply chains for key energy components so they are less vulnerable to shocks.

The cybersecurity of energy infrastructure has also been receiving greater attention in the wake of several notable attacks.

Cybersecurity requirements for energy infrastructure are now in place in 71 countries. However, the frequency and complexity of attacks continues to increase; the IEA special report Energy and AI found that in 2024, a typical energy utility was subject to over 1 500 attempted cyberattacks per week – triple the number only four years earlier. The pace at which cybersecurity attacks grow and evolve will require the constant adaptation of policy frameworks to best respond to new threats – along with the use of technological innovations, such as proactive AI-enabled cybersecurity systems, which could enable quick interventions and responses to attacks.

Natural disasters continue to be among the most routine disruptions to energy systems – and risks to the secure operation of energy infrastructure are becoming more acute as a result of climate change and the increasing complexity of energy systems themselves.

To address these challenges and reduce the fallout from major weather events, natural disaster funds – which insure households and some small and medium enterprises in the case of major capital losses – are now in place in 55 countries.

During the Future of Energy Security Summit, countries asked the IEA to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of natural hazards on the energy system today and how they might evolve going forward, while identifying the policies and measures that could help address these risks.

The results will be published in a forthcoming report, and future versions of the Global Energy Policies Hub will include an expanded assessment of policies in this category.",,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:27.077860

The Trump administration is defying these principles. President Trump is rolling back longstanding protections using unlawful shortcuts that shortchange the public’s right to provide input and understand how that feedback has shaped federal agency decisions.

Enacted soon after the end of World War II, the Administrative Procedure Act outlines steps that federal agencies must take when they issue or amend regulations, also known as rules. Critically, this process includes soliciting and then responding to significant comments from the public, especially when those rules affect people’s rights and responsibilities under federal law.

The Trump administration has jettisoned this established approach to rescind bedrock legal protections for everyday Americans in the dark of night, with almost no explanation.

President Trump signaled his plan to skirt established processes for rulemaking in a presidential memorandum issued on April 9, “Directing the Repeal of Unlawful Regulations.”

The memorandum accurately recognizes that a federal agency may use an expedited approach under the Administrative Procedure Act if it has “good cause” to find that the usual process would be “impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.”

Indeed, the Administrative Conference of the United States has recognized that expedited processes, such as direct final rules, are appropriate in some instances, such as when the proposed rule changes are noncontroversial. It further underscores the importance of public engagement whenever there is truly “good cause” to use an expedited approach.

However, the Trump administration is abusing this process by using expedited processes for changes that are clearly controversial.

For example, in May, the U.S. Department of Energy issued four direct final rules related to nondiscrimination protections in federally assisted programs or activities pertaining to general programs, new construction requirements, nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education and regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in sports.

This means that entities that receive federal funds from the Department of Energy will not have to provide interpretation and translation services when needed. They will not need to eliminate architectural barriers that make buildings inaccessible, nor will they be prohibited from engaging in activities that perpetuate the effects of discrimination.

These direct final rules are part of a broader rollback of longstanding civil rights protections under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws, which Trump previewed in his misguided and deceptively titled executive order on Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy.

The Department of Energy’s direct final rules on nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs or activities fail the laugh test under the Administrative Procedure Act. As a comment recently filed with the Department of Energy by more than 40 law professors explains, “The use of direct final rules in these contexts contravenes the clear language of the Administrative Procedure Act, ignores long-established procedures on notice and comment rulemaking, and undermines the role of public participation in government rulemaking.”

Reinforcing this point, another comment filed by nearly 30 civil rights, environmental justice and environmental organizations, together with supporting individuals, underscores how the administration’s approach “violates the procedural mandates of the Administrative Procedure Act and subverts nondiscrimination principles that benefit all Americans.”

In the end, the number of comments the Department of Energy received on its nondiscrimination direct final rules speaks volumes: 19,421 comments regarding nondiscrimination (general provisions), 20,711 comments regarding new construction requirements related to nondiscrimination, 9,293 comments regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education and 21,264 comments regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in sports.

So what’s the harm in allowing the Department of Energy and other federal agencies in the Trump administration to bypass established procedures? The harm is to all of us — the American public.

According to the Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act from 1947, the law seeks to ensure that federal agencies keep the public informed and engage them in rulemaking through uniform processes that are subject to judicial review. These goals remain as true today as they did nearly 80 years ago.

As the United States commemorates the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, we must remember our founding principles — that a government by the people and of the people must also be accountable to the people. We cannot let the Trump administration shortchange these goals.

This will make it virtually impossible for manufacturers in the US to compete with China in high-tech manufacturing.
The rejection of renewable energy and turning back to coal is pure ideology, a macho rejection of environmentalism and wokeism.
So, it's entirely appropriate that Anthony Albanese is meeting Xi again before he meets Trump for the first time.","A few days after Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill that ended most subsidies for renewable energy, among many other things, the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company, Nvidia Corporation, became the first to pass $US4 trillion ($6.08 trillion) in value.

And a few days after that, on Thursday, Bitcoin hit a new record high above $US117,000.

The data centres that operate both AI and cryptocurrency are already massively increasing electricity demand and investors are obviously expecting them to keep doing so — exponentially.

Meanwhile, the BRICS summit in Brazil last week — it stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa — went in the opposite direction to the United States on climate change, committing to ""intensify global efforts to contain global warming"".

China's renewable energy strategy is paying off

Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't make it to Brazil, but he chaired a meeting of China's Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs which issued a directive to crack down on overcapacity and ""disorderly competition"" in solar power.

Let's join the dots: America is pivoting back to fossil fuels and pulling out of renewable energy while the rest of the world continues to do the opposite, China is grappling with too much renewable energy while investors are bidding expectations to record highs for the new industries whose data centres are eating the world's electricity.

In his Independence Day address after signing the One Big Beautiful Bill, Trump said: ""I noticed something — with all the windmills that China sends us, where we waste our money because it's the most expensive energy, you know they make about 95 per cent of them, the wind turbines, I have never seen a wind farm in China! Why is that?""

That is a long way from being true: China is bristling with wind farms, and solar farms.

Mistake number two for Trump is the cost: wind and solar are now the cheapest form of energy in China, as well as in most other places, and onshore wind is by far the cheapest, less than half the cost of coal.

China's long-term strategy of dominating the manufacture of renewable energy and electric vehicles, as well as critical minerals, especially the rare earths needed in modern technology, is now paying off, big time.

'Real men burn stuff'

Meanwhile, in the US, Trump announced a 50 per cent tariff on imports of copper, which is one of the minerals needed for AI and renewable energy.

This will make it virtually impossible for manufacturers in the US to compete with China in high-tech manufacturing.

That was on top of letters Trump sent to dozens of national leaders last week telling them what the tariff is going to be on their exports to America.

Why would America embark on such a series of colossal, and obvious, acts of self-harm?

The rejection of renewable energy and turning back to coal is pure ideology, a macho rejection of environmentalism and wokeism. As Paul Krugman wrote the other day: ""Real men burn stuff and don't worry if the process is dirty.""

In his Independence Day speech, Trump declared: ""Coal is back. You can't use the word 'coal' unless you precede it by saying 'clean beautiful coal.'""

China is also building coal-fired power stations, but only because it has to; the idea of saying ""coal is back"" and calling it clean and beautiful at the same time as more than one hundred people were dying in a Texas flood is insane.

Trump's tariff lie

As for the tariffs, the world's economists and trade policy experts are mystified by America's trade wars, but I don't think that's what they are: tariffs are taxes that Trump can say are paid by foreign countries rather than by Americans.

The letters he sent last week all said: ""We will charge (insert country) a Tariff of only (insert number) on any and all … products sent into the United States.""

That's what he always says when he's talking about the tariffs — that he is ""charging"" that country, as if it's a kind of fee paid to the US government for the right to sell stuff to Americans, and that the US Treasury is making tons of money from them. It is, but not from the other countries.

He knows, of course, as does everyone else, that tariffs are a sales tax paid by the American buyers of the imported products or absorbed into the margins of the local companies importing them if they can't pass it on for some reason.

The US government is ""charging"" the Americans who buy Brazilian products a 50 per cent tax on what they buy, not Brazil, and will be putting a 50 per cent tax on copper, as well as taxes of at least 10 per cent on every import coming into the US.

It is a GST of at least 20 per cent on the $US4.1 trillion of goods imported into the US — 14 per cent of total goods sold.

Before the tariffs are fully in place, the US government is already making about $US30 billion in extra revenue and will theoretically increase to about $US500 billion.

Except that Trump keeps saying that American citizens aren't paying it — someone else is.

It is breathtaking, brilliant, political mendacity; the media, economists and his political opponents are getting tired of pointing it out, and he just keeps saying it, proving Joseph Goebbels's dictum that if you repeat a lie often enough it becomes true.

Xi now more important than Trump

The result of all this is that China — a ruthless autocracy — appears destined to take global leadership from the US, in trade, the means of producing energy and, possibly, in ""soft power"", or moral leadership, as the US withdraws from foreign aid and multilateralism.

The US dollar seems entrenched as the world's reserve currency and the basis of most finance and trade, but even that can't be taken for granted. It won't be replaced by Bitcoin, but a combination of the Euro and Chinese yuan is likely to eat into its market share.

But Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are not going away, and the data centre capacity they require will continue to add to the ballooning demand for computing power and electricity from AI.

And while the leader in AI chip design, and now the world's most valuable company — Nvidia — is American, its chips are made in Taiwan, just as Apple's iPhones are made in China.

The American technology companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon still reign supreme over the internet and AI era, but China is closing on them fast.

China is already in the process of obliterating the American and European car industries with solid, well-designed, cheaper vehicles and will almost certainly do the same with all other high-tech products, including robots.

So, it's entirely appropriate that Anthony Albanese is meeting Xi again before he meets Trump for the first time.

Xi is more important than Trump now.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/26703bf8ad4eb1c49c5a5df8a0499eb2?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2025&cropW=3600&xPos=0&yPos=188&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-07-13 20:09:32.981770

Investors should: Favor infrastructure plays: Charging networks and tech partners are foundational to the mandate's success.","The push to decarbonize transportation is no longer theoretical—it's regulatory reality. New York City's Green Rides Mandate, which requires all high-volume rideshare trips to use zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) or wheelchair-accessible vehicles by 2030, is a landmark policy with profound implications for ride-sharing giants like Uber and Lyft, EV infrastructure providers, and investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition.

The mandate's phased targets—starting at 5% ZEV compliance in 2024 and escalating by 10–20 percentage points annually—create a clear timeline for stakeholders. Yet the path to full electrification is fraught with financial, operational, and logistical challenges. For investors, this is both a cautionary tale and an opportunity to identify companies positioned to thrive—or falter—in this transition.

The Cost Burden on Drivers: A Critical Hurdle

While the mandate aims to “electrify without imposing new costs on drivers,” the reality is starkly different. Ride-sharing drivers—who often operate as independent contractors—bear the brunt of upfront EV costs, maintenance, and infrastructure gaps.

High EV Prices and Maintenance: Electric vehicles (EVs) cost $30,000–$130,000, far exceeding the price of comparable gas vehicles. Battery replacements, which can cost up to $10,000 after five years, add to the burden.

Lease Constraints: Many drivers are locked into long-term leases for gas vehicles, with no easy exit to switch to EVs.

Charging Inconveniences: With 80% of NYC drivers lacking home charging access, reliance on public stations is a necessity. Yet fast-charging infrastructure is sparse, and many existing chargers are Tesla-specific or slow Level 2 units.

These challenges could pressure Uber and Lyft to absorb costs or risk losing drivers—and market share—to competitors with better EV support.

Infrastructure Gaps: The Achilles' Heel of Electrification

Even if drivers could afford EVs, the charging network must expand exponentially. The city's goal to install 40,000 Level 2 and 6,000 fast chargers by 2030 is ambitious but faces hurdles:

Geographic Inequity: Manhattan dominates charger availability, while Queens and the Bronx lag behind.

Cost and Complexity: Curbside L2 chargers are unreliable for high-mileage fleets, and private investments (e.g., Revel's superhubs) are still nascent.

Policy Delays: The TLC's delayed release of its FHV License Review report and legal challenges (e.g., the NYC Taxi Workers Alliance's lawsuit) risk further delays.

Without swift progress, the 2030 deadline may be unrealistic, forcing the TLC to revise benchmarks—a risk for investors betting on strict compliance.

Policy Support: A Double-Edged Sword

Federal and state incentives aim to bridge the EV cost gap. Tax credits, rebates, and subsidies could push EVs to price parity with gas vehicles by 2027, but timing is critical. Meanwhile, New York's mandate to sell only ZEVs after 2035 reinforces the long-term shift.

However, policy support is uneven:

Subsidies vs. Realities: While drivers qualify for up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, many lack the liquidity to wait for refunds.

Penalties for Non-Compliance: While undefined in detail, fines for missing annual targets (e.g., $50 per 1,000 underperforming trips) could pressure companies to subsidize drivers or risk penalties.

Investment Plays: Winners and Losers in the Transition

Opportunities in EV Infrastructure

Charging Network Operators:

ChargePoint (CHPT): A leader in public and commercial EV charging, with partnerships across industries.

EVgo: Specializes in fast-charging networks, critical for rideshare drivers needing quick turnaround.

Revel (private): Expanding superhubs in NYC could position it for future listings or acquisitions.

Tech and Software Partners:

Blink Charging (BLNK): Provides hardware and software solutions for fleet electrification.

Smart-charging platforms: Companies like Volta or Electrify America offering grid management tools may gain traction.

Ride-Sharing Stocks: Proceed with Caution

Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT): Both face headwinds. While they've pledged to go all-electric by 2030, their ability to incentivize drivers (via bonuses, discounted leases, or infrastructure partnerships) will determine their competitiveness. Investors should monitor their EV fleet adoption rates and any regulatory fines.

Risk Factor: If infrastructure lags or penalties escalate, costs could squeeze margins.

Equity Plays in EV Manufacturing

Tesla (TSLA): Dominates the luxury EV market, but its lack of rideshare-specific models limits direct exposure.

NIO (NIO) or Rivian (RIVN): Potential for rideshare-focused vehicles, though both face execution risks.

Conclusion: Balance Risk and Reward

New York's Green Rides Mandate is a pivotal test case for urban electrification. Investors should:

Favor infrastructure plays: Charging networks and tech partners are foundational to the mandate's success.

Monitor Uber/Lyft's adaptability: Their ability to support drivers financially and politically will determine long-term viability.

Beware regulatory risks: Delays or penalties could disrupt timelines and investor sentiment.

The path to 2030 is bumpy, but for those positioned to navigate it, the rewards—including cleaner cities and a $200 billion global EV infrastructure market—could be transformative.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 19:07:47.533421

Energy Secretary Chris Wright is defending the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate wind and solar subsidies as part of a broader tax cut package, arguing that renewable energy sources actually make electricity more expensive rather than cheaper. Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive, contends that intermittent renewables create costly inefficiencies in the electrical grid system.

The Trump administration’s tax legislation will phase out green energy subsidies by 2026, saving an estimated $500 billion over ten years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

However, critics warn this will result in job losses, higher energy bills, and reduced grid capacity as renewable energy projects become less economically viable.

Mr. Wright challenges the conventional wisdom that renewable energy reduces costs, pointing to states like California as evidence. He notes that California, which has heavily invested in wind and solar while importing renewable power from neighboring states, has electricity prices twice as high as Florida, which focused on natural gas infrastructure instead.

The energy secretary argues that renewable sources require maintaining essentially two separate electrical grids — one for when renewable sources are producing power and another for backup when they’re not. This dual system forces traditional power plants to operate less efficiently, ramping up and down to accommodate intermittent renewable generation.

Opposition comes from Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the renewable tax credits and calls the cuts “an outright massacre.” Clean energy advocates warn that eliminating subsidies will force consumers to pay higher costs for unsubsidized renewable projects or drive utilities back to more expensive fossil fuels.

Mr. Wright specifically praised President Trump’s executive order blocking offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard, describing offshore wind as among the most expensive energy sources globally. He cited Connecticut as an example where offshore wind was projected to cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, almost double the cost of the state’s nuclear power plant.

The energy secretary believes the policy changes will encourage states to pivot toward more reliable baseload power sources like natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. He argues this shift will ultimately reduce energy costs by eliminating the inefficiencies created by intermittent renewable sources.

Critics counter that transitioning away from renewables toward natural gas would require years of permitting and construction for new plants, potentially leaving grids short of capacity and consumers facing higher prices during the transition period.

**STATE-BY-STATE FACT SHEET** Republicans Slash Vital Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Funding for States

WASHINGTON — House Appropriations Committee Republicans today released the draft fiscal year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies funding bill, which will be considered in subcommittee tomorrow. The bill raises costs for American households, undermines infrastructure investments, and weakens our national security.

For 2026, the Energy and Water bill provides $57.3 billion in discretionary funding. Within that amount, the bill provides $24.1 billion for nondefense programs, a cut of over $675 million, or 2.7 percent, below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level, and $33.2 billion for defense programs, a cut of $91 million, or 0.3 percent, below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

The legislation:

Increases energy costs, jeopardizes energy independence, and hurts United States’ competitiveness by slashing the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs nearly in half, revoking more than $5 billion from the Department of Energy’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources, and eliminating funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Weakens national security and leaves Americans more vulnerable to nuclear threats by cutting the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account by 17 percent.

Abandons commitments to communities to clean up radioactive waste by eliminating funding for the Corps of Engineers’ Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program and cutting the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management by 9 percent.

“House Republicans have once again produced a reckless and short-sighted proposal that betrays working families and undermines America’s future.

It also weakens vital nuclear nonproliferation programs that help keep our country and allies safe. By turning their backs on communities still suffering from the legacy of our early atomic weapons programs, Republicans show how little regard they have for America’s promises. We must invest in our energy independence in perpetuity — not abandon it. I strongly oppose this bill and will continue fighting for policies that uplift our communities and secure our energy future for all the generations to come.”

“Once again, instead of working to find ways to address the cost-of-living crisis, House Republicans introduced a bill that would make the problem worse,” Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT-03) said. “Middle class, working class, and vulnerable Americans continue to struggle to pay their bills, but House Republicans’ 2026 Energy and Water funding proposal slashes resources for programs that lower energy costs for families and businesses and eliminates resources that provide clean, affordable, secure energy to households. While President Trump continues to inflame tensions with our adversaries, House Republicans' bill would leave our country more vulnerable to nuclear threats and yield American leadership of the world’s energy future to China. With this bill, Republicans are failing to confront the climate crisis and putting tens of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs at risk. This legislation is an attack on the country’s energy future. Democrats are at the table and ready to pass legislation that actually lowers energy costs for the American people and ensures America leads the global transition to a clean energy economy.”

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 22:06:14.595732

“A couple of floors have already been leased to our partners from Europe who are coming over,” Darling said.
County Commissioners voted in early 2024 to begin negotiations with the company to purchase the 63-acre SunRail site for the Green Garden Village campus.
The expansion site for phase 2, south of the Falcon Trace II apartments, will initially be developed as a large pond for floodplain mitigation.
Darling said the stormwater pond in the northeast corner of the site will then be expanded in phase 2.","French green energy company CMG CleanTech is on track to break ground this November on its long-awaited $500 million Green Garden Village campus at the Poinciana SunRail Station site.

CEO John Darling told GrowthSpotter the first phase will include the first factory, a data center, and a 6-story office building that will serve as corporate headquarters for the company’s U.S. affiliate, Panacea Global Energy.

“A couple of floors have already been leased to our partners from Europe who are coming over,” Darling said. Panacea recently named Craig Miller as chief financial officer, and he’s currently assembling his executive staff. “We’re not bringing anybody from outside the United States. I want to build the whole thing as an American team.”

The 50,000-square-foot factory will be the first of seven manufacturing facilities planned for the campus, and the only one the first phase. It will produce solar-assisted heat pump water heaters. Darling said he believes there will still be a market for the company’s clean energy products despite the recent passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminates incentives and tax credits for solar panels and related products.

“It hasn’t altered our business strategy,” Darling said. “The reason why it hasn’t altered it is because people will always buy a product that can deliver them lower-cost energies. The issue within the market is there are products out, but they’re very expensive, and so the investment is too long.”

Darling said the company has already sold about 22,000 solar-assisted heat pumps in the U.S. “That product is a real jewel in the crown of the suite of products that we have in the business,” he said.

The 100,000-square-foot data center will be designed to be as carbon-neutral as possible. Darling said Duke Energy has signed on to build a 10-megawatt substation, and Panacea will install a solar film system on the roof, combined with hydrogen fuel cells and battery storage to reduce the energy demand by 25 megawatts.

“The data center will be run as green as we possibly can,” Darling said. The user will be a “national company” and global leader, he said, but he couldn’t reveal the name because he signed a non-disclosure agreement.

Darling said the Phase 1 buildings should be completed in 2027. The entire campus will be constructed using RENCO building blocks. The development team consists of Turner Construction, construction manager; Little Diversified, architecture; and KPM Franklin, civil engineers.

A 20,000-square-foot welcome center will be constructed just north of the SunRail station. The first floor will function as a product showroom, while the second floor will be an educational center for employee training. The first phase is expected to generate about 250 jobs.

The site plan, which was submitted to the county last week, also shows a pair of mixed-use buildings that will have a state-of-the-art wellness center and gym on the first floor and 80 residential units on the upper floors.

The final component of Phase 1 is a soccer pitch with men’s and women’s locker rooms and stadium seating for about 2,500. The company is recruiting coaches and trainers from Europe to help establish a full academy.

“It’s going to have a British pub-style restaurant in there, as well,” Darling said. “But we are going to be actively looking within the local community for different soccer clubs that want to get involved with us.”

CMG Clean Tech has been working with Osceola County since 2023, when it first submitted a bid to purchase county-owned property next to Valencia College’s Poinciana campus. The company later shifted its focus to the Poinciana SunRail property due to intense opposition because of its location close to residential neighborhoods and fears about the safety of the proposed hydrogen plant.

County Commissioners voted in early 2024 to begin negotiations with the company to purchase the 63-acre SunRail site for the Green Garden Village campus. County Manager Don Fisher told GrowthSpotter the company has met all of the benchmarks set in the memorandum of understanding.

“They’re on schedule, and they did meet that deadline,” Fisher said. “So I gave them a little bit more time to respond to some of the questions that we had. But they’re in a good spot right now.”

Darling said the design team has been working with FEMA, the South Florida Water Management District, and Osceola County for about 14 months to create a site plan that meets the environmental standards without having to reduce the scope of the project, which still aims to create 1,200 high-paying jobs. The solution was to split the project into two phases.

The expansion site for phase 2, south of the Falcon Trace II apartments, will initially be developed as a large pond for floodplain mitigation. Darling said the stormwater pond in the northeast corner of the site will then be expanded in phase 2.

“And then that will allow us then to use the area to the west for six more industrial buildings,” he said. Those factories will produce next-generation solar film products, solar panels, hydrogen fuel cells, lithium batteries and EV charging systems.",https://www.growthspotter.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2020/07/30/FN7LZ5LBQNCHTBKDBURYVXHXKM.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:32.818899
,American Energy,2025-07-13 21:04:26+00:00,techxplore.com,"Faced with US heat waves, the Navajo push for power—and A/C - Tech Xplore",Romain FONSEGRIVES,,,,,https://techxplore.com/news/2025-07-navajo-power-ac.html,"Workmen plant electricity poles in the rust-orange earth of the Navajo Nation and run cables to Christine Shorty's house—finally giving her power against the searing Arizona desert heat.
In her 70 years, Shorty has seen her isolated, tiny hamlet of Tonalea, a dot in the enormous area of the reservation, change dramatically.
Since 2019, electricity has been supplied to 5,000 families in the reservation, including 1,000 thanks to ""Light Up Navajo,"" Becenti said.
Without more funding, connecting the remaining 10,000 Navajo families without electricity could take another two decades, Becenti says.
""My mom and dad were in their 20s, they were promised power,"" but it never materialized, she says.","Workmen plant electricity poles in the rust-orange earth of the Navajo Nation and run cables to Christine Shorty's house—finally giving her power against the searing Arizona desert heat.

It will be a luxury in the vast Native American reservation, the largest in the United States, where more than 10,000 families are still without electricity and therefore air conditioning.

""It's climate change. It's getting hotter,"" Shorty tells AFP.

""This would be easier for us with the fan and maybe air conditioning. And we look forward to that.""

In her 70 years, Shorty has seen her isolated, tiny hamlet of Tonalea, a dot in the enormous area of the reservation, change dramatically.

Summer monsoon rains are rarer, and temperatures can touch 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) in July and August—previously unthinkable in the hamlet, located on a plateau at an altitude of 5,700 feet (1,730 meters).

The area's seasonal lakes are drying up, and in some years the livestock are dying of thirst.

Like many others, Shorty has a generator and small solar panels that allow her to power a gas fridge, cook and watch television.

But their power is limited, and she often has to choose which appliance to plug in.

Being hooked up to the electrical grid is ""a big change. It's going to make my life a lot easier,"" she tells AFP.

'Survival mode'

Most of the United States was electrified in the 1930s under President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal initiatives.

But in the Navajo Nation, which stretches across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the first efforts only began in the 1960s, and there are still not enough power lines.

""This area was looked over,"" says Deenise Becenti of the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA), the agency that manages the reservation's infrastructure.

""That surprises many people. They're saying, you know, why are there third world conditions that exist here in the United States, the greatest country in the world?""

To catch up, the semi-autonomous government of the reservation launched the ""Light Up Navajo"" project in 2019.

The humanitarian initiative sees electricity companies from all over the country send their employees to work in the reservation for around a dozen weeks a year.

Since 2019, electricity has been supplied to 5,000 families in the reservation, including 1,000 thanks to ""Light Up Navajo,"" Becenti said.

But as climate change drives temperatures higher, families still without power in the reservation—where many live below the poverty rate and unemployment is high—are in ""survival mode,"" she said.

'Angry'

Elbert Yazzie's mobile home turns into a furnace in the summer, and he has already lost one member of his extended family to heat stroke.

""I used to like the heat,"" the 54-year-old, who lives in nearby Tuba City, tells AFP.

""But when you get older I guess your body can't take it no more.""

His home was finally connected to electricity just weeks ago.

Since then, he has rigged up an evaporative air cooler, also known as a ""swamp cooler,"" by salvaging three broken appliances from a garbage dump.

""Now we can turn on the A/C anytime we want, so we don't have to worry about the heat, and the generator and the gas, and all that stuff,"" he says.

""Now we don't have to go to (other) people's houses to cool down, we can just stay home, relax, watch TV, things like that.""

He and Shorty are the fortunate ones.

Without more funding, connecting the remaining 10,000 Navajo families without electricity could take another two decades, Becenti says.

That is far too long for Gilberta Cortes, who no longer dares let her children play outside in the summer, for fear of getting heat-exacerbated nosebleeds.

An electricity pole has just been erected in front of the 42-year-old's house and a line is due to be extended to her in a few months' time.

But she has endured too much false hope to be serene.

""My mom and dad were in their 20s, they were promised power,"" but it never materialized, she says.

""I'm still angry.""

Michigan's current air quality The map below displays the current air quality at monitoring sites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
The shaded areas of the map show the approximate boundaries where air quality is available and listed as anything other than good.
Air Quality Index guidelines (ozone and particle pollution) Some people are more sensitive to air pollution because of their age or health.
People who are active or work outdoors are also at higher risk when the air quality is poor.","The entire state of Michigan is under an air quality alert now through all of Monday, July 14.

Elevated levels of fine particulate (PM2.5) due to residual wildfire smoke from Canada is causing the alert, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said on X.

The smoke will continue to move into Michigan on Sunday across the Upper Peninsula and the northern portion of the Lower Peninsula, the NWS says. It is expected to track east and south, expanding to the rest of Michigan as the day goes on and additional smoke is expected Monday.

""Pollutants across the state are expected to reach the Unhealthy (Red AQI) to USG (Orange AQI) range in northern locations, with ranges of USG to Moderate further south,"" NWS says.

Photos provided Sunday, July 13, by the Mackinac Bridge Authority show the Mighty Mac disappearing into the smoke from the wildfires.

The NWS recommends avoiding strenuous outdoor activities when possible, especially for people with heart disease and respiratory diseases like asthma.

Individuals should monitor for symptoms, including wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, dizziness or burning in the nose, throat or eyes.

It's recommended to reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning or use of residential wood burning devices. Avoiding activities that can lead to ozone formation like refueling vehicles or topping off when refueling, using gasoline powered lawn equipment and using charcoal lighter fluid is advised.

Although Michigan's ozone season generally runs between the warmer months of March and October, particle pollution from sources like power plants, vehicle emissions and industry can reach unhealthy levels year-round. Some of these pollutants are so small, PM2.5, they can be inhaled into your lungs and can even enter your bloodstream with serious health consequences. Other sources of particle pollution include unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfire smoke.

Michigan's current air quality

The map below displays the current air quality at monitoring sites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Air monitoring sites are color-coded based on the pollutant (ozone or particulate matter) with the highest value. Particles that are less than 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers in diameter are called PM10 and PM2.5, respectively.

An AQI of 50 or below means the current air quality is good. The shaded areas of the map show the approximate boundaries where air quality is available and listed as anything other than good. The information is updated hourly.

Air Quality Index guidelines (ozone and particle pollution)

Some people are more sensitive to air pollution because of their age or health. People who are active or work outdoors are also at higher risk when the air quality is poor. Health concerns related to poor air quality may include difficulty breathing, coughing or wheezing and more serious health effects such as lung damage, asthma attacks, heart attacks and stroke.

Here's how to interpret the Air Quality Index values, according to the U.S. EPA:

Good (0-50): The level of pollution in the air is of little to no risk.

Moderate (51-100): For people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution, a moderate health concern may exist.

Unhealthy for sensitive groups (101-150): People who are more sensitive to air pollution may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.

Unhealthy (151-200): Some people may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.

Very unhealthy (201-300): An alert is triggered; the general population is at risk for more serious health effects.

Hazardous (301-500): Emergency conditions health alert: Everyone is likely to be affected.

Economic and public health impacts are also affected by using coal such as increased healthcare costs due to respiratory illnesses and other health issues caused by air pollution. These health issues also result in lost productivity and higher healthcare expenditures. More jobs can be created by switching to renewable energy and will give communities like Estevan and Coronach, they say, real opportunities for the future.

The coalition says Saskatchewan must move forward with policies that ensure healthy communities, economic reconciliation, clean air, a stable climate, and sustainable jobs for generations to come.

The coalition is calling for:

-An immediate halt to the coal fleet rebuild

-Compliance with Canada’s 2030 coal phase-out mandate

-A just transition strategy for coal-dependent communities such as Estevan and Coronach

-Major public investment in renewables, storage, energy efficiency, and grid modernization

-Respect for Indigenous rights and clean energy partnerships with Indigenous communities and governments, particularly given the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate disasters on Indigenous and rural communities.

Guinness World Record Lucid Grand Longest EV Drive

Lucid Group has set a new GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS title after its Lucid Air Grand Touring drove 1,205 kilometers (approximately 749 miles) on a single charge, surpassing the previous record by 160 kilometers. The journey, from St. Moritz, Switzerland to Munich, Germany, showcased Lucid’s advanced electric powertrain and efficiency, reaffirming its leadership in EV range and performance.

Global Light-Duty Market Drive to Electrification

A new report from Guidehouse Research forecasts a major shift in the global light-duty vehicle (LDV) market, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) leading the transition. In 2024, BEVs are expected to account for 15% of global LDV sales, but that figure is projected to rise dramatically to 53% by 2033—representing a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Meanwhile, traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will see a steep decline from nearly 65% of sales in 2024 to just under 20% in 2033. The report highlights this shift as part of a broader global effort toward decarbonization and sustainable transportation.

Despite growing momentum, the transition to full electrification faces significant hurdles. Charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier in many regions, and some governments have slowed climate-related initiatives, prompting automakers to scale back earlier commitments. In addition, political and economic uncertainty—especially in the wake of the 2024 U.S. presidential election—has led to a more cautious investment environment. Still, Guidehouse analysts believe that the electrification trend is irreversible, as the combined forces of regulation, innovation, and consumer demand continue to drive growth.

The report, Light Duty Vehicle Electrification, outlines sales projections for various vehicle types, including BEVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), and ICEs. It analyzes how factors like government incentives and lower cost-per-mile will influence market dynamics through 2033. While the road to full electrification may include detours and delays, the report underscores that EVs are poised to dominate the LDV market in the years ahead.

Ford, Michigan Battery Plant “On Track” for Federal Tax Credits

Ford’s $3 billion battery plant in Marshall, Michigan—currently 60% complete—is expected to qualify for federal battery-cell production tax credits under the newly adjusted tax bill. The plant, set to begin production in 2026 and employ around 1,700 workers, had faced eligibility concerns due to its use of technology licensed from China’s CATL. An automakers’ group praised recent policy adjustments that preserve credits while excluding direct foreign ownership.

Panasonic Delays Kansas Battery Plant with Tesla

Panasonic is postponing the full-scale ramp-up of its Kansas EV battery plant, originally planned to reach 30 GWh capacity by March 2027. The delay is linked to cooling Tesla demand, as the plant was primarily built to serve Tesla’s needs. While initial production will continue, the timeline for reaching full capacity remains uncertain.

Automakers Push EV Sales Ahead of $7,500 Tax Credit Expiry

U.S. automakers are stepping up incentives, including offers like free home chargers, as the $7,500 federal EV tax credit is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2025. Industry analysts warn that EV registrations could drop as much as 27% without the credit, prompting companies to fast-track promotions and sales efforts in the coming months.

Tesla Stock Wobbles on Battery and Political Headwinds

Tesla’s stock remains under pressure amid delays in Panasonic’s Kansas battery facility and increasing political controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. Although the stock saw a mild rebound, it remains down 2% for the week and 23% for the year. Slowing EV demand, reduced incentives, and an aging product lineup are all contributing to investor uncertainty.

EV Charger Tax Credit Remains but Faces Earlier Expiration

The federal 30% tax credit for residential and commercial EV charger installations—up to $1,000—is still active, but will now expire on June 30, 2026, instead of running through 2032 as originally planned.

Note: Tariffs on solar panels from China are also impeding conversion to solar as China is a global leader in production of inexpensive solar panels.","If you’re a homeowner in Arizona thinking about going solar or buying an EV, you’ll need to get on the stick. Same thing for businesses and utilities.

While many of HR1’s cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance won’t kick in until after the 2026 midterm elections congress made sure the elimination of clean energy incentives is immediate.

HR1 rapidly ends federal tax credits that have helped ordinary homeowners (like us, when I installed rooftop solar two years ago) afford clean energy upgrades.

We Installed a Solar Power System at Our House: This is Our Story – AZ Public Health Association

That includes a soon to expire 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, which helped thousands of Arizonans install solar panels, batteries, and other home efficiency improvements.

That tax credit will be eliminated on December 31, 2025, with no phase-out and no grace period. To qualify for a tax credit systems must be fully installed & connected to the grid before the deadline New Years Day 2026 (not just contracted).

The timeline is even tighter for EVs. The $7,500 new EV tax credit and $4,000 used EV credit both expire on September 30, 2025.

And for businesses and utilities?

The bill strips away the long-term certainty they’d counted on as many businesses, community health centers (like Chiricahua), and utilities made plans to convert to a bigger renewable portfolio. To qualify for the Investment Tax Credit, business and utility projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be connected and in service by the end of 2027.

HR1’s elimination of tax incentives to invest in clean energy will slow down but not end the conversion to renewables as the ROI for clean energy projects is rapidly becoming the least expensive way to boost power generation even without the tax credits. In addition, new solar components in panels that source less and less expensive, improving the ROI.

Note: Tariffs on solar panels from China are also impeding conversion to solar as China is a global leader in production of inexpensive solar panels. Same goes for electric vehicles – which have a 100% tariff imposed on them.

If you’ve been thinking about solar or an EV the time to act is now. With the coming ‘gold rush’ of solar installation that’ll be created by the impending end of the credits, permitting delays, installer backlogs, and supply chain snags… you better get started NOW.

One group in the pro-pocketbook crowd, Climate Power, called Republicans’ bill a “National Rate Hike” in a memo last month.
Grounding conversations in how climate change affects pocketbooks — such as rising insurance premiums — also moves people.","Their targets would include the moderate Republicans who spent months urging Congress to preserve the Biden tax breaks because of their projected economic gains for GOP-held districts — only to fold and vote for Trump’s bill anyway. Trump is moving aggressively to enforce the law, ordering agencies to hasten the phase-out of green energy incentives despite a widespread consensus that the U.S. will need to ramp up electricity from all sources to meet the growing power demands of artificial intelligence.

“Democrats now have the high ground of price and Republicans are now the party of electricity shortages,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in an interview. “We’re just not going to have enough electrons to go around and the prices will go up — and that will be 100 percent because Republicans passed this ridiculous bill.”

Schatz added that Democrats don’t need to lead with their traditional message that clean energy is essential for dealing with climate change. “The people who care about climate are already with us,” he said.

Besides Schatz, Democratic climate leaders aligned on the new messaging include Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida. Eleven Democrats said in interviews that an emerging consensus in their party is cohering around a new campaign emphasizing pocketbook issues.

Some of the Democrats’ environmental allies are going all-in on the message. Clean Energy for America, an advocacy group, plans to plaster billboards with ads in seven swing districts attacking Republican House members who “just voted to raise your electricity bill.” Climate Power, a Democratic-aligned strategic communications operation, launched a six-figure national advertisement playing heavily on Fox News contending that the GOP’s policies renege on Trump’s promise to lower prices.

Republicans scoffed at the notion that Democrats will succeed in promoting themselves as energy price populists.

“It’s tough for the Democrats because they’ve made climate their energy priority for decades,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former aide to then-Sen. Marco Rubio who is a partner at Firehouse Strategies. “Voters associate liberals with prioritizing climate change over energy affordability.”

Also inconvenient for the Democrats is the fact that oil prices are hovering near four-year lows, GOP strategist Ford O’Connell said. So even if Democrats cling to a message that Republican policies raise energy prices, he said, those price hikes are unlikely to show up in the real world before the midterms.

“That’s just something that Democrats keep saying over and over, but it’s just not going to be true because the argument defies gravity,” O’Connell said.

Blaming Republicans for future energy price increases is “too abstract,” said David Victor, an expert on climate change and energy markets who works as a professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California San Diego. He added that for people who simply believe that green energy is expensive, the Democratic counterargument will be drowned out.

“People don’t believe it,” he said. “All kinds of claims are being made.”

Try, try again

The Democrats’ plans to seize on the energy argument is part of a larger effort to hammer Republicans over projections that the megabill will steer huge tax breaks to the wealthy while kicking millions of poorer Americans off Medicaid.

It also recognizes the new realities of the U.S. energy markets, including the rise of AI data centers and the fact that U.S. power consumption is moving up after almost 20 years of nearly flat demand.

Democrats believe the time is ripe to revive the call to speed the growth of wind and solar power — and bash the Republicans for taking the green power incentives off the table. They also contend that Trump’s law will spike power prices by making renewable electricity more expensive.

“We’re going to need to build assets for a growing grid. Choosing not to build things is fucking stupid,” Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois) said.

Castor agreed with the messaging approach, adding that her Tampa-area constituents are already well aware of how climate change is affecting their lives. But when she talks to them about what’s at stake in the Capitol and the White House, she said she focuses on “higher costs, higher electric bills.”

“Bread and butter, kitchen table issues — costs, their electric bills — are not going to see relief from Republicans,” said Castor, who chaired the now-defunct House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis when Democrats controlled the House from 2020 through 2022.

Of course, the jobs-and-prosperity message failed Democrats at the ballot box last year, possibly because the slow rollout of Biden’s $1 trillion-plus in energy, climate and infrastructure spending meant that many of its projected economic gains had not yet appeared. The Biden administration’s gargantuan spending initiatives also played little role in the campaign messaging by his would-be successor, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

One economic data point in the Democrats’ favor this time: Power bills have increased an average of 9 percent since January, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, giving Democrats a chance to try to tie any utility bill increases to the Republican law.

That upward pressure on prices is likely to accelerate, given that the U.S. doesn’t have enough power supply to meet a nearly 20-percent projected increase in demand during the next five years. And the new Republican budget law raises costs on wind and solar — even though those sources, combined with batteries, accounted for 93 percent of all new power added to the grid last year, according to the EIA.

Republicans have vowed to plug the gap with fossil fuels and nuclear energy. (Trump’s new law includes policies to boost production from those sources, for example by slashing royalties for fossil fuel production on federal land.) But orders for natural gas turbines face a years-long delay. New nuclear energy faces cost challenges and long lead times. And no utility has announced plans to build new coal-fired power plants, which still face an uncertain regulatory environment and stiff competition from other energy sources.

Economics over climate

Environmental and clean energy groups have largely swung behind the economic message.

One group in the pro-pocketbook crowd, Climate Power, called Republicans’ bill a “National Rate Hike” in a memo last month. It cited an analysis by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a trade group working with data center developers, that said repealing tax credits would raise household power bills $110 annually as early as next year.

But John Marshall, CEO of the Potential Energy Coalition, said the most persuasive way to get people to care about transitioning to clean energy and tackling planet-heating emissions is to talk about climate change more, not less.

On a matter that may be instructive for energy policy, voters prefer positions that encourage more options, not fewer, said Marshall, whose nonpartisan, nonprofit organization conducts research on climate communication. Grounding conversations in how climate change affects pocketbooks — such as rising insurance premiums — also moves people. But talk of future jobs at the national scale sounds too theoretical, he said.

“Climate is not a dirty word,” he said. “The smart play is to talk about the issue, but just talk about it in a slightly different way and make it relevant to different people’s lives.”

During last year’s campaign, supporters of the Democratic policies faced “a continual challenge” in trying to warn that Republican policies would kill future clean energy jobs and investments, said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups. But he said enough of those jobs have since materialized that it’s possible to hold GOP lawmakers accountable for businesses that close or construction projects that shut down.

“The new thing is we are moving from the abstract and the conceptual to, ‘This is what they did,’” Walsh said.

Democrats’ environmental allies also need to confront the lingering reputation of a “green premium” that leads many people to believe that wind and solar power are expensive, said Holly Burke, spokesperson for the green group Evergreen Action. In fact, wind and solar are cheaper per megawatt-hour than coal, and in many places they’re even competitive with natural gas, the United States’ dominant electricity source.

Those facts give Democrats a potential opening, Burke said.

“In October 2026 I’d be surprised if candidates are messaging on this specific bill, but what they will be messaging on is the impacts,” she said. “Your utility bill is your utility bill. Folks know Trump ran on lowering electricity costs and that Republicans are in charge.”",https://static.politico.com/ca/98/55a752c742cba72557a37fe4211c/u-s-congress-50654.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 16:08:56.734914

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.

So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.

But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.

“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.

Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.

The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.

Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.

The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

Two weeks ago, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.

“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:

“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.

But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.

Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.

“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.

On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.

Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.

But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.

He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.

The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.

“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”

A newly approved transmission line project will add thousands of megawatts (MW) to Minnesota’s energy grid, improving energy reliability and efficiency across the state.

In April, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved Xcel Energy’s Minnesota Energy Connection (MEC) transmission project. The project consists of a 174-mile, 345-kilovolt double-circuit high-voltage transmission line and related infrastructure. The MEC project will address the generation gap expected to occur when Xcel’s Sherburne County Generating Station (Sherco), a coal-fired power plant located in Becker, Minnesota, retires in 2030.

The MEC upgrade to the electric transmission system will cost-effectively deliver 2,000 MW of electricity to the Sherco Station and connect over 4,000 MW of renewable energy to the grid.

The MEC and similar projects represent vital improvements to Minnesota's aging transmission infrastructure. The Minnesota Department of Commerce’s 2023 Biennial Transmission Projects Report identified 164 current and anticipated transmission inadequacies — up from 103 in 2021.

Expanding and modernizing the grid is essential to ensuring Minnesotans can access electricity when they need it. Transmission improvements alleviate bottlenecks that have led to curtailment, a process in which energy systems are forced to temporarily halt operation due to a lack of capacity on the transmission lines.

Renewable energy projects provide a valuable source of tax revenue for rural communities, aiding in the funding of local schools, emergency services, infrastructure, and law enforcement. Projects also offer landowners a reliable source of income and create employment opportunities in rural areas. To fully capture these benefits, the state’s transmission grid must be updated to ensure it has capacity to support new, local renewable generation.

Once completed in 2028, the MEC transmission line will carry power from southwest Minnesota to the Sherco site, delivering enough electricity to serve more than 1 million homes across the Upper Midwest.

BEIJING (Reuters) -The world needs China to show more leadership on climate action, EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said on Sunday, highlighting the importance of cutting planet-heating emissions and reducing the Chinese economy’s reliance on coal.

Hoekstra is in Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials on environmental and climate issues at which he also wants to encourage China to stop building new coal-fired power plants and phase out use of the fossil fuel.

“We do encourage China to take more of a leadership role going forward and really hit the road with meaningful emission reductions in the next couple of years, and also move out of the domain of coal,” Hoekstra told Reuters in an interview.

The number of coal power plants in the pipeline has been increasing in China – the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, according to the World Economic Forum.

In the first three months this year, China’s approved 11.29 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants exceeded the approval rate in the first half of 2024, a June report by environmental group Greenpeace showed.

Last week, Hoekstra told the Financial Times the EU was holding off on signing a joint climate declaration with China unless Beijing pledges a greater commitment to reduce emissions.

“We are open to looking into a potential declaration, but … the thing that is most important about these types of statements is the content that goes into it,” he said when asked about the issue, without specifying what commitment the EU hopes to see from China.

Hoekstra said the EU is interested in seeking areas of cooperation with China ahead of the COP30 U.N. climate conference that will be held in Brazil in November.

His primary goal was to lock in tax cuts for big business and America’s wealthiest citizens.
This serves several purposes beyond paying for some of those tax cuts.
If left in place, the incentive payments and tax cuts were expected to cost $US656 billion and drive around $US2 trillion in private capital expenditure.
Loading Indeed, by the time the bill had been forced through Congress, it had gathered so many tax cuts and pay-offs that it failed to pay for itself.","Even by the standard of the Trump administration’s record on climate change and energy, the megabill passed by Congress on July 4 – the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill – is iridescently destructive. It will hurt Americans first, particularly those in Republican states. But eventually, we will all pay.

Trump’s goal with the BBB, as it has become known, was not, firstly, to assault the world’s climate. His primary goal was to lock in tax cuts for big business and America’s wealthiest citizens.

To placate the few remaining deficit hawks in Republican congressional ranks, the BBB’s authors had to make at least a pretence of seeking to pay for some of these cuts. They did so first by stripping funding that had been directed to the benefit of America’s poorest citizens.

For example, spending cuts to healthcare and food assistance programs in the bill will average about $US1.2 trillion over the next decade, while new tax cuts for households already making over $US500,000 each year will cost about the same, the Congressional Budget Office shows.

Because this transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich will not even touch the sides when it comes to paying for the BBB, Republicans also hacked into government spending on green technology.

This serves several purposes beyond paying for some of those tax cuts. It satisfies Trump donors in the fossil fuel industry, but more importantly, it undoes the signal achievement of the Biden administration – the Inflation Reduction Act.

The IRA served as both a post-COVID stimulus measure and as the world’s single largest ever investment in fighting climate change, a vast incentive scheme for new green tech in the US. If left in place, the incentive payments and tax cuts were expected to cost $US656 billion and drive around $US2 trillion in private capital expenditure.

Republican “red” states, set to benefit most from the IRA’s largesse, will now be worst hit while the BBB’s assault on the social safety net will disproportionately impact states which backed Trump.

But it will eventually hurt us all because the IRA, had it not been dismantled, would have spared the world around four billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Indeed, the total carbon cost of terminating the IRA, supercharging the US fossil fuel industry, and various other Trump executive actions, is now estimated to be around 7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Or, as the specialist climate publication CarbonBrief notes, around the total annual output of Indonesia, the world’s sixth-largest carbon emitter.

According to an analysis by Princeton University’s REPEAT project, US emissions are now set to fall by just 3 per cent by 2030, rather than the 40 per cent required should the US have reached its abandoned Paris Agreement target. This is around four per cent of current total global emissions each year.

This is the price we must all pay for Trump’s BBB, in both the incalculable increase in the impact and incidence of climate catastrophes over the coming years, and in the cost of offsetting those lost cuts by increasing the burden on other nations.

That Trump does not care about the global impact of domestic policies is no surprise. But what is harder to fathom is the costs he is willing to heap upon Americans.

Trump’s various climate and energy policies, including those in his BBB and the trashing of the IRA, plus his various executive orders, will see Americans paying more for dirtier sources of energy.

It will see a decrease in clean electricity generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours – more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to its electricity supply today. It will increase US household and business energy expenditure by US$28 billion annually by 2030 and over $US50 billion by 2035, according to REPEAT.

Average US household energy costs will increase by around $US165 per household per year in 2030.

Even more perversely, the initiatives will lock the US out of competition with China for a share of the technologies of the future beyond wind and solar. The burgeoning EV industry is being crippled not just by a loss of incentives and tax breaks for battery development, but by sanctions on the Chinese components the industry will need in the absence of US alternatives.

“We are in a global competition with China, and it’s not just EVs. And if we lose this, we do not have a future Ford,” Ford’s chief executive Jim Farley said at a conference last month, describing recent visits to China as the “most humbling experience” of his life.

Tellingly, even as Trump abandons the industries of the future with his BBB, he has propped up not just those of the fossil fuel era, but even one that came before. To secure the crucial support of the Alaskan senator Lisa Murkowski Trump found the cash to increase tax deductions for Alaskan subsistence whaling.

Indeed, by the time the bill had been forced through Congress, it had gathered so many tax cuts and pay-offs that it failed to pay for itself. Rather, over the next decade it will add US$2.5 trillion to the already eye-bleeding US debt of $US36.8 trillion.

Climate advocates have been locked in a debate over whether the only way to save the climate would be to destroy the global economy. Over recent years optimists had begun to toy with the notion that perhaps the revolution in green tech over recent years, such as the 90 per cent collapse in the cost of solar power, might just allow us to preserve both.

With his sprawling omnibus bill, a “showcase for fiscal incontinence and ideological exhaustion” in the words of The Economist, it is as though Trump has concluded that with enough effort, both could be destroyed at once.

While criticised by environmentalists, officials claim the recalibration is efficient and climate-conscious.

NEW DELHI: The mandatory retrofitting of coal-fired generation plants with mechanisms to reduce sulphur emission will apply to only units within 10 km of cities with population exceeding 10 lakh instead of all power stations under a 2015 mandate. The revised policy, notified on Saturday, is expected to reduce the cost of power by 25-30 paise per unit, officials and experts involved in the revision of the earlier mandate for installation of FGD (flue gas desulphurisation) units at all power plants said. The new norm lets off the hook 79% of the country’s thermal generation capacity, a fact that environmental activists have used to criticise the revision. But officials argued that the “evidence-based recalibration” makes the policy “focused, efficient and climate-conscious."" For example, they said, under the revised policy, new plants in critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis instead of an omnibus application that would push up the cost of power. The notification justified the revision, saying it is in line with the analysis by the Central Pollution Control Board, which found increased carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the operation of existing control measures. Additionally, studies by IIT-Delhi, CSIR-NEERI and the National Institute of Advanced Studies put ambient sulphur dioxide levels in most parts of the country within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Power producers have been opposing the blanket FGD mandate for all plants due to the high cost involved. Industry estimates put the cost of installing FGDs at all power plants at Rs 2.5 lakh crore, or Rs 1.2 crore per megawatt. This, industry representatives had said, would jack up tariff for consumers. Additionally, the average timeline of 45 days for each unit was also cited as a threat to grid stability during peak seasons. Differentiated compliance based on proximity to urban populations and the sulphur content of the coal used will ease the burden on power producers, industry executives said. Indian coal typically has a sulphur content of less than 0.5% and due to high stack heights and favourable meteorological conditions, dispersion of SO2 is efficient. Measurements across multiple cities showed sulphur oxide levels ranging between 3 and 20 micrograms per cubic meter, significantly below the NAAQS threshold of 80 micrograms per cubic meter. The officials said studies had also questioned the environmental and economic efficacy of a universal FGD mandate in the Indian context.

The sweeping legislation rolls back critical incentives for solar, wind, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient home improvements. The result: billions in lost investment, tens of thousands of lost jobs, and a rising sense of uncertainty among Arizona energy leaders.

A Devastating Blow: Solar and Wind Incentives Slashed

Immediate Consequences for Arizona Households and Businesses

The bill eliminates a series of federal tax credits that had helped fuel Arizona’s clean energy boom, including:

The 30% federal solar tax credit (worth about $9,000 per average installation)

Incentives for wind energy installations

Credits for purchasing electric vehicles

Home energy-efficiency upgrades

Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), these credits were originally scheduled to run through 2036. Trump’s budget bill not only ends them prematurely but also authorizes federal agencies to accelerate their removal through executive action.

As a result, Arizona residents and businesses now have only until the end of the year to capitalize on federal incentives for clean energy installations.

$58 Billion in Investment and 69,000 Jobs at Risk

Governor Katie Hobbs, in a letter to lawmakers during the bill’s debate, warned of dire economic consequences. She cited Arizona Commerce Authority figures that estimate the rollback could jeopardize:

$58 billion in planned and potential clean energy investments

69,000 high-paying construction and tech sector jobs

“These are real projects, real workers, and real dollars walking out the door,” said Michael Barrio of Advanced Energy United.

Clean Energy Projects Already Collapsing Across the State

A Wave of Closures and Cancellations

Since the bill’s passage, Arizona has seen multiple clean energy projects halted or cancelled:

Meyer Burger, a solar panel manufacturer, shuttered its Goodyear facility in May.

Nikola, an electric vehicle producer, cut 855 jobs in February.

A $1B battery plant in Buckeye was scrapped, eliminating more than 6,000 anticipated jobs.

A Casa Grande solar and electric boiler project, which would have slashed emissions by 90%, was cancelled after federal funding dried up.

Autumn Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, said industry installs are at their lowest levels since COVID. Several companies have gone bankrupt in recent months, and many more are in limbo due to mounting economic uncertainty.

Arizona’s Energy Future in Jeopardy

Climbing Utility Rates and Demand Collide with Policy Rollbacks

Arizona’s largest utility, Arizona Public Service, is proposing a 14% rate hike this year, following multiple increases in recent years. The rising cost of electricity, paired with record-breaking summer heat and population growth, puts additional strain on Arizona families.

Complicating matters further is the rise of AI and data-driven industries, which are dramatically increasing energy demand.

Clean Energy: The Only Scalable, Rapid Solution?

Energy advocates argue that renewables are the only viable short-term option to meet this surging demand. Nuclear power, often touted as an alternative, takes over a decade to build, while other technologies are still in their infancy.

“We have the sunshine and the open land,” said Johnson. “But we’re falling behind states like Texas, which have embraced renewables across party lines.”

Political Gridlock Threatens Local Response

State Lawmakers Divided as Federal Pullback Intensifies

Despite the crisis, local legislative efforts to support clean energy in Arizona have largely failed. The only pro-clean energy bill died in committee, while Governor Hobbs has vetoed several anti-clean energy proposals. The Republican-controlled legislature continues to show little interest in bridging the gap.

Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club put it bluntly: “I’m not optimistic. This federal bill is damaging, and our legislature is unlikely to act to protect Arizona’s future.”

Autumn Johnson added that while some challenges — like tariffs — are federal issues, state leaders can still step up by supporting in-state development, incentivizing adoption, and offering policy stability.

A Call for State Action: “We Still Hold the Steering Wheel”

Michael Barrio remains hopeful that Arizona can take its energy future into its own hands — if state leaders act quickly.

“Washington tapped the brakes,” he said. “But we can still grab the steering wheel and hit the accelerator. The opportunity hasn’t completely passed us by.”

Conclusion: A Fork in the Road for Arizona’s Clean Energy Future

Arizona stands on the brink of a clean energy collapse, brought on by sweeping federal changes and a lack of local legislative urgency. Yet, the state also holds the tools — abundant sunshine, open land, and a skilled workforce — to lead the renewable revolution.",https://actia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trumps-Tax-Plan-Cuts-Clean-Energy-Incentives-Putting-Billions-in-Arizona-Investment-at-Risk.webp,N,,2025-07-13 18:11:05.400522

Solar energy projects combined with energy storage can be deployed faster than conventional forms of energy.

Climate commitments Despite the scaling back of climate ambition globally, Temasek said that it will stay on course for its net-zero targets.","[SINGAPORE] Amid the global pullback on climate action and uncertain business environment, Temasek is looking to allocate the bulk of its environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments in renewable energy technologies, including transmission infrastructure as well as battery storage.

While investing in such projects may seem “plain vanilla” and also increasingly competitive –given the falling prices of solar electricity – these technologies are deemed to be “geopolitically resilient” as they are “scaled opportunities” with a “narrower range of outcomes”, said Temasek’s senior executives.

Solar energy projects combined with energy storage can be deployed faster than conventional forms of energy. It is also becoming one of the cheapest forms of energy around the world, while being inflation-protected and cashflow-generating, said Park Kyung-Ah, chief sustainability officer of Temasek.

“The opportunity sets are very compelling. People probably over-index to a lot of the headlines that keep coming out, whether it’s tariffs on certain clean energy supply chain or whether it’s in the context of pulling out of certain (climate) commitments and so forth. But we have to remember, at the end of the day for the market, the economics are what really matters,” said Park, who was speaking to The Business Times at the recent launch of its 2025 sustainability report.

Even though solar prices are falling across the board, thereby affecting the returns of such investments, Park said that there are ways to make returns by entering some markets earlier, and leveraging some of the development opportunity sets.

“It is becoming more sustainable infrastructure, which is again, more resilient, bigger growth opportunity set and cashflow visibility. And so it’s actually a compelling part of our portfolio construction,” she added.

The dislocation of some renewable energy companies in the public market – due to uncertainty around energy transition globally as the US dialled back on its climate commitments – has also provided the investor with more attractive opportunities, said chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani.

For example, Temasek, along with its partner Brookfield, acquired listed French renewable energy company Neoen for US$6.6 billion and took it private in December last year.

The pivot towards renewable energy is part of Temasek’s risk management strategy amid heightened volatility in sustainability investing. Spurred by US President Donald Trump pulling the country out of the Paris Agreement and rolling back some policies incentivising clean energy development, there has been a broader reassessment among governments and corporates on their climate ambition and strategies.

In addition to leaning more towards renewable energy, Park said the Singapore investment company would be “more selective and intentional” when investing in early stage companies.

“So we are doing early stage deals, but where there’s true differentiation and innovation, as well as where we see companies really cementing their competitive differentiation, scaling and go-to market,” she added.

Climate commitments

Despite the scaling back of climate ambition globally, Temasek said that it will stay on course for its net-zero targets.

In 2020, the investor made a commitment to halve its portfolio emissions from its 2010 levels by 2030 – to 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and is also targeting to be net zero by 2050.

For one, while the US might be retreating, Franziska Zimmermann, managing director for sustainability at Temasek, said that the European Union as a collective is still advancing on sustainability, and would likely not be impacted by developments in the US.

Secondly, Park said that delayed climate action will actually result in higher costs further down the road.

In addition, she noted that while policy stability provides investors with confidence in the return profile, Temasek does not make investment decisions with policy dependencies in mind.

“When we do our investment thesis, we want the companies to stand on their legs... There will be bumpiness along the way. And it’s the case with any industry in any market. It’s never a glide path, but the opportunity sets are very compelling,” she added.

The shifting landscape on climate has also meant that Temasek is currently in the process of revising some of its underlying assumptions behind its climate scenarios.

The investor’s current baseline scenario, which projects temperatures to rise by 1.8 degree Celsius by 2100, assumes significant acceleration in climate policy by 2025 with higher upfront transition costs.

The recent policy actions from the US, as well as the latest results from climate science, would now be factored in as part of this review, said Zimmermann.

The portfolio value of Temasek’s sustainability-aligned investments stood at S$46 billion for FY2025, an increase of S$2 billion from S$44 billion in the previous financial year.

However, the investor’s share of sustainability investments – out of its entire portfolio – dipped slightly, accounting for 11 per cent of its net portfolio value of S$434 billion after including institutional assets and liabilities, compared to 12 per cent in the previous year.

The sustainability report also reviewed Temasek’s total portfolio emissions for FY2025, which remained unchanged at 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

A majority of emissions (42.9 per cent) were attributable to Singapore Airlines, which generated higher emissions due to a strong demand for air travel and cargo uplift.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/75995b3b887981259bb57cb20a5d527d2bd4e36bd19c3edfa058abaeedbcd5ec?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-07-13 17:06:50.411948

This is after the deadline for installing FGD systems, initially slated for 2017, was repeatedly pushed, the Congress general secretary said.
Estimates suggest that anywhere between 12 per cent to 30 per cent of PM2.5 is attributable to such sulphur dioxide compounds, he said.
“The Ministry claims that sulphur dioxide levels in India are largely within the limits of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
India established stringent sulphur dioxide emission standards for coal-based power plants in December 2015, requiring compliance within two years.","With the government exempting about 78 cent per cent of coal-fired plants from installing key anti-polluting systems, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said the Environment Ministry’s rationale for the policy is based on “faulty premises”.

He asserted that the government’s policymaking will continue to be driven by “flawed metrics” in the absence of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) revision.

The former environment minister attacked the government after the central government once again extended the deadline for coal-based thermal power plants to comply with sulphur dioxide emission norms and fully exempted those located away from critically polluted areas or cities with a population of over one million.

“The Modi Government has already achieved the dubious distinction of having made India the global leader in sulphur dioxide emissions. Now we learn that the Environment Ministry has exempted 78-89 per cent of India’s thermal power plants from installing flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) systems that cut sulphur dioxide emissions,” Ramesh said in a social media post.

This is after the deadline for installing FGD systems, initially slated for 2017, was repeatedly pushed, the Congress general secretary said.

Sulphur dioxide is a direct threat to public health and has also been known to impact cloud formation, disrupting the monsoon that is the lifeline of the Indian economy, Ramesh said.

“More damagingly, research has increasingly shown that a large part of India’s ambient PM2.5 (fine particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 mm) is attributable to secondary particulate matter formed when sulphur dioxide reacts with other compounds,” he said.

Estimates suggest that anywhere between 12 per cent to 30 per cent of PM2.5 is attributable to such sulphur dioxide compounds, he said.

“The Ministry’s rationale for this policy is based on two faulty premises. The Ministry had earlier amended the focus of the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) to focus largely on PM10 emissions (particulate matter of less than 10mm diameter).

“PM10 is a lot less dangerous to human health than PM2.5 but is more obviously visible and somewhat easier to tackle, since it includes elements such as road dust.” he said.

By choosing to turn a blind eye towards PM2.5 in its policymaking, the ministry has consigned us to many years more of our ongoing public health crisis – and this decision to tolerate sulphur dioxide compounds is only set to exacerbate this trend, he said.

“The Ministry claims that sulphur dioxide levels in India are largely within the limits of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). As we have repeatedly pointed out, the NAAQS were last updated in 2009, when the prevailing levels of particulate matter and emissions were of a decidedly lower order of magnitude, and when the catastrophic public health consequences of particulate matter were not known, Ramesh said.

A revision of the NAAQS therefore is long due,” he added.

In the absence of such a revision, the ministry’s policymaking will continue to be driven by flawed metrics, Ramesh said.

India established stringent sulphur dioxide emission standards for coal-based power plants in December 2015, requiring compliance within two years.

Even after multiple extensions, 92 per cent of coal-fired power plants have not yet installed flue gas desulphurisation units to control SO2 emissions, a major air pollutant that converts into fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and causes a range of diseases.

In a notification dated July 11, the Environment Ministry said the compliance deadline for Category A plants, located within a 10-km radius of the National Capital Region or cities with a population of over one million, has been extended from December 2024 to December 2027.

Category B plants, situated within a 10-km radius of critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities, will now be assessed on a case-by-case basis instead of adhering to the earlier 2025 deadline.

Category C plants -- all others not falling under Category A or B -- have been completely exempted from the sulphur dioxide norms, provided they meet the prescribed stack height criteria by December 31, 2029. These plants were earlier required to comply by December 2026.

Of around 600 thermal power units in India, 462 are Category C units and 72 are Category B units.

The ministry said it received many representations seeking exemption or relaxation in the timelines of the emission standards due to factors such as the “limited availability of technology providers, its techno-economic feasibility, negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain, price escalation due to high demand and low supplies, low SO2 concentration in ambient air and heavy burden on consumer due to increase in electricity prices etc”.",https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 16:09:11.491904

The wind farm is expected to reduce emissions by an estimated 1.1 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent annually. That’s a serious environmental win, not just for Taiwan, but for the planet.

This project isn’t happening in isolation either. It’s part of a global financing effort, with support from other export credit agencies in Denmark, Norway, South Korea, and Taiwan. This collaborative push underscores just how international the clean energy transition is.

Minister for Exports, Gareth Thomas, said:

""This shows how the Government is boosting exports in our key growth sectors and supporting jobs across the country as part of our Plan for Change.""

""This investment will enable British innovation in renewable technology to scale up Taiwan’s clean energy transition and follows our modern Industrial Strategy, which provides up to £13 billion of direct lending for UKEF to help businesses to export.""

Trond Westlie, Group CFO of Ørsted, said:

""We’ve received very strong support from both international and local banks and export credit agencies for the project financing of Greater Changhua 2. This shows that there is a healthy appetite for premium assets with robust contractual structures, and it’s a clear sign that we’re working diligently to deliver on our divestment and partnerships programme.""

Danielle Baron, Global Head of Energy & Real Assets, Credit Agricole CIB, said:

""As the ECA Coordinator and Documentation Bank for the multi-billion financing of the Greater Changhua 2 project, Crédit Agricole CIB reaffirms its strong commitment to the renewable energy sector. This landmark transaction highlights our dedication to supporting our clients and partners in delivering society’s clean energy needs. It underscores the strength of our collaboration with UKEF and the other European Export Credit Agencies, whose contribution has been key to the development of the offshore wind sector in the APAC region.""","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_0641245f3c084c04a2d230134b808ad8~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_0641245f3c084c04a2d230134b808ad8~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-13 16:08:31.387076

Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill has ended the EV handout, much to the dismay of Elon Musk, Ford, and others trying to sell EVs to Americans who have not embraced the technology.

Business Insider reports that the race is on for automakers to sell as many EVs as possible before the $7,500 tax credit, a crucial incentive for buyers, comes to an end on September 30. President Donald Trump’s recently passed Big Beautiful Bill is set to eliminate this subsidy, which has played a significant role in making EVs more attractive to consumers.

In response to the looming deadline, Tesla and Ford are taking proactive measures to capitalize on the last-minute surge in demand. Tesla’s website prominently features a banner warning potential buyers about the expiring tax credit and urging them to take delivery by the end of September. Elon Musk’s EV giant is also reportedly sending out emails to would-be customers, emphasizing the importance of completing their purchases before the deadline to qualify for the $7,500 discount.

Analysts have cautioned that the removal of the tax credit, along with other measures in Trump’s bill targeting handouts for renewable energy, will lead to higher EV prices and significantly impact Tesla’s bottom line. However, Elon Musk has argued that the elimination of these incentives will disproportionately affect the company’s rivals and ultimately boost Tesla’s position in the long run, despite many of its vehicles currently benefiting from the tax credit.

Musk has become a vocal critic of the Big Beautiful Bill, claiming that it will increase the federal deficit and give China an advantage in the clean energy race. He has continually claimed that his rabid opposition of the bill and his personal betrayal of President Trump are not driven by the elimination of subsidies for EVs, but Trump disagrees.

In a post to Truth Social about Musk’s plan to launch a new political party, Trump commented on the Tesla CEO’s love of government money:

The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats, who have lost their confidence and their minds! Republicans, on the other hand, are a smooth running “machine,” that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country. It is a Great Bill but, unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time. I have been strongly opposed to that from the very beginning. People are now allowed to buy whatever they want — Gasoline Powered, Hybrids (which are doing very well), or New Technologies as they come about — No more EV Mandate. I have campaigned on this for two years and, quite honestly, when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate — It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had. He said he had no problems with that — I was very surprised!

Ford, meanwhile, is also taking steps to encourage buyers to act quickly. The automaker has extended its offer of a complimentary home EV charger and installation from July 8th to September 30th, coinciding with the tax credit’s expiration date. Stacey Ferreira, Ford’s head of sales strategy in the US, told Business Insider, “There’s never a better time to buy an EV than now,” citing the various incentives currently available in the marketplace.

Ferreira noted that Ford has introduced a “zero-zero-zero” incentive program, which includes zero down payment, zero payments for the first 90 days, and 0 percent interest for the first 48 months on select models. This program replaces an earlier incentive that offered employee discounts to all customers. Ferreira also pointed out that in other markets where tax credits have been phased out, there tends to be a spike in interest from consumers who haven’t yet made the switch to EVs but want to take advantage of the incentives before they disappear.

“U.S. EPA should object to this permit because it’s inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and the region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone,” Kerri Gefeke, associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “Numerous studies show that residents living near Gary Works already suffer from some of the highest rates of air pollution in the nation — resulting in high rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases.”

The petition, submitted on July 3, claims the permit “fails to include many basic provisions of the Clean Air Act,” according to a Thursday news release from the Environmental Law and Policy Center. The petition alleges that the permit renewal is missing clear and enforceable monitoring, testing and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements, according to the news release.

r

“Permitting decisions are made based on an applicant’s ability to demonstrate compliance with applicable state and federal rules and regulations, including the Clean Air Act,” IDEM responded in a Thursday statement. “The U.S. Steel Gary Works Part 70 Operating Permit was issued following an EPA review and comment period.”

U.S. Steel also responded to the petition in a Thursday statement.

“Environmental stewardship is a core value at U.S. Steel, and we remain committed to the safety of our communities as do our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees,” a spokesperson said in an email.

In addition to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, two regional groups participated in the petition: Gary Advocates for Responsible Development and Just Transition Northwest Indiana.

In the petition, the organizations argue that IDEM disregarded concerns from the EPA and commenters during the public comment period. The petition asks for the EPA to object to the renewal permit.

The petition asks IDEM to revise the renewal permit to include supplemental monitoring for various emission limits, and include contents of the continuous compliance plan and corrective action plan, among others.

Petitioners also want IDEM to provide detailed rationales in the renewal permit record about the adequacy of monitoring requirements to assure compliance, according to petition documents.

An October report from Industrious Labs found that most residents in Gary are in the top 10% of U.S. residents most at-risk for developing asthma and at-risk of low life expectancy.

Earlier this year, the American Lung Association gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm births and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. The organization also found that particle pollution can cause lung cancer.

In a statement Thursday, GARD President Dorreen Carey mentioned how Gary residents have suffered from air pollution, saying that upgrades in pollution monitoring are required to ensure public health is protected.

“EPA must object to this deficient IDEM permit renewal and require revisions to the air monitoring methodology that will include updated and supplemental monitoring of emissions and opacity limits to ensure permit compliance and current and ongoing protection of Gary residents’ health and environment,” Carey said.

Susan Thomas, director of policy and press for Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said the permit is missing “the most basic environmental management provisions,” including monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

“This dangerous situation is totally unacceptable and unprecedented, opening the door to an ‘anything goes’ model for industry pollution standards in a community that has historically been pushed to the brink,” Thomas said in a statement. “Access to clean air, safe water and healthy soil is a fundamental human right, one that Gary, and every community, deserves without compromise.”

A Smarter Solar Future Both the Build Public Renewables Act and the Big Beautiful Bill point toward a more electrified, climate-conscious future, but they take different paths.","The sun may be shining on solar in New York today, but what about tomorrow?

With a web of federal incentives and ambitious state goals, New York has become one of the top states for residential solar. But as the landmark federal Inflation Reduction Act begins to wind down key tax credits after 2025, and as New York’s own programs face funding and policy changes, many homeowners are asking: What’s next for solar in the Empire State?

In this article, we’ll break down what New York homeowners need to know about the changing solar landscape, what’s already in place, and what might be coming next. If you’re thinking about going solar—or wondering how recent policies affect your existing system—this is the time to pay attention.

The Federal Clock Is Ticking

Let’s start with the most pressing deadline: the 30% federal solar tax credit, officially called the Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D).

This credit, which allows homeowners to deduct 30% of their total solar installation cost from their federal taxes, was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. But it won’t last forever. Unless Congress acts again, this incentive will drop to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, and expire altogether by 2035.

But here’s the real catch: In order to qualify for the full 30% credit, your system must be installed and turned on by December 31, 2025.

That’s why solar providers across the country—including local companies like New York Electric & Solar, are encouraging homeowners to plan their projects now, not later. As the deadline gets closer, demand is expected to surge, leading to potential delays in permitting, utility approvals, and equipment availability.

What the Big Beautiful Bill Did (and Didn’t Do)

In July 2025, the U.S. Congress passed what’s officially known as H.R. 1 — but what many in the media have dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill.” This sweeping piece of federal legislation made major changes to tax policy, energy funding, and climate programs nationwide. For homeowners interested in going solar, it’s especially important to understand what this bill did — and what it didn’t do.

One of the most significant impacts of the Big Beautiful Bill was its rollback of clean energy tax credits that had previously been expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act. This includes a phase-out of the 30% Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit (Section 25D) — the credit that homeowners use to reduce the cost of installing solar panels. Under the new federal law, the credit is set to expire after December 31, 2025, unless further action is taken. For many homeowners, this makes 2025 the final window to access the full federal incentive.

In addition to cutting tax credits, the bill introduced stricter requirements for solar equipment sourcing — including new rules around foreign entities and domestic content. While these changes aim to boost American manufacturing, they also add complexity for solar installers and may impact equipment availability or pricing.

What the Big Beautiful Bill did not do, however, is directly affect New York State’s climate legislation, including the much-discussed Build Public Renewables Act, which passed at the state level in 2023.

What New York’s Build Public Renewables Act Actually Covers

Before the Big Beautiful Bill, New York passed its own landmark climate legislation: the Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA). Signed into law in 2023, this bill expanded the authority of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop, build, and operate large-scale renewable energy projects across the state.

The BPRA was a major win for public power advocates, particularly in terms of equity. It gave NYPA the green light to build clean energy infrastructure in underserved communities, ensuring a more just transition to renewable energy. It also created pathways for union jobs and emphasized long-term decarbonization of the state’s power grid.

But here’s the key point for homeowners: the Build Public Renewables Act does not provide new financial incentives for residential solar. It focuses primarily on utility-scale and community-level clean energy. While it strengthens the grid and supports statewide sustainability goals, it doesn’t lower out-of-pocket costs for individual families looking to install solar panels on their rooftops.

So Where Does That Leave Homeowners?

The combination of these two bills; one federal, one state, paints a clear picture:

New York’s Build Public Renewables Act is a long-term infrastructure strategy that strengthens the role of public power but doesn’t provide direct financial help for homeowners.

The federal Big Beautiful Bill (H.R. 1), on the other hand, reduces or removes the tax incentives that homeowners have relied on to make solar affordable.

That’s why, for New Yorkers thinking about going solar, 2025 is a crucial year. To lock in the 30% federal tax credit, your system must be fully installed and connected to the grid by December 31, 2025 — no exceptions.

Start with a free consultation

Make sure your system is installed and interconnected by the end of the year.

Secure your 30% federal tax credit before it’s gone.

And remember, while New York’s commitment to clean energy remains strong, there’s no replacement on the books yet for the federal residential credit that’s set to expire. If you wait until 2026, you may be paying significantly more out of pocket.

A Smarter Solar Future

Both the Build Public Renewables Act and the Big Beautiful Bill point toward a more electrified, climate-conscious future, but they take different paths. New York is investing in public infrastructure. The federal government is shifting focus toward domestic manufacturing and energy security. But for homeowners, it’s clear: 2025 is your moment.

As Inside EVs reported, Ionity announced it will begin rolling out new ultra-fast chargers across Europe in the second half of 2025. These chargers will be capable of adding up to 186 miles of range in under eight minutes, making road trips and daily commutes much more convenient for EV drivers.

Although EVs available in today’s European market can’t tap into this level of power yet, this upgrade lays the groundwork for the next generation of EVs. The system is also designed to be more efficient overall, sharing power between vehicles when multiple cars are plugged into the same station.

Faster charging means less time waiting at the charging station and more time living. Whether commuting, running errands, driving for rideshare services, or taking a family road trip, shorter charging stops reduce downtime, ease scheduling stress, and can help shave money off travel costs.

With less time spent charging, EV ownership becomes even more practical and accessible.

On a broader scale, the faster flow of traffic at charging stations can help cut congestion at these stations and make the act of owning and driving an EV that much more of a no-brainer for drivers. That will lead to less tailpipe pollution, especially in cities, and roughly halve the total pollution per mile driven, according to MIT.

By speeding up the turnover at charging spots, this shift can bring cleaner air, quieter streets, and a healthier planet for everyone.

Some companies are also factoring charging infrastructure into their cars’ software. As The EV Report noted on LinkedIn, Audi’s route planner can “streamline the search for charging stations.”

When you pair faster EV charging with solar power at home, the benefits add up even more. By powering your car with energy from rooftop panels, you can significantly reduce your electricity bills and make an especially meaningful impact on the environment. EnergySage allows you to compare quotes from trusted installers and save thousands on solar installations.

Ionity CEO Jeroen van Tilburg said in the press release that the rollout represents “another key milestone in our mission to deliver ultra‑fast, convenient charging at scale for EV drivers across Europe.”",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EuropeEV-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:56.891023

I never got there, being a workaholic. I was mainly a Cairo guy during my nearly 4 years off and on in that country.

So I didn’t know anything about Ras Gareb, about a hundred miles north of Hurghada on the Red Sea, and more specifically on the latter’s Gulf of El Zayt. The same Gustave Eiffel who designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris was hired by Ottoman viceroy Khedive Ismail in 1871 to design a lighthouse at Ras Gareb. Ras Gareb was only founded as a town in 1932, because there is an oil field in the area. It is a small town, probably with a population of less than 50,000. So this part of Egypt is already entangled in modernism — the lighthouse was for Red Sea steamship traffic.

Now, it is now the site of the largest wind farm on the African continent, and a complex of two wind farms there now generates nearly a gigawatt (914 megawatts) of power, enough to provide electricity to 1.1 million Egyptian households!

Back in the 1950s, when Egypt wanted to build an Aswan Dam, it initially went to the US because of its wealth and expertise. When Washington tried to dominate Egypt and cut it off from its Eastern European markets, Cairo rebelled and turned to the Soviet Union to finish the dam.

But now the United States and Russia aren’t in the picture for this enormous infrastructure project. Japan and France are.

Toyota Tsusho built Gulf of Suez Wind Farm I near Ras Gareb in 2019, with a a power generation capacity of 262.5 megawatts.

The company then partnered with its partially owned subsidiary, Japan’s Eurus Energy, which is also partly owned by TEPCO; with France’s Engie S.A., and with Egypt’s Orascom Construction PLC to create a truly vast wind farm with really huge turbines, the Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II.

And now, ESI Africa reports the Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II is fully operational, having added 150 megawatts in capacity in March. It is therefore putting out 654 megawatts.

The new wind farm cost $790 million, having begun construction in 2023. The financing was handled by Japanese banks, a French one, and by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. A Japanese concern covered the insurance. The speed with which Toyota Tsusho and its partners erected this massive project is just incredible, and it underlines why wind and solar are the future. The installation has 104 turbines. Twenty of them are so gigantic that they each put out 7.5 megawatts. The other 84 aren’t chopped liver, either, each with a 6 megawatt nameplate capacity.

Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II is now fully connected to the Egyptian grid. Along with Wind Farm I at the same location t will power as many households as there are in the entire state of Kansas. It is a 25-year contract and Japan will repatriate profits from it.

Trump’s United States will not. Of wind power, Trump said, “We’re not going to be having that.”

Egypt wants 42% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, and this new large Japanese-built wind complex will help it meet that (overly modest) goal.

“Suez Wind,” Digital, Dream / Dreamland v3 / Clip2Comic, 2025

Rendering of the NuScale VOYGR SMR power plant approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.

The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.

“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”

Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.

In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”

The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.

But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.

In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.

In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.

Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.

Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.

“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”

But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.

“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”

Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.

“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.

Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.

Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”

The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.

The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.

The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.

“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”

Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.

‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.

Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?

“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”

Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.

“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”

Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.

“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”",https://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nuscale-Nucllear-Power-Plant.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 14:07:47.045118

When congressional Republicans decided to cut some Biden-era energy subsidies to help fund their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, they could have pruned wasteful subsidies while sparing the rest. Instead, they did the reverse. Americans will pay the price with higher costs for dirtier energy.

The nearly 900-page bill that President Donald Trump signed on July 4, slashes incentives for wind and solar energy, batteries, electric cars and home efficiency while expanding subsidies for fossil fuels and biofuels. That will leave Americans burning more fossil fuels despite strong public and scientific support for shifting to renewable energy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which energy technologies could rapidly cut emissions or need a financial boost to become viable from those that are already profitable but harm the environment. Unfortunately, the Republican bill favors the latter while stifling the former.

Cuts to renewable electricity: Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, provide over 90 percent of the new electricity added nationally and around the world in recent years. Natural gas turbines are in short supply, and there are long lead times to build nuclear power plants. Wind and solar energy projects — with batteries to store excess power until it’s needed — offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power. Recent technological breakthroughs put geothermal power on the verge of rapid growth.

However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It accelerates the phaseout of tax credits for factories that manufacture equipment needed for renewable energy and electric vehicles. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that had been stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Efforts to build new wind and solar farms will be hit even harder. To receive any tax credits, those projects will need to commence construction by mid-2026 or come online by the end of 2027. The act preserves a slower timeline for phasing out subsidies for nuclear, geothermal and hydrogen projects, which take far longer to build than wind and solar farms.

However, even projects that could be built soon enough will struggle to comply with the bill’s restrictions on using Chinese-made components. Tax law experts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible. For example, even American-made solar panels may rely on components sourced from China or Chinese-owned companies.

Princeton University professor Jesse Jenkins estimates that the bill will mean wind and solar power generate 820 fewer terawatt-hours in 2035 than under previous policies. That’s more power than all U.S. coal-fired power plants generated in 2023.

That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who is backed by the oil and gas industry.

Electric cars and efficiency: Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The quickest phaseout comes for tax credits for electric vehicles, which will end on Sept. 30. And since the bill eliminates fines on car companies that fail to meet fuel economy standards, other new cars are likely to guzzle more gas.

Tax credits for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows and energy audits will end at the end of 2025. Homeowners will also lose tax credits for installing solar panels at the end of the year, seven years earlier than under the previous law.

The bill also rescinds funding that would have helped cut diesel emissions and finance clean energy projects in underserved communities.

Support for biofuels and fossil fuels: Biofuels and fossil fuels fared far better under the bill. Tens of billions of dollars will be spent to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the effects of biofuels on land use.

Meanwhile, the bill opens more federal lands and waters to leasing for oil and gas drilling and coal mining. It also slashes the royalties that companies pay to the federal government for fuels extracted from publicly owned land. And a new tax credit will subsidize metallurgical coal, which is mainly exported to steelmakers overseas.

The bill also increases subsidies for using captured carbon dioxide to extract more oil and gas from the ground. That makes it less likely that captured emissions will only be sequestered to combat climate change.

The result: With fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects that the law will increase household energy costs by more than $280 per year by 2035 above what they would have been without the bill. The extra fossil fuel-burning will negate 470 million tons of anticipated emissions reductions that year, a 7 percent bump.

The bill will also leave America’s clean energy transition further behind China, which is deploying more solar and wind power and electric vehicles than the rest of the world combined.

No one expected President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both chambers of Congress, even though many of its projects were in Republican-voting districts. Still, pairing cuts to clean energy with support for fossil fuels makes Trump’s bill uniquely harmful to the world’s climate and to Americans’ wallets.

On the first day of his presidency, President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency, pledging an aggressive push for energy dominance. His action builds on the goal of energy independence that was prevalent since the 1970s oil crisis, but now the ambition goes beyond freeing the United States from foreign oil by leveraging US energy abundance as a strategic asset.

Yet for all the rhetoric, the concept remains loosely defined. Going a step beyond mere self-sufficiency, the administration wants energy to be reliable, affordable, and abundant—and domestically-sourced wherever possible. The following pillars of energy abundance emerge: solidifying American leadership in fossil fuel production and exports, rejuvenating the American nuclear and coal industries, a deregulatory push, securing supply chains, and abandoning the federal pursuit of decarbonization.

These priorities aim toward reducing American dependency on foreign imports, growing the economy, and addressing the rising national debt and budget imbalances.

Dominant in What?

Trump’s vision of energy dominance centers on American strengths: oil, gas, coal, and nuclear. In stark contrast to the 1970s, today, the United States shapes international energy markets as a net exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) and as a prominent producer of liquids —crude oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). According to the Texas Oil and Gas Association, in 2024, the U.S. generated as much crude oil and NGLs as it consumed from a volumetric standpoint.

In this area, the United States has achieved its energy independence goals. American producers operate in a robust cost environment: many shale fields remain profitable at oil prices near $70/barrel, enabling their flexibility and competitiveness throughout production cycles. Geopolitically, American LNG exports have undercut Russia’s energy revenues and strengthened its ties with the EU, Japan, South Korea, China, and Turkey, which are major purchasers of American LNG.

Deregulation is another pillar of energy dominance. By lifting permitting hurdles and rolling back environmental regulations, the administration’s goal is to halt the early retirement of coal plants, and accelerate the building of pipeline, other LNG infrastructure, and refining projects. In practice, this involves revisiting aspects of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and easing carbon-capture mandates. This is likely to benefit the coal industry most of all.

Energy dominance also involves resilient supply chains, particularly for critical minerals like lithium, graphite, and rare earths. With China currently dominating the production and processing of these materials, the United States has begun “friend-shoring” (relocating processing to allied nations or domestically) to control the entire energy supply chain from extraction to manufacturing.

Not an “All of the Above” Solution

The administration focuses on energy sources that deliver dispatchable, “always-on” electricity. Besides fossil fuels, conventional nuclear energy, alongside small modular nuclear reactors, is a scalable baseload solution. If the United States successfully exports its domestic nuclear designs, it will forge long-lasting alliances with the recipients of these technologies. These relationships could span a hundred years due to the nuclear plants’ longevity. Support for nuclear power is further fueled by the urgent energy needs of the data center industry. Energy dominance will help the United States maintain its current leadership in the AI race, a position that is constantly challenged by China.

Notably, however, wind and solar have been sidelined in the energy dominance narrative. The first Secretarial Order by Chris Wright, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, does not address these technologies at all. Despite excellent wind and solar resources in the United States, there has been little federal push to compete with China in renewable hardware or electric vehicle battery supply chains. The United States seems to be at peace with letting China lead the clean energy transition.

President Trump is unapologetic that his energy policy is unconstrained by the greenhouse gas emissions profile of the energy sector. This is a clear break from Joe Biden’s ambitious targets for solar and wind sectors; for example, the prior administration’s thirty gigawatts (GW) target for offshore wind installed capacity by 2030 is now clearly unachievable.

The Gambit for Dominance

Energy dominance isn’t just a slogan. It is a deliberate, multi-layered strategy akin to an industrial policy that emphasizes US market-share expansion and supply chain control. Energy is not merely a commodity, but also a tool of economic statecraft.

True dominance requires long-term investments, sustained international partnerships, a stable business environment with high amounts of certainty in government policy, continued technological leadership, and a non-confrontational trade policy that builds alliances. The United States may gain leverage abroad and cheaper fuel at home, but its current approach increases the risks of isolation and trade conflicts.

Moreover, energy dominance might not mix well with trade tariffs. For example, the US and Canadian electric grids are integrated, and the tariffs might create issues shifting energy across the border.

Still, for now, the US seems to hold a strong hand. It has access to cheap, abundant hydrocarbons and is home to the largest nuclear power plant fleet in the world. Yet energy dominance is not a destination—it is a statement of policy priorities that must continuously adapt to shifting markets and alliances. The current interpretation of energy dominance also leaves out US leadership in clean energy, which might not be the best approach in the long run.

FAQ 1.Do Mercedes EQ Models Qualify For The Federal EV Tax Credit?
Some Mercedes EQ models, like the U.S.-assembled EQB SUV, may qualify for federal EV tax credits.
4.How Do I Claim The EV Tax Credit For A Mercedes EQ Vehicle?","So, you’re thinking about making the jump into a Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle—maybe the sleek EQS Sedan, the versatile EQB SUV, or something new in the pipeline. But before you plug in and hit the road, let’s talk about one of the most satisfying parts of going electric:

The EV tax credit. It’s like getting rewarded for being both eco-conscious and style-savvy. But the truth is, the world of tax credits for Mercedes-Benz EQ models isn’t just plug-and-play. There are eligibility criteria, evolving legislation, and a few surprises along the way.

Eligibility Criteria For EV Tax Credits

First things first—let’s talk federal. The Federal EV Tax Credit offers up to $7,500 off your tax bill if you buy a qualified clean vehicle. But not every electric model qualifies. The rules now consider where the car is assembled, where battery components come from, and even where the minerals are sourced.

And here’s the kicker: the vehicle needs to be new, have a price under certain caps (around $80,000 for SUVs), and you—the buyer—must meet income limits. These rules evolved after the Inflation Reduction Act, so what worked in 2023 may not apply now in 2025.

Specific Requirements For Mercedes EQ Models

So where does that leave our beloved Mercedes-Benz EV models? Well, some do qualify, some don’t—at least not for the full credit. For example, the U.S.-assembled EQB SUV may qualify for partial credit depending on the trim and final assembly location. Meanwhile, the German-made EQS Sedan typically doesn’t qualify for federal incentives, though it still shines with national offers and dealer finance specials.

The best way to check? Head to the dealership’s finance center or use IRS tools to confirm current qualification status by Mercedes-Benz model and VIN.

Differentiating Between EVs And PHEVs

This is where things get tricky. Not all electric vehicles are fully electric. Some are PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). That matters. PHEVs like the upcoming 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid can qualify for reduced federal tax credits—based on battery size and electric-only range.

So while a hybrid electric vehicle might not be as “clean” as a full EV, it can still put some cash back in your pocket if it meets IRS benchmarks.

Available Tax Credits For Mercedes EQ Models

List of Eligible Mercedes EQ Models

As of June 2025, here’s a quick look at how Mercedes-Benz EQ models align with tax credits:

EQB SUV: May qualify (assembled in the U.S. in some cases)

EQS Sedan: Generally doesn’t qualify for federal, but special offers often available

GLC Plug-in Hybrid (new model): Expected to receive partial credit

Certified pre-owned Mercedes-Benz EV models: Eligible for used EV tax credit (details below)

Keep in mind that vehicle specials may apply regardless of federal incentives. You can often find shopping tools, finance specials, and lease return deals to stack savings.

Insights On The Mercedes-Benz EQ Lineup

The Mercedes EQ vehicle lineup is growing fast. From the flagship EQS Sedan with its hyper-luxury interior to the family-ready EQB SUV, there’s an electric car for nearly every lifestyle. These vehicles feature cutting-edge EQ Technology, built-in DC fast charging support, and tech-heavy dashboards that feel straight out of 2030.

And yes, even if a model doesn’t qualify for a tax credit, it’s hard to ignore the value of driving a luxury electric vehicle that blends performance, Mercedes-Benz S-Class comfort, and futuristic design.

How To Claim The Federal Tax Credit

Steps to Applying for the Tax Credit

If you’re buying an eligible new Mercedes-Benz EV, claiming the EV tax credit is pretty straightforward:

Confirm vehicle eligibility: Verify the model and trim qualify on the IRS website.

File IRS Form 8936: You’ll need this form when doing your taxes.

Use your Payment Calculator: Work with the finance center to estimate post-credit pricing.

Retain documents: Purchase agreement, VIN, and dealership verification of tax credit eligibility.

Just remember: this is a tax credit, not a rebate. It reduces your owed federal tax—not the vehicle’s sticker price.

Required Documentation And Forms

In most cases, you’ll need:

IRS Form 8936 (Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit)

Purchase agreement with VIN

Dealership’s documentation showing Mercedes-Benz qualify status for the selected model

If the vehicle qualifies, your tax return will reflect the full or partial credit as a deduction on what you owe Uncle Sam.

Understanding Pre-Owned EV Tax Credits

Federal Pre-Owned EV Tax Credit Overview

Buying used? There’s still good news. A federal pre-owned EV tax credit of up to $4,000 is now available. This applies to certified pre-owned vehicles or even pre-owned specials under $25,000—great news if you’re eyeing a slightly older EQ model.

But again, you must buy from a licensed dealer, and the vehicle must be at least two model years old.

Criteria For Pre-Owned Mercedes EQ Models

To qualify for the used EV credit, the pre-owned Mercedes-Benz must:

Be from the Mercedes-Benz EQ family (like a 2022 EQB or EQS)

Be priced under $25,000

Not have been sold as a credit-claimed vehicle before

Be used by the buyer (not resold immediately)

Certified dealerships like Autonation Inc often stock qualifying models, and they’ll help you navigate the finance application and related paperwork.

Maximizing Tax Credit Benefits

Leveraging Dealer Advice and Resources

Dealers are your secret weapon here. Many Mercedes-Benz retailers offer shopping tools, calculators, and express service for quick inspections and EV evaluations. Ask about Mercedes-Benz Partner Programs that may offer additional savings or employer discounts.

Oh—and don’t skip the parts specials if you’re personalizing your new EQ ride.

Strategies For Maximizing Savings

Want to stack your savings? Try this:

Start with a new vehicle special or pre-owned vehicle special

Apply your tax credit at tax time

Use dealer finance specials to lower your APR

Explore national offers and Mercedes-Benz certified vehicles for extra perks

Even if the federal credit doesn’t fully apply, many EQ models are supported by state-level incentives and Electrify America charging promotions. Combined, these can make your first year of ownership surprisingly cost-effective.

Considerations For New EV Technologies

Innovations in 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid

The 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid is particularly exciting. It’s a hybrid electric vehicle that blends traditional gasoline power with an extended electric-only range—ideal if you’re transitioning from gas to electric. Plus, it’s expected to meet requirements for partial EV credits, making it a sweet middle ground.

It also features upgraded DC fast charging, real-time battery monitoring, and next-gen EQ Technology that rivals even full EVs in driving smoothness and power delivery.

Benefits Of Adopting New Technologies

Let’s be honest—early adopters get perks. Beyond the tax credit, you’re getting:

Lower maintenance vs. gas cars

Quiet, ultra-smooth rides

Access to priority parking and HOV lanes in many cities

Support from Mercedes-Benz’s expanding new inventory of service-friendly EVs

Plus, innovations in electric cars work best when adopted early—like over-the-air updates and smart charging networks.

Broader Context Of Qualified Clean Vehicle Tax Credits

Overview of Other Eligible Manufacturers and Models

Mercedes isn’t alone in the game. Other eligible electric vehicle makers include Ford (F-150 Lightning), Tesla (Model Y), and Rivian. However, few match the luxury and refinement of a Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle—especially in interior design and brand status.

So while others qualify, driving a Mercedes EQ vehicle is about more than credits. It’s about lifestyle, confidence, and long-term vision.

Insights From Dealership Locations

Whether you’re browsing in-person or online, dealership support is everything. The Mercedes-Benz Finance Center can:

Check current recall information

Confirm pre-owned vehicle specials

Help submit your finance application

Navigate new Mercedes-Benz inventory vs. certified pre-owned inventory

Some even offer lease return programs with flexible upgrade options—perfect if you’re planning to switch from gas to electric over time.

Final Thoughts

Here’s the truth: EV tax credits aren’t one-size-fits-all. But if you’re strategic, they can tip the scales in favor of a smarter, cleaner investment. Whether it’s a new Mercedes-Benz EV, a pre-owned Mercedes-Benz, or an upcoming hybrid electric vehicle, the key is knowing your options.

And when you pair all that tech and style with a little money back at tax time? That’s what I call a win.

Used EV prices fell nearly 32% in 2024 from 2023, almost 10 times the drop in used gas-powered car prices, according to iSeeCars.com, an automotive research site.

Last year, the average used EV cost around $30,900, in line with the average used gas car, even though a new EV sells for $17,300 more than a comparable gas model on average.

Discounts have drawn in buyers like Christopher Andrzejczak, a systems engineer from Orlando, Fla., who has owned five EVs over the past decade. Last year, he picked up a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,000 miles on it for $36,000—less than half of its sticker price.

That price included an extended warranty and several upgrades like tinted windows that the previous owner had paid for.

Deals on used EVs are especially pronounced because EVs lose value faster than gas-powered cars once they drive off the lot. The depreciation often reflects concerns about battery life and longevity. Replacing a battery out of warranty is costly but uncommon. New technology could quickly make a used EV antiquated. The vehicles also require specialized parts and labor that make them more expensive to repair when something goes wrong.

“I was like, You know what? I’m willing to take a risk on that,” Andrzejczak said. The previous owner “probably took a terrible depreciation hit.”

In the new-car market, higher sticker prices and the fast pace of depreciation can make it hard for many car shoppers to justify going green.

New electric vehicles cost about $800 more a year to own than gas-powered cars when factoring in fuel, maintenance, insurance and fees. But removing the cost of depreciation results in a saving of more than $900 annually versus a gas car, according to an analysis of AAA data. EVs have lower fuel and maintenance costs, but cost more to insure.

In 2024, charging an EV at home worked out to the equivalent of about $1.41 a gallon of gas, according to the Energy Department. That is less than half of what most drivers paid at the pump last year.

EV owners spend roughly half as much on upkeep and repairs compared with gas-car drivers, according to Consumer Reports. Over the life of the car, that adds up to about $4,600 in maintenance costs for an EV compared with $9,200 for a traditional one.

Used cars also don’t depreciate as quickly. In January, Andrzejczak purchased a used 2021 Audi E-Tron Prestige for $27,000, with the intent to get ahead of tariffs and eventually gift it to his teenage son. When his son made it clear he wasn’t interested in March, Andrzejczak sold the car to Carvana for $26,000.

“It’s like I borrowed it for a few months for $1,000,” he said.

Jason Wallace, who owns Electrified Autos, a used EV dealership in Joplin, Mo., says more buyers are realizing they can save money by making the switch to electric. In an economy pinched by years of inflation and high interest rates, he said, “that’s all that matters to them.”

The used-car dealership has been in Wallace’s family since 1975 when his grandfather opened it, but Wallace and his brother made the decision to focus exclusively on selling electric vehicles last year. So far, it has paid off.

“There’s demand for EVs at the right price,” he said. “Not everyone is going to spend $60,000 on a car but they will look harder when it’s $20,000 or less, and we have no problem selling those.”

Another reason for the rush is looming changes in EV policy. A $4,000 federal tax credit for used EVs is set to expire at the end of September as a result of the new tax law passed earlier this month. The $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, which made new models more affordable and helped keep prices down in the used market, is also expiring at the same time.

Eli Cook decided to buy an electric vehicle after researching gas prices in the Bay Area. He and his wife, both recent college graduates, plan to move there from Missouri later this year for work. Expecting far higher gas prices in California than Missouri, the couple wanted something affordable and efficient. As newlyweds, they are determined to avoid going into debt.

Used EV sales topped 100,000 for the first time in the second quarter, according to industry-services business Cox Automotive. It is a rare bright spot for the EV industry, which is contending with lackluster demand and the looming elimination of federal tax credits. Sales for new EVs fell in each of the last three months.

What buyers are finding in the used market is deals. Used EV prices fell nearly 32% in 2024 from 2023, almost 10 times the drop in used gas-powered car prices, according to iSeeCars.com, an automotive research site.

Last year, the average used EV cost around $30,900, in line with the average used gas car, even though a new EV sells for $17,300 more than a comparable gas model on average.

Discounts have drawn in buyers like Christopher Andrzejczak, a systems engineer from Orlando, Fla., who has owned five EVs over the past decade. Last year, he picked up a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,000 miles on it for $36,000—less than half of its sticker price.

That price included an extended warranty and several upgrades like tinted windows that the previous owner had paid for.

Deals on used EVs are especially pronounced because EVs lose value faster than gas-powered cars once they drive off the lot. The depreciation often reflects concerns about battery life and longevity. Replacing a battery out of warranty is costly but uncommon. New technology could quickly make a used EV antiquated. The vehicles also require specialized parts and labor that make them more expensive to repair when something goes wrong.

EV owners spend roughly half as much on upkeep and repairs compared with gas-car drivers, according to Consumer Reports. Over the life of the car, that adds up to about $4,600 in maintenance costs for an EV compared with $9,200 for a traditional one.

Used cars also don’t depreciate as quickly. In January, Andrzejczak purchased a used 2021 Audi E-Tron Prestige for $27,000, with the intent to get ahead of tariffs and eventually gift it to his teenage son. When his son made it clear he wasn’t interested in March, Andrzejczak sold the car to Carvana for $26,000.

“It’s like I borrowed it for a few months for $1,000,” he said.

Jason Wallace, who owns Electrified Autos, a used EV dealership in Joplin, Mo., says more buyers are realizing they can save money by making the switch to electric. In an economy pinched by years of inflation and high interest rates, he said, “that’s all that matters to them.”

The used-car dealership has been in Wallace’s family since 1975 when his grandfather opened it, but Wallace and his brother made the decision to focus exclusively on selling electric vehicles last year. So far, it has paid off.

“There’s demand for EVs at the right price,” he said. “Not everyone is going to spend $60,000 on a car but they will look harder when it’s $20,000 or less, and we have no problem selling those.”

Another reason for the rush is looming changes in EV policy. A $4,000 federal tax credit for used EVs is set to expire at the end of September as a result of the new tax law passed earlier this month. The $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, which made new models more affordable and helped keep prices down in the used market, is also expiring at the same time.

Eli Cook decided to buy an electric vehicle after researching gas prices in the Bay Area. He and his wife, both recent college graduates, plan to move there from Missouri later this year for work. Expecting far higher gas prices in California than Missouri, the couple wanted something affordable and efficient. As newlyweds, they are determined to avoid going into debt.

They could have waited until after the move, but worried they would miss out on the tax credit. Last month, they paid $15,000 cash for a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The window sticker, Cook said, showed it had sold for nearly $40,000 four years earlier.

“It really seems like we’re buying the dip for used EVs right now,” he said.

The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.
“The technology has matured.” The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.
Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.
Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.","Ameren is looking to build a natural gas-fired power plant and the company’s first large lithium-ion battery facility on the Jefferson County site of its former coal-based Rush Island Energy Center, which closed last year after continuous Clean Air Act violations.

The St. Louis-based electric utility will call the complex the Big Hollow Energy Center, the company announced late last month. Collectively, the 800-megawatt gas plant and the 400-megawatt battery storage facility would roughly match the generating potential that Rush Island had, taking advantage of the site’s existing transmission capacity and access to the power grid.

“That was the idea,” said Ajay Arora, Ameren Missouri’s senior vice president and chief development officer. “The infrastructure is extremely valuable … certainly the transmission aspect of it.”

The proposed switch to gas at one of its former coal plant sites follows a familiar playbook for Ameren. The utility is also building an 800-megawatt gas plant — called the Castle Bluff Energy Center — for about $800 million at the former site of its smallest and oldest coal plant, the Meramec Energy Center in south St. Louis County, which closed at the end of 2022.

The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.

Ameren said it intends for the new facility to play a similar role, “as a reliable backup source of energy,” with the gas plant designed to provide power when demand peaks on cold winter days, hot summer afternoons, and to support the grid when renewable generation is unavailable.

Meanwhile, the project’s energy storage component would do much of the same. For instance, the batteries could be charged when cheap, excess energy is on the grid and then used when needed, in any weather conditions.

“Fully charged, the entire array could power thousands of homes for hours and help overall grid reliability, especially during times of peak energy needs,” Ameren said in its announcement.

While the site offers plenty of existing attributes, such as its readymade transmission access, Ameren said that the Rush Island building could not be retrofitted to accommodate the new projects, and that its demolition is already underway.

Ameren still needs approval from state utility regulators before proceeding with its Big Hollow proposal, which it hopes to receive by March. The company then aims to complete the project by 2028.

The utility said that the estimated cost of the project is currently confidential.

‘About time’ for battery storage

Ameren’s plans for the Rush Island site’s redevelopment have elicited some mixed reactions from energy experts — and raised questions about costs.

For example, the company’s push to build new generation and aid grid reliability comes as it says it faces a wave of demand from prospective developers of highly energy-intensive projects, like data centers.

Utilities are fielding similar requests nationwide, although Missouri has not yet seen the explosions in energy demand that so far have been concentrated in scattershot places across the map, such as Virginia, Texas and North Dakota.

Predicting if or when that wave of demand could materialize in Missouri is one challenge that now confronts regional utilities and state regulators, raising questions about how to shoulder costs of energy projects that largely cater to heavy users, and carrying risks of a possible “overbuild” that leaves customers on the hook for hefty investments.

“The question is what supply should be built and how do you pay for it?” said Ashok Gupta, a Kansas City-based energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

While the payment question will eventually be part of the regulatory review process for Ameren’s Big Hollow proposal, it is also being broadly examined and debated in separate cases before the Missouri Public Service Commission. For example, outside groups and watchdog agencies that police utility spending will soon weigh in on cases about how to serve large-load customers seeking power from the state’s biggest electric utilities: Ameren and Kansas City-based Evergy.

Federal energy policy whiplash out of Washington now “makes the calculus even harder” in determining what to build and when to build it, Gupta said, as tax credits for wind and solar projects are now set to lapse within a couple years — projects that represent the bulk of new power generation in the U.S.

But costs at Big Hollow could at least partially be reduced by federal tax credits for battery storage projects. Unlike the tax credits for wind and solar, those for battery storage projects were spared the widespread cuts contained in the massive spending bill passed by Congressional Republicans this month, and signed by President Donald Trump.

Some, like Gupta, cheered the battery portion of the proposed project.

“It’s about time,” said Gupta, noting that storage can nicely complement renewable energy and smooth out issues with intermittent generation, whenever solar or wind generation stops or slows. “It’s exciting, it’s necessary.”

Ameren said its battery investment aligns with industry trends and that it can learn from other utilities that adopted the technology earlier.

“A lot of our peer utilities are investing heavily in batteries,” said Arora, the Ameren senior vice president. “The technology has matured.”

The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.

Gas has had issues with reliability and affordability at times, particularly in the extreme weather conditions when peaker plants are needed, as illustrated during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when gas plants faltered and fuel prices skyrocketed.

And building gas plants, themselves, has become considerably more expensive in recent years, with costs tripling amid high demand and long waits for gas turbines, said John Ketchum, the CEO of NextEra Energy, a giant Florida-based utility, at recent energy conferences in March and June.

Gupta, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, questioned Ameren’s choice to pursue a simple-cycle gas plant — a less efficient alternative than combined-cycle gas plants, which recover exhaust heat and use it to generate additional power.

“You’re gonna burn all this gas. Let’s get as much energy as possible,” Gupta said.

Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.

Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.

“The lowest-cost resource is still energy efficiency,” said Gupta. “We should be doing hundreds if not thousands of megawatts of energy efficiency to keep energy affordable.”

Filling the void

The proposed next chapter for the site would mark the coda to Rush Island’s unique — and criminal — background. Between 2007 and 2010, Ameren illegally modified the plant’s generators near the end of their intended lifespan without obtaining permits — enabling them to produce more energy and emit more air pollutants, and sparking a decade-plus lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice.

The plant was one of a dwindling number of U.S. coal plants that did not have widely adopted pollution controls, called scrubbers, that remove sulfur dioxide, or SO2, from emissions. Ameren’s biggest coal plant, the Labadie Energy Center west of St. Louis, also lacks scrubbers and emits far more SO2 than any other U.S. coal plant.

A judge in the marathon legal case over the plant’s air pollution sought to have the company offset Rush Island’s illegal SO2 emissions by reducing Labadie’s emissions by an equal amount. But an appeals court scrapped that order, saying that Ameren was never given notice of an alleged Clean Air Act violation at Labadie — despite the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency had issued “Notices of Violation” to the company about that very issue at Labadie, years ago.

The company ultimately reached an agreement to pay $61 million for electric school buses and charging equipment, as well as the distribution of air purifiers to residential customers, prioritizing low-income households.

The new plans for the site bring potential relief to local leaders dealing with lost tax revenue from Rush Island’s closure. For instance, the Jefferson R-VII School District will see a budget reduction of $1.1 million in the upcoming school year, thanks to the plant’s retirement.

“It’s a tough number to look at,” said David Haug, the district superintendent.

But the site’s planned redevelopment figures to eventually bring the money back. And it would provide longer-term certainty and stability compared to Rush Island, with Haug saying it felt as if the “clock was ticking” throughout the aging plant’s later years, as both the facility and the school district’s finances faced an unclear future.

“It was certainly a good day when we became aware that this was official,” Haug said. “This is a big, long-term win for the district.”

ByDan Gearino for Inside Climate News

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on July 7 that he said will “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources” such as wind and solar.

But it’s not clear whether the order will have much of an effect other than to underscore the president’s antipathy for those power sources. Some observers speculate this action is fulfilling a promise to hardline conservative House members in order to win their votes last week for the massive budget reconciliation bill.

The order is titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.” It directs the Treasury department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits” as specified by the bill.

Related | Trump thinks 'windmills are killing our country'—yes, really

The legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, says that projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027. This is a rapid phaseout compared to the previous law that had a phaseout that was to begin in 2032.

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines. It also says the department must take prompt action to follow the bill’s new limits on tax credits going to entities with ties to China.

In addition, it says the Department of the Interior must revise any policies or practices that give solar and wind power preferential treatment compared to other energy sources.

The Treasury and Interior departments also must make reports within 45 days about how they are complying with the order.

Analysts, lawmakers and officials from renewable energy industry groups had mixed reactions about the significance of the order.

But they do not downplay the effects of the bill that has become law. It is a gutting of incentives from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that will reduce federal government support for renewable energy, electric vehicles and manufacturing of those products and related components. The result, according to reports from Rhodium Group, Princeton University’s REPEAT Project, the think tank Energy Innovation and the Clean Energy Buyers Association, is likely to be a decrease in U.S. jobs and an increase in electricity prices.

And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.

“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email. “To state the obvious, only Congress can change tax law—which, in fact, is what Congress did last week via the budgetary megabill.”

He expects little or no practical effect from the Interior department provision

“It is worth noting that, under the Federal Power Act, the government cannot favor one type of power generation over another,” he said. “Thus, the EO simply restates existing law in that regard.”

Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate for BloombergNEF, sees much greater potential for harm to the wind and solar industries.

“It’s a big deal, but how big a deal it is we don’t know,” he said.

He explained that the order is attempting to create uncertainty around the 2026 deadline, which is a crucial deadline for projects to have a smooth path to qualifying for tax credits.

“It could push a lot of projects out of eligibility or into such an uncertain state of eligibility that it becomes hard to build and finance them,” he said.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, offered this statement:

“This executive order appears to target long-standing and well-established tax standards that allow for realistic financing timelines for all sorts of energy projects—including solar, wind, carbon capture and hydrogen projects,” she said. “We will continue to make the case that business certainty, predictability, and even-handedness are bedrocks of federal policy that cannot be undone by the stroke of a pen. We expect the Treasury Department to follow the law.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois), who has a background running clean energy businesses, said the order is about helping the market for fossil fuels by harming competing sources of electricity.

“Donald Trump doesn’t hate renewable energy because it is clean,” he said in an email. “He hates it because it’s cheap. His latest executive orders are about making it harder for Americans to access cheap and reliable energy to ensure he keeps profits up for his friends in the fossil fuel industry.”

Taylor Rogers, an assistant press secretary for Trump, pushed back on concerns that the president’s actions would lead to higher energy prices.

“No one takes disingenuous cost concerns seriously from ‘clean energy’ groups that supported a $200 billion tax hike on the American people to fund the Green New Scam,” she said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill will continue to unleash America’s energy industry, dropping electricity costs that increased dramatically due to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.”

She listed the many aspects of the bill that increase oil and gas production and reduce regulations, which she said will cut costs for consumers.

Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.

The budget bill passed the House on Friday, 218-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. Several fiscally conservative House members initially balked at the spending levels in the bill, but most of them ended up voting for it after meeting with Trump.

Asked about how Trump had earned their votes, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told CNBC on Friday that the president had told members he would use executive powers to stop renewable energy sources from being able to use subsidies.

“A lot of these subsidies won’t remain in effect from here on out,” Norman said.

He posted on Facebook on Tuesday that the order was “a pledge [Trump] had made, and one he kept.”

He added, “I proudly support an all-of-the-above energy approach—ensuring coal, gas, nuclear, hydropower, and yes, responsibly advanced renewables can compete in an honest market. THIS is how you make energy policy work for everyday Americans, not special interests.”

It’s not much of a stretch to see a connection between Norman’s comment on CNBC and the executive order, said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that works to expand access to rooftop solar.

“I assume that this is the direct response to that promise,” he said.

He said it’s difficult to predict the ramifications of the order without knowing how federal agencies will choose to respond.

“It all depends on how Treasury interprets the guidance. It could be nothing. It could be a lot,” he said.

Brand believes the order’s intent was to increase uncertainty and discourage companies from using the tax credits, which it may succeed in doing even if it doesn’t lead to any substantive changes in the way the credits work.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1455382/story_image/AP23060767877666.jpg?1752268392,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:08.837595

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes.

This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews.","Multiple federal agencies have rolled out new rules for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, as the Trump administration aims to expedite environmental reviews.

However, environmental groups warn the changes could erode the act’s intended purpose and safeguards around government decision making.

NEPA was signed into law in 1970, requiring federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of proposed actions such as issuing development permits, adopting federal land management actions, building highways and publicly-owned facilities and more.

The latest agency changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to ensure “environmental reviews cannot be weaponized to stall the growth of the American economy or halt energy infrastructure construction,” according to a June 30 memo from the White House .

These reforms follow a withdrawal of the Council on Environmental Quality’s authority, as ordered by the executive order to increase domestic energy production. The council, which was created at the same time as NEPA, historically has created a default set of regulations for agencies to adopt or build upon.

In the spring, the council pulled back its authority and rescinded its regulations . While many agencies already had their own NEPA regulations, this wholly shifted the responsibility to individual federal departments.

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes. This includes the U.S. departments of agriculture, commerce, interior, energy, transportation and defense as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

While there are nuances to the rule changes proposed by each of these federal agencies, there are a few through-lines as the agencies comply with recent executive orders, laws and Supreme Court decisions.

This includes deadlines and page limits for environmental reviews meant to expedite NEPA processes and reduce costs, some of which were prescribed through the ​​Fiscal Responsibility Act’s BUILDER Act amendments under the Biden administration in 2023 .

Additional changes around what actions and effects are subject to review lean on the May Supreme Court ruling regarding the proposed 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway narrowed the scope of what environmental impacts an agency is required to analyze under NEPA.

In the case, the plaintiffs (Eagle County and five environmental groups) argued that the review of the railway failed to study downstream impacts such as how increased rail traffic would impact wildfire risk and impacts on water resources and other biological resources.

The Supreme Court ruled that NEPA was “purely procedural” and agencies don’t have to study these up and downstream impacts and put the onus on agencies to determine the scope of analysis required for projects.

Both the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior ‘s interim final rules indicate the changes will get back to NEPA’s procedural roots and make reviews “faster, more flexible and more efficient” as guided by this court decision and other recent regulations and directives including Trump’s domestic energy executive orders, which gave guidance to expedite and simply NEPA processes.

One thing the Department of Agriculture is proposing to increase efficiency is to issue a uniform set of procedures for all agencies under it, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency and four more. The interim rule proposes rescinding all the individual regulations previously held by these agencies.

In a statement , Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the permitting process “has been abused for decades to block affordable, reliable energy production, delay critical infrastructure projects and stunt America’s economy,” lauding the revised NEPA procedures as a fix of the system.

Melissa Simpson, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas trade group that represents Colorado and 12 other Western states, applauded the NEPA changes proposed as a “major step in removing roadblocks and spurring capital investments in American energy and infrastructure.”

Environmental advocates argue NEPA reforms will diminish act, public input

Ronni Flannery, senior staff attorney with The Wilderness Society, said the national environmental nonprofit is still combing through the various proposals, but sees some concerning themes.

“One thing that sort of strikes us is that there’s likely to be a lot of inconsistency in how these various provisions are applied, which means confusion among the regulated parties and just some challenges there,” Flannery said. “It certainly is a significant departure from what has operated as the rules of the game up till this point.”

While The Wilderness Society was supportive of some of the NEPA permitting reforms passed under Biden, other actions by the Trump administration and Republicans have signaled concerns for what the proposals will actually do. Part of this is that the Biden reforms included resource allocations to help agencies conduct NEPA reviews.

“Congress has now revoked resources and dollars that were earmarked for helping the agencies staff up and make sure that their environmental review processes and permitting processes are efficient and so that there’s adequate staffing,” Flannery said, adding that this will make it more difficult for agencies to conduct these environmental reviews.

A 2022 research study , which studied over 41,000 NEPA decisions completed by the U.S. Forest Service — which conducts more environmental impact statements than any other federal agency — between 2004 and 2020, concluded that delays in the permitting process were most often attributed to staff turnover, inadequate budgets, delays in receiving information from applications and more.

The study noted that these statements represent less than 1% of all NEPA decisions, but that data on other decisions is limited.

In addition to these reforms, Republicans included a “pay-to-play” provision for NEPA in Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which was signed into law last week. This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews. (A previous provision that would have also allowed entities paying the fee to avoid any judicial review of projects was removed from the final bill.)

These types of expeditious environmental reviews not only follow the administration’s effort to prioritize profit over people and shut out public input, but erode the protections NEPA offers, Flannery argued.

Already, there have been examples of “projects moving through the process at warp speed,” Flannery said.

This includes the Bureau of Land Management’s decision to expedite review of a proposal to increase oil transport out of the Uinta Basin in Utah — which Colorado lawmakers criticized — as well as a Bureau approved uranium mine expansion in southeast Utah , which was the first project to go forward with Trump’s expedited 14-day environmental review process that excluded public, input.

On the whole, Flannery said that in effect, these reforms and the administration, are “shutting the public out of government decision-making on decisions that impact the public and our national lands and waters.”

Public input, Flannery argued, is a key tenant of the environmental policy, also pointing to a 2025 study from the University of Arizona , which concluded that public comment on environmental impact statements influences outcomes and often results in substantive changes in federal agency decision making.

“NEPA was always intended to ensure that the government takes a close look at the health and environmental impacts of their actions and cumulatively,” Flannery said. “What we’re seeing from the administration and from some acts of Congress, is the severe eroding of these protections and the ability of the public to not only understand what the government is doing, but also to weigh in, express concerns and help influence the process to make sure that communities are protected.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2017/06/04221025/ROAN_1_8-24-1240x854.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:37.705701

One of the key changes for the automotive industry is that the bill eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles. EVs will become more expensive up front. The lease loophole, responsible for shockingly cheap deals on EVs, closes. The Slate pickup's entire business model is under threat. The move may even impact Jeep Wrangler sales; the popular 4xe hybrid model had been eligible for the full $7,500 credit.

Fortunately, if you're in the market for an EV, the federal tax credit is not going away immediately. Buyers can still take advantage of it if they take delivery before Sept. 30, 2025. Several EVs and plug-in hybrids meet the criteria for federal tax credit eligibility. Here are ten that you should consider buying before the tax credit gets eliminated in September.

All on this list are eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit until Sept. 30, 2025. We sourced performance data from manufacturer websites and EV range data from the EPA.

10 Acura ZDX

Acura revived the ZDX nameplate for its first EV. It's a midsize crossover, and like its Honda Prologue sibling, the ZDX runs on GM's Ultium platform that underpins the Chevrolet Blazer EV. It offers up to 500 horsepower, in Type S guise, and up to 313 miles of EV range.

Acura ZDX Specs

The ZDX starts at an MSRP of $64,500 for the rear-wheel-drive base model. The AWD version starts at $68,500, and the Type S begins at $73,500. So, all ZDX trims are currently below the $80,000 threshold to be eligible for the federal tax credit. Tax credits had potentially been pushing the price below that of the Honda CR-V hybrid.

9 Cadillac Lyriq

The Lyriq is Cadillac's first fully electric vehicle. It's a midsize crossover, and like the Acura above, it also uses the GM Ultium platform. The Lyriq offers up to 326 miles of range in single-motor and 319 miles of range in dual-motor AWD form. Buyers can level up to a 500 horsepower version.

Cadillac Lyriq Specs

The Lyriq has been a strong seller for Cadillac, thanks in part to the federal tax credit. All Lyriq trims are currently eligible for this, but it's not the only Caddy, as the new new three-row Visitiq crossover also squeezes in below the threshold in it's base configuration.

8 Chevy Equinox EV

The Chevrolet Equinox EV is not the sexiest electric vehicle on the market, but the compact crossover does deliver perhaps the best range for dollar spent value offer in the affordable realm. The Equinox offers 319 miles of EV range, which is impressive for a base trim starting at $33,600.

Chevrolet Equinox EV Specs

The Equinox EV is eligible to receive the full $7,500 federal tax credit. That can bring the base price down to an effective $26,100, bringing every Equinox EV trim below $40,000. The tax credit has also helped Chevrolet offer affordable, sub-$300/month lease deals. The federal tax credit also affects the Blazer EV and certain Silverado EV configurations.

7 Ford F-150 Lightning

The Ford F-150 pickup is America's most popular vehicle, so the automaker wanted to recreate that in the electric realm. Thus, the Blue Oval released the F-150 Lightning, which is, quite literally, an F-150 that happens to be electric. It offers up to 580 hp, 775 lb-ft of torque, and 320 miles of range with the Extended Range battery. It can also serve as a backup generator for your home, thoughthis does require a pricey home power setup.

Ford F-150 Lightning Specs

The F-150 Lightning starts at $54,780. However, buyers must upgrade to the $69,995 Flash trim to get an extended-range battery pack. All F-150 Lightning trims below Platinum are eligible for the federal tax credit, and Ford has been relaying that full credit to customers to bring the F-150 Lightning's costs down.

6 Genesis Electrified GV70

The Genesis Electrified GV70 isn't the most elegant name for an EV, or any car really. But if you can overlook that, it's a seriously impressive package. It resembles the standard GV70, especially since there is EV badging, but it does feature a faux grille. Although it rides on a different platform, it still utilizes the same electric motors and 350 kW fast-charging technology found in other Hyundai group EVs. It packs 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and that's before you send it into boost mode.

Genesis Electrified GV70 Specs

The Electrified GV70 starts at $64,380 MSRP with the base AWD trim. Buyers can level up to the Prestige AWD for $75,350. All trims are eligible for the federal tax credit, which keeps the base MSRP under $60,000.

5 Honda Prologue

We've already mentioned the Honda Prologue, so you might remember that it is a midsize electric crossover that rides on GM's Ultium crossover platform. The Prologue borrows some design language from the Civic. It has dramatically less power, though, topping out at 288 hp in AWD spec, but it can deliver up to 308 miles of range in FWD form.

Honda Prologue Specs

The Prologue starts at $47,400 and tops out with the $57,900 Elite trim. So, all versions are eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. Affordability has been a key part of the EV's appeal, as it can bring the effective cost of even the most expensive Prologue trims under $55,000.

4 Hyundai Ioniq 5

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a former World Car of the Year Award winner and one of the best all-around EVs on the market, with a combination of style, practicality, and advanced EV tech. The 2025 refresh introduces a larger 84-kWh battery pack, offering up to 318 miles of range in RWD and 290 miles in AWD, along with helpful additions such as a rear wiper. And it can deliver up to 641 hp in bursts with the Ioniq 5 N version.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 Specs

The Ioniq 5 starts at $42,600 for the SE Standard Range base model. However, most buyers will opt for the $46,650 SE version with the larger battery pack. The federal tax credit, eligible for all Ioniq 5 trims, can push the base price below $40,000. Hyundai has also been using the credit to offer affordable lease deals.

3 Kia EV6

The Kia EV6 shares the E-GMP platform and electric motors with the Ioniq 5. Kia opted for a sleek and sporty style over a retro-futuristic one, so the EV6 is a bit more wagon-like in its design than the Ioniq 5's hatchback shape. The EV6 offers up to 319 miles of range in RWD and 295 miles in AWD. The 577-hp EV6 GT can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds.

Kia EV6 Specs

The EV6 starts at $42,900. Trims range up to $63,800 for the EV6 GT model. All trims are eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, which can bring the base price to $35,400. Kia has been using the federal tax credit to pass on outstanding lease deals to customers as part of a bid to boost sales.

2 Kia EV9

The EV market needed an affordable, three-row family crossover, and Kia delivered it with the World Car of the Year Award-winning EV9. This model delivers stately and rugged style, performance (up to 379 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque), and the Hyundai E-GMP platform's class-leading charging tech. It can seat up to seven passengers or offer more than 80 cubic feet of cargo space. Kia is set to level things up even further with the EV9 GT.

Kia EV9 Specs

The Kia EV9 starts at $54,900 MSRP, which can be pushed below $50,000 using the federal tax credit. Kia has also been using the federal tax credit to offer affordable EV9 lease deals.

1 Tesla Model Y

The Model Y is Tesla's smaller crossover. It offers the same combination of range (up to 357 miles), style, and affordability as the Model 3, but in the crossover body style that most buyers prefer. And it has become the best-selling Tesla and best-selling EV by a wide margin. It was America's fourth best-selling overall vehicle in 2024, with more than 400,000 units sold. And it just received an overhaul for 2025.

Tesla Model Y Specs

Tesla has used the federal tax credit to keep the Model Y very affordable. The starting price currently sits at $44,900 MSRP for the RWD model and $48,900 for the AWD model. This brings both cars under $42,000 with the federal tax credit factored in. Every Tesla Model 3 and non-Cyberbeast Cybertruck is potentially eligible for the federal tax credit.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10-evs-you-should-buy-before-trump-s-big-beautiful-bill-comes-into-effect.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:11.028297
,EPA,2025-07-13 15:03:22+00:00,Inside Climate News,Baltimore's Wetlands Restoration Pushes Ahead Despite Federal Funding Setbacks,"Aman Azhar, Sarah Mattalian",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13072025/baltimore-wetlands-restoration-federal-funding-setbacks/,"The development in the last couple of years has been unrelenting, spurring the wave of gentrification that now defines this part of South Baltimore.
It’s not part of the planned wetlands or other investments the city and its implementing partners are pouring into the rest of South Baltimore.
One of those critics is Nicole Fabricant, an anthropology professor from Towson State University and environmental activist working in South Baltimore.
“The toxicity in South Baltimore has to do with the overburden of industries down there.
But they also do not deserve it less than Curtis Bay,” Rogers said.","BALTIMORE—Gravel crunched underfoot as Brad Rogers and Andrew Forbes stepped onto a narrow strip carved along a portion of the Patapsco River shoreline that’s slated to be a 9-acre tidal wetland.

At the site, just south of the Hanover Street Bridge, crews had been at work since last September, constructing a gravel sill that would hold new grasses. A muddy platform wound its way farther into the river, its edges blurring against the waves shimmering in the distance.

It’s just one small part of a multimillion dollar initiative jointly implemented by South Baltimore Gateway Partnership, a nonprofit led by Rogers, and its partner environmental engineering firm, Greenvest, where Forbes is a senior project manager.

Rogers slowed to observe the scene.

“When we were out here this morning, literally three hours ago, the tide was higher and this whole area was flooded—everywhere that looks like puddles now was ankle- or chin-deep water,” he said. “The gap in the breakwater allows water to flood in and out, and that sort of flushing connects what happens here with the Bay—fish, microorganisms and protein all exchanging between the wetland and open water.”

This stretch of shoreline along Hanover Street is one of four major sites under the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, a massive project aiming to breathe ecological life back into a river battered by decades of industrialization, stormwater runoff and urban neglect. When completed, the Hanover Street site will have low and high marshes and intertidal mudflats designed to absorb tidal surges, stabilize the shoreline and provide refuge to wildlife.

Rogers says the ecosystem is already attracting native species.

“The first thing I see is a beautiful great blue heron wading through a tidal pool we just finished building,” Rogers recalled. “We had just put the sand out, just planted the grasses. The water flooded in, and that heron—it just knew it was home. To one side was a snowy egret fishing, to the other, Canada geese with goslings nibbling in the grass.”

Only a year ago, the site was choked with trash and thick tangles of non-native plant species. Now, dead trees salvaged through the city’s Camp Small debris reuse program serve as perches for birds and carbon-rich habitat for organisms further down the food chain.

Construction began in the middle of last year with a stone sill snaking out roughly 150 to 200 feet from the shore into the Patapsco. Forbes and his team filled the interior with layers of sand and organic matter, a task made difficult by centuries of sedimentation at the river’s mouth. “The sub-base here is soft,” Forbes said. “You need more stone and sand than you think because it sinks. A lot of it disappears beneath the surface to create stability. You can’t see it, but it’s there, doing the work.”

But this spring, just as the marsh was beginning to take shape, a letter arrived. It was from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“The notification itself was very curt: There will not be money for the construction phase. No guidance, no next steps, just very factual. No explanation,” Rogers recalled.

Rogers’ nonprofit was originally awarded $32 million for wetlands restoration through FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a major climate resilience funding mechanism launched during the Biden administration. But in April, the Trump administration abruptly terminated BRIC, calling it a “wasteful, politicized grant program” in an official statement.

For Rogers, the sudden clawback could have delivered a major blow to the entire Middle Branch initiative. But his organization has been able to receive funding from multiple sources.

“We’ve built a program that goes beyond any one project. And having secured the BRIC grant brought us credibility to pull together a robust pipeline of multiple different avenues for raising capital funds,” Rogers said. “That grant provided a significant amount of credibility that accelerated our ability to grow the program.”

By Rogers’ estimate, the Hanover wetlands will be 90 percent complete by late summer. “All of these pieces are beginning to come together, and by the end of the summer, it’ll be 90 percent of the way there, and we’ll call the project done. And then a year later, the plants will be that much more grown in, and before you know it, it’ll just look like a giant natural system that’s always been there,” he said.

As he and Forbes walked back toward the exit, Rogers paused again near the new plantings. “This used to be a dumping ground,” he said. “Now, it’s becoming a refuge.”

Weathering FEMA’s Pullback

Brad Rogers remembers the moment clearly. He had already secured the funding. Years of planning and coalition-building were finally yielding results. Then the email came. FEMA was rescinding $26 million of the $32 million it had awarded his organization.

The BRIC cuts didn’t just affect his nonprofit—they impacted nearly a billion dollars’ worth of flood prevention and climate resilience projects across the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” the agency said in a statement announcing the cuts.

Of the $1 billion provided to BRIC under the 2021 Infrastructure and Jobs Act, around $882 million will be returned to the U.S. Treasury or reapportioned by Congress in the next fiscal year, according to the agency’s plans. Trump administration officials noted that their predecessors disbursed $133 million to about 450 applicants since the establishment of the grant program, according to the statement.

FEMA did not respond to multiple requests for comments about the rescinded funds and the likely impact an abrupt withdrawal of federal support will have on the projects already underway throughout Maryland and elsewhere in the country.

In Maryland, the cancellation affected dozens of planned upgrades to stormwater systems, shoreline protections and ecological buffer zones in vulnerable communities. Local governments were left scrambling to identify replacement funds.

“There are many organizations and governments across the country which are in far worse conditions than we are,” Rogers said. “I try to be respectful of the difference between what other people are facing and what we are.”

Rogers credited his nonprofit’s resilience to its structure—a unique hybrid of public and nonprofit actors—and its ability to forge alliances quickly.

The BRIC clawbacks hit Maryland’s small towns particularly hard. Crisfield, a low-lying city on the Eastern Shore, lost key funding for long-awaited stormwater upgrades and a planned flood barrier meant to shield the town from chronic flooding. The project, a key element of Crisfield’s Southern Flood Mitigation Plan, was years in the making and is now on hold.

In Baltimore City and across the county, sewer rehabilitation projects designed to reduce flooding and backups have been paused. Plans to invest in green infrastructure in historically neglected neighborhoods have similarly stalled.

Overall, the loss of funds has reverberated across rural towns and urban centers statewide. In places like Crisfield, where tax bases are small and adaptation plans depend on outside dollars, the absence of federal support has left little room to maneuver. In cities, climate and public health goals are impacted, forcing leaders to prioritize short-term goals over longer-term resilience projects.

FEMA’s decision has left communities scrambling for alternatives, as extreme weather events take a toll across Maryland and sea level rise threatens the gains made after decades of investments in restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

Rogers found it ironic that funds meant for resilience got pulled at a time when climate change and extreme weather events are making those investments all the more important.

Despite the loss, new support came from the state of Maryland, local agencies and private philanthropies. Smaller grants were put together. Some projects were scaled back. But the work continued.

Rogers felt that walking away from South Baltimore’s disinvested neighborhoods like Cherry Hill and Westport when the going got tough was not an option. It was important to show up, he said, even when it’s hard.

Reconnecting the River

A few hundred feet across the Hanover Street Bridge, traffic zipped past with the usual urgency of a weekday afternoon.

Rogers and Forbes stood still at the curb momentarily, scanning the oncoming traffic before crossing. On the other side, a narrow passage gave way to a shrubby clearing. Shoulder-high weeds brushed their sleeves as they pushed through, arriving suddenly into a wide, barren field plowed by heavy equipment.

This was Patapsco Delta East, Rogers said, the second wetlands site under construction as part of the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative. Unlike the gentle feel of the Hanover Street project, this site was defined by blunt force.

Excavators punctured the humid air, lifting tangled mats of mud and debris and dumping them to the side. A heap of dead reeds, storm-battered logs and trash sat exposed on one side of the landscape. The smell of earth and diesel came through in waves.

“This whole area used to be one giant mat of phragmites,” Rogers said of the invasive reeds, pointing toward the center of the site, where crews had begun carving a long, curving channel through the wetland base. “Invasive species choked the entire area and made it completely inaccessible.”

Here, between Hanover Street and Potee Street, was this stretch of land, left behind as a sort of ecological dead zone decades ago when overpasses were built around it. “There was no interaction between this site and the river,” Rogers explained. “So you have fish going up and down the river that have no access to the wetland over here that impaired its ecological function.”

That’s starting to change.

The team had been sculpting what Rogers called a “tidal gut”—a winding, sinewy channel meant to reintroduce the daily tidal flows from the Patapsco into the site. “It moves like a snake,” he said, adding that this design allows the tidal channel to naturally connect the restored wetland with the river, enabling water, fish and nutrients to flow in and out with the tides.

The regular exchange also brings in microorganisms and nutrients, creating a dynamic ecosystem that’s constantly refreshed by the Bay’s waters.

By planting new marshes and opening water channels to reconnect the ecosystem, the project aims to restore more than 12 acres of impaired land to the Middle Branch tidal system. “Instead of dumping more soil, like we did across the bridge, here we’re excavating,” Rogers said. “We’re removing the disconnect. That’s the work.”

Construction at the site broke ground in late February, just weeks before FEMA rescinded climate infrastructure funding. Though the Delta East site survived the cut, in part because construction on it had already begun, the clawback did affect the broader project. Designs for a fourth site, farther along the river’s bend, didn’t make it beyond the planning phase.

The MedStar Harbor Hospital site to the north will be the third major wetland restoration under the initiative and is due to break ground later this year. While each site differs in many ways, they fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle: one extending into the river, another carved back into land, the third reclaiming industrial fill.

The Road Ahead

After leaving Forbes, Rogers drove past the edge of the cleared wetland, now behind metal fencing, and headed north toward the Baltimore Peninsula. In the distance, tower cranes dotted the skyline.

New apartment complexes came into view alongside the shimmering waterfront and the global headquarters of the activewear brand Under Armour. The development in the last couple of years has been unrelenting, spurring the wave of gentrification that now defines this part of South Baltimore.

But not every neighborhood has seen similar growth. Curtis Bay, for instance, a working-class community on the city’s southern edge, sits isolated from these developments. There, residents live next to coal terminals and chemical tanks.

The neighborhood shares the same Patapsco shoreline that remains vulnerable to storm surge and has eroded during decades of disinvestment. It’s not part of the planned wetlands or other investments the city and its implementing partners are pouring into the rest of South Baltimore.

The question of whether Curtis Bay should develop as an industrial zone, as some city authorities have previously suggested, or thrive as a residential community has eclipsed its development. Residents and local community groups have long urged officials to enforce stricter environmental controls to mitigate toxic pollution and invest in civic amenities. But the tension has resulted in lost opportunities, advocates believe.

As Inside Climate News previously reported, communities across South Baltimore have also questioned whether the city’s environmental restoration projects—however ecologically beneficial—also reinforce existing inequities by concentrating benefits where capital investment is already flowing. Despite its habitat gains, some critics feel the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative aligns too comfortably with real estate timelines and branding efforts surrounding the waterfront redevelopment.

One of those critics is Nicole Fabricant, an anthropology professor from Towson State University and environmental activist working in South Baltimore. She believes that the problems in neighborhoods like Curtis Bay and Cherry Hill stem from the legacy industries, including coal piers and the giant incinerator that burns much of the city’s trash.

“I’m always skeptical of some of these shiny projects that often extract from the poor and benefit the wealthy. It’s like a quick-fit techno solution to deeply structural problems,” Fabricant said. “If instead we actually held corporate polluters accountable, and enforced some of the environmental regulations at the state level, we would see much cleaner, healthier environments.”

Fabricant said projects like shoreline improvements are attractive to public and private funders because they avoid going after corporate polluters, which is where the problem lies, in her opinion.

“The toxicity in South Baltimore has to do with the overburden of industries down there. But a lot of these bigger environmental projects are not willing to take on big polluters or to really identify the corporate entities that benefit from cheap lands and demobilize communities,” she said. “Until we actually enforce those environmental regulations, we’ll continue to see these techno quick fixes that aren’t really addressing the root problems.”

In the end, she said, a project like the Middle Branch Initiative, designed to restore the natural world lost to decades of industrialization, is unable to reconnect the Black communities in places like Curtis Bay because its very design prevents it from doing so. That, critics like Fabricant say, is one of its biggest weaknesses: a structural limitation that risks deepening the very inequities it aims to heal.

Rogers is aware of the criticism.

He said that while Curtis Bay is a part of South Baltimore and touches the Patapsco River, it is not adjacent to the Middle Branch and is outside the remit of their work. “This is the difficult reality: reimagining 11 miles of shoreline is incredibly ambitious and difficult, but it also doesn’t resolve all the problems faced across South Baltimore,” he said.

Rogers said he understood the concern that the initiative might only restore environmental quality for people who can afford to live in gentrifying areas where the people the project purports to serve once lived. “These are legitimate worries, and we should always be attentive to them,” he said, adding that the two ongoing projects and the one waiting to break ground at MedStar Harbor Hospital will benefit the Brooklyn and Cherry Hill neighborhoods, home to low-income Black and brown communities with limited shoreline access.

“Cherry Hill and Brooklyn do not deserve environmental quality and resiliency more than Curtis Bay. But they also do not deserve it less than Curtis Bay,” Rogers said.

For disinvested neighborhoods like Curtis Bay, which is not served by the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, the abrupt cut in federal funding has made a bad situation worse. Since FEMA pulled the plug on BRIC grants and similar uncertainty surrounds the promised funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, smaller community nonprofits and well-funded groups like Rogers’ alike are left to navigate a rapidly changing funding landscape.

But there’s opportunity in every crisis. Rogers’ nonprofit just secured new funding from the Maryland Department of the Environment—$17 million in total—through the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund and the Comprehensive Flood Management Program.

The infusion, he said, reinforces his belief that the Middle Branch strategy can align multiple priorities at once: flood protection, habitat renewal and water quality. “We sit at this interesting nexus point between resiliency, restoration, recreation, water quality and habitat. Depending on the site and the funder’s goals, we’re able to mix and match and tap into multiple simultaneous funding streams,” he said.

As he drove past the new townhomes along Cromwell Street, Rogers pointed out another reality.

“Many people who are well educated in environmental science or climate science may be able to talk for hours about carbon sequestration, but wouldn’t know what to do with an excavator,” Rogers said. “You really need to have a team that brings together all of those disciplines—estimating costs, designing, permitting and building the project. Those are essential components of being effective in the world.”

It’s a perspective he’s come to appreciate over years in the nonprofit sector—one shaped less by idealism and more by implementation. “Our state and local partners have been more interested in figuring out opportunities for collaboration than they even were in the past,” he continued, “because now they know that their budgets are going to be tighter, and so they have to think creatively about how to find new partners.”

While Rogers’ organization has weathered the first round of cuts, the broader picture remains fuzzy. Many community-scale nonprofits—especially those without in-house technical staff, grant writers or political access—are still left to ponder the fate of their canceled plans.

As he parked the car outside his office, Rogers glanced at his phone, already vibrating with a new string of messages. He exhaled, shifted the gear into park, and looked up once more toward the shimmering shoreline visible in the distance.

“It’s not easy,” he said. “But I’m glad it’s coming together.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Library-4-of-11-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:46.863582

Local residents are demanding better communication and transparency from the refinery.

The coalition is requesting a community meeting, an alert system, a 24/7 contact number, regular monitoring data reports, and neighborhood air quality monitors.

El Pasoans were left with little to no answers as huge black plumes of smoke overtook the city and flames burst through smokestacks at the Marathon Refinery in South Central.

""We deserve to know what is going on at the refinery,"" said Matthew Moriel, who lives in the Corbin-Sambrano neighborhood a few blocks from the refinery. ""We need to know if we need to be indoors and whether we need to turn off our swamp coolers to keep the polluted air from coming inside. It is unacceptable for a refinery in the middle of the city to be unreachable by those who live closest to its pollution.""

Large plumes of black smoke and flames started coming out of smokestacks from Marathon Refinery, located at 212 North Clark Drive near Alameda Avenue, about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 8.

Moriel and other neighbors began calling the refinery for information on what was happening at the plant, but only heard from a security guard, who took a message. The neighbors never heard back from the refinery operators.

In an unnamed emailed statement, a Marathon Petroleum Corp. spokesperson told the El Paso Times the incident was caused by a power outage.

""Due to a power outage from a third-party provider on July 8, operating conditions at Marathon’s El Paso refinery made flaring necessary,"" the statement said. ""Flares are safety devices that allow for the safe combustion of excess gases during certain operating conditions.""

The company reported no injuries during the incident or harmful environmental impact on the area.

""Air monitoring was deployed as a precaution, and no off-site impacts were detected,"" the statement said.

Community asking for transparency, better communication

Houston in Action’s Sembrando Esperanza Coalition, a group led ""by residents of 11 of the most historic, resilient, polluted, and hottest working class neighborhoods in El Paso County,"" is asking for more transparency and communication from Marathon Refinery leaders, a news release from the coalition said.

“Even if what happened (July 8) does not result in a violation of state or federal rules, it does not mean the fumes were not toxic and dangerous to our health, environment and pets,"" Sembrando Esperanza Coalition's Climate Justice and Civil Rights organizer Veronica Carbajal said. ""Further, we won’t know what was in the fumes or how it affected our air quality until the monitoring data is released. In the meantime, nearby residents deserve to know what precautions to take and who to call in such emergencies.”

The group is asking for Marathon Refinery to:

Host a meeting for neighbors to attend and discuss their concerns

Create an alert system for neighbors close to the refinery

Provide neighbors a number they can call 24/7 and speak with a human being every time neighbors see, hear or smell something out of the ordinary

Regular reports of the monitoring data

Air quality monitors to be placed in the neighborhood, including those that read the carcinogens released by the refinery

Marathon Refinery officials said they already have policies in place to alert residents to any dangers.

""The safety of workers, our neighbors, and the environment is our top priority,"" Marathon Refinery's statement said. ""If a situation potentially requires action by members of the community, we advise designated local authorities, following pre-established frameworks, and then work with those authorities, media and others to convey information to the community as needed.""

What is flaring?

The El Paso refinery ""processes sweet and sour crude oils into gasoline, distillates, heavy fuel oil, propane, asphalt, and NGLs (Natural Gas Liquids) and petrochemicals,"" according to an annual report by the company.

Flaring is the process of burning off excess or waste gases that cannot be processed or reused, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Flaring safely releases excess pressure from refinery equipment, especially during emergencies or maintenance.

Flaring can release harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, a study published in the Science research journal. The pollutants released by flaring can lead to health issues like asthma, heart attacks, and premature deaths, particularly in communities near refineries, the study states.

Data on the types and quantities of pollutants released during the El Paso Marathon Refinery's flaring have not been released.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time could also claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S.-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which are all headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 13:08:00.901041

This reflects its role as the world’s manufacturing hub, with heavy reliance on coal and high industrial output.

In fact, China’s share of global manufacturing is also about the same (27%) showing the direct consequence of becoming the world’s production base.

The country has committed to peaking emissions before 2030, but its growth trajectory poses challenges.

This also means any progress on climate will hinge heavily both on China’s policy decisions and global consumer behavior.

U.S. and India Round Out the Top Three Carbon Emissions

The U.S. is the second-largest emitter at 6.0 GtCO₂e (11.3% of global emissions).

And this is with around 330 million people, or one-fourth of China’s population. It’s per capita emissions (15 tCO₂e) is also top-15 in the world.

In stark contrast, India ranks third with 4.1 GtCO₂e (7.8%), lower than the U.S., with four times the number of people. However, its emissions are rising as its economy and population grow, following a similar path Western industrialized countries took to prosperity.

Smaller Countries with Outsized Carbon Emissions

Nations like Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Canada appear further down the list, but have some of the highest per capita emissions globally.

Their rankings reflect both resource-driven economies and energy-intensive lifestyles.

Meanwhile, countries like Brazil and Indonesia have large emissions tied to economic development, deforestation, and land use.

Honda wants to bring it to market around the world, and it could make the perfect replacement for the already-missed Honda e. One that might be a lot easier to sell than that tech-heavy electric. Now we've finally gotten up close and personal with the Super Honda.

Super EV's First In-Person Appearance

Our first look at the Super EV came a month ago. Honda launched a teaser campaign for the vehicles it planned to bring to Goodwood, and while the robot lawnmower and the production Prelude were neat, it was the tiny purple box in front of the Palace of Westminster that really grabbed our eyeballs.

Yes, it's just another tiny electric city car. There's only so much an automaker can do with that footprint, but somehow Honda has given this a load of character. Even though we can't even really see the bodywork, this little car screams fun. Well, more like shouts fun quietly but adorably.

Honda called it an ""all-electric urban concept vehicle."" Now it is saying the car ""realizes both practical usability and the 'joy of driving' only Honda can offer.""

Check out those TE37s. This is proof positive that the design works on anything, at least anything built after about 1975. They're a 16-inch size, which is delightfully compact. No, we don't think a production car will use this wheel, but we can dream, right?

Funky Design, Affordable Features

Up close, the Super EV looks just as adorable and funky as it did in Honda's shots. We can see more of it now, too, including just how boxy those arches are, the cuts in the doorlines, and the Honda badge in the nose. Honda is hiding the interior away from us, sadly, but that's probably because it's an early prototype.

Honda's also hiding many of the details, but we did manage to get them to admit it's front-wheel drive with a single electric motor, will be a direct successor to the Honda e, and will be far more affordable. Things like the conventional door mirrors are key in achieving that affordable price point, although the exact figure Honda is targeting is still a secret.

Why does Honda think this one could work when the Honda e couldn't? This car looks like it will be more cost-effective than the e. While that other Honda was another adorable electric, it was loaded with high-tech and expensive goodies. Cameras instead of side mirrors, for example, and screens that ran from pillar to pillar inside the cabin. And yes, those are rear drum brakes. On a car this size, it doesn't matter. Regen does most of the work, and drums are cheaper. Even some Audi EV models that cost tens of thousands more have rear drums for exactly those reasons.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/honda-super-ev-concept-goodwood-3.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:35.539924

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.
This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.
In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects.
“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright has heard a lot of doomsday predictions about the rollback of wind and solar subsidies in President Trump’s sweeping tax cut bill.

He has one simple answer: “They’re just wrong.”

Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive with roots in solar and geothermal, said intermittent renewables are a costly impediment on the nation’s electrical grid, and the sooner they are replaced by reliable sources such as natural gas, coal or nuclear, the faster costs will come down.

“If you look at the places that have spent the most subsidies and built the largest amount of wind and solar, the more cheap energy you put on our grid, the more expensive the grid becomes,” Mr. Wright said in an interview with The Washington Times.

The cost of cutting taxes in Mr. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill is paid for in part by axing a slate of subsidies for green energy projects, including wind and solar, by 2026.

The elimination of the renewable subsidies, the Joint Committee on Taxation determined, will save nearly $500 billion over ten years.

But opponents warn it will kill jobs, hike energy bills and ultimately weaken the power grid by discouraging future wind and solar projects, which will slow the growth of grid capacity as demand rises. Or, they warn, solar and wind projects will move ahead but at a higher, unsubsidized cost that will be passed along to ratepayers.

Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the tax subsidies, called the cuts “an outright massacre” for wind and solar.

“Not only will hundreds of thousands of Americans who work in clean energy lose their jobs right away, individual families and businesses of all sizes nationwide will get clobbered with higher utility bills,” the Oregon Democrat said.

The media coverage has been overwhelmingly dire, honing in on states like Minnesota, which have invested heavily in wind and solar projects, and turning to clean energy advocates for assessments on how these states will be impacted by the cuts.

San Francisco-based Energy Innovation, which advocates for ending fossil fuels, calculated that subsidy cuts would increase annual energy bills in Minnesota households by $6 billion between 2025 and 2034.

“This is due to higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices,” the organization wrote in an analysis of the legislation.

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.

Natural gas, he said, “is just by far and away, the cheapest source of electricity today.”

California, for example, ditched coal and natural gas for wind and solar, and imports its renewable power from Utah and Nevada, among other states. Florida went in the opposite direction, investing in the construction of natural gas pipelines.

“California’s electricity prices today are twice as high as Florida’s. California has by far the largest population of any state in the country. They produce less electricity than Florida does,” said the energy secretary.

On average, the cost of onshore wind and solar is cheaper than fossil fuels, but they only produce power some of the time and require nuclear, coal and natural gas to rev up at night, when it’s cloudy or when the wind is not blowing. This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.

Wind turbines and solar arrays take up more land than non-renewable energy plants and require new transmission lines.

“You really have to maintain two grids,” Mr. Wright said. “When it’s the middle of the day, when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, all the other plants have to turn down to accommodate the wind and sun. Then they’ve got to be turned back up. And that is not an efficient way to run huge machinery. You have to operate your existing grid less efficiently than before, and you have to pay for a second grid.”

Mr. Wright said the tax cut legislation will steer states away from adding renewables to the grid and drive them to build reliable sources that run all the time.

“You still have the ability to generate electricity in all these states. They’re just not going to keep adding to that secondary, parasitic, more expensive grid,” he said.

In Minnesota, subsidized costs of wind and solar climbed even after passage of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which implemented many of the tax credits for new renewable projects now targeted for elimination in Mr. Trump’s bill.

More than a third of the state’s energy is produced by renewables. A state law requires utilities to produce 100% of their electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2040.

The Center of the American Experiment, a conservative think tank in Minnesota, found that rising wind and solar prices have made them the most expensive sources of electricity in the state “by a substantial margin.”

It calculated that electricity produced by new wind projects costs twice as much as electricity from existing coal plants.

The cost of electricity from new solar projects in the state was triple the cost generated by existing coal plants, the group found. It blamed rising prices for wind turbines and solar panels.

Many states have shifted to renewables to reduce emissions and convert to clean energy produced by solar and wind.

In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law in 2022 mandating that the state achieve a zero-carbon electrical grid by 2040.

The ambitious plan is blamed in part for the state’s skyrocketing energy bills, although green energy groups say the real blame lies with global warming, which they say has caused extreme weather events and ultra-hot summers.

Mr. Wright said Mr. Trump’s January executive order blocking most new offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard will spare Connecticut ratepayers even higher utility bills in the future.

Offshore wind is one of the most expensive forms of energy on the planet, he said.

Connecticut energy bills are among the highest in the nation and were expected to increase when the offshore wind projects went online. Eversource, a main provider of power in New England, projected offshore wind would cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, which is almost double the cost of energy provided by the state’s Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.

“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.

Mr. Wright said the high energy costs in the northeast will be reduced by the Trump administration’s revival of a natural gas pipeline project extending from the Marcellus Shale gas fields in northern Pennsylvania to New York and into markets in New England, where consumers pay the highest electricity rates in the nation.

“New England has expensive energy for choices, and the biggest choice they’ve made is just to not have enough connection to the natural gas pipeline network,” he said.

Critics warn that if states abandon solar and wind for natural gas, it would take several years for the permitting and construction of new natural gas plants and much longer to build nuclear power plants. This could leave electrical grids without enough energy and consumers on the hook for higher prices.

Mr. Wright said states will have to change regulations to allow for the expansion of natural gas, which could happen faster now that subsidies for wind and solar are headed for a quick phase-out under the new tax cut law and Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

“Ultimately, if they don’t build all the offshore wind and all that, you’ll probably see an expansion in natural gas-generated electricity,” he said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/02/Alaska_Trump_Energy_Oil_Field_Tour_13733_c0-207-4964-3102_s1200x700.jpg?05818a1aae4a18625e6d2f3787522970c4e058bd,N,,2025-07-13 11:18:45.020922

Projections are going out at least 3 years. It takes on average, like 2 years to design and build an assembly line. That's if there's an existing facility, and that's still a very optimistic timeline.

If you have to build one then it's way longer. All this chaos is costing us jobs. Companies that don't feel safe to invest are canceling programs due to uncertainty. Then they're laying people off due to lack of work.

President cheetoh mussolini is setting us back by decades. The only thing saving the US auto industry rigjt now is the tarriffs on Chinese EVs. If it weren't for them the big 3 would be toast.

EVs are priced taking the tax credit into account, and with huge margins in comparison to ICE cars, so I wouldn't be surprised if out the door prices end up being more or less the same after the credit goes away. The cost of LFP batteries is projected to drop to $50 a kwh by the end of 2025, which means EVs will hit manufacturing cost parity with ICE cars.

EV sales are continuing to grow year over year in the US. People who have EV’s in general have said they will never go back to a gas car. As more people get experience with EV’s more people will realize the perceived issues with charging and range anxiety are unfounded.

When more affordable options become available the EV market will continue to rise at a quick rate.

they're still increasing every year.

Also tired of the myth that most EV user are hanging out waiting for their car to charged. It almost universally comes from a ICE driver who never tried an EV. I'll admit EVs still have a ways to go for apartment dwellers or people without access to overnight or work charging, but for many homeowners, we spend less time at charging stations than you spend at the gas station.

Here's a scenario. I used to fill up 1-2x per week in my ATS. I drove a lot, about 20k a year. I recently got an EV. I upped my driving even more and now i'm driving 24k a year. In one entire year, i spent 18 minutes total at supercharger stations. The rest was simply plugging my car in while it sit and while i sleep in my driveway. I think homeowners(or anyone with easy access to overnight charging) should think of it this way, ""If i left every morning with 3/4 tank, how often would I need to visit the gas station"". For me the answer to that was 2x the whole year. I imagine for most people that would be between 4-8x per year.

A lot of ICE owners try to think of things like you need to go out of your way to charge and you need to wait until you're empty to start charging, but you don't charge like that

EVs were taking off and the infrastructure was coming very soon at the previous rate.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:32.298693

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency.","The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) revolution hinges on one critical factor: domestic control of critical minerals like lithium. Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass Project in Nevada is now the linchpin of this ambition, combining secured funding, strategic partnerships, and federal incentives to position the U.S. as a self-sufficient player in the lithium supply chain. With construction ramping up and a 2027 operational target, investors are presented with a rare opportunity to profit from the intersection of energy independence, EV demand, and geopolitical risk mitigation.

The Funding Firewall: DOE Loans and Private Investments Secure the Supply Chain

Thacker Pass is no longer a speculative project—it is a fully funded, shovel-ready juggernaut. The $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), approved under the Biden administration's Critical Mineral Strategy, will see its first draw in Q3 2025, with the remaining funds staged to cover construction through 2027. This public backing is paired with a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners, which closed in April 2025, and a $100 million cash infusion from General Motors (GM). Together, these moves have created a funding “firewall” to shield the project from market volatility and geopolitical disruptions.

The DOE's involvement is particularly critical. The loan includes terms requiring domestic content for equipment and labor, directly aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. Lithium Americas' focus on local jobs—2,000 direct construction roles—and partnerships with the North America Building Trades Unions ensure compliance while bolstering U.S. manufacturing ecosystems.

GM's Stake: A Direct Pipeline to EV Demand

GM's 38% equity stake in Thacker Pass is more than a financial bet—it's a strategic play for EV supply chain dominance. The automaker has secured a 20-year offtake agreement for 100% of Phase 1's 40,000-tonne lithium carbonate output, enough to power 800,000 EVs annually. This partnership eliminates middlemen, reducing costs by 15-20% compared to spot-market lithium procurement.

For investors, GM's involvement is a guarantee of demand. As EV sales grow at a 25%+ CAGR through 2030, Thacker Pass's production will directly feed into GM's battery factories (e.g., Ultium Cells' $7 billion investment in Ohio). This symbiosis positions Lithium Americas as a de-risked play on EV adoption, insulated from lithium price swings through long-term pricing agreements.

The IRA Multiplier Effect: Tax Credits and Geopolitical Risk Mitigation

The Inflation Reduction Act's $30 billion in clean energy incentives supercharges Thacker Pass's value. Lithium Americas qualifies for IRA credits tied to domestic production, including:

- 40% investment tax credit for facilities using union labor and local materials.

- Battery credits for EVs using U.S.-sourced lithium, which could add $1,500–$7,500 per vehicle in subsidies for GM.

These incentives create a virtuous cycle: Thacker Pass's lithium enables U.S.-made EVs to claim IRA credits, while the IRA's tax breaks lower project costs. Meanwhile, the project's proximity to Nevada's “Lithium Loop” (from mining to recycling) ensures it becomes a hub for domestic battery supply chains, reducing reliance on Chinese lithium refining.

Timeline and Risk Mitigation: A 2027 Milestone with Safeguards

Construction is on track to meet its late 2027 completion target, with:

- 60% of engineering already complete (90% expected by year-end).

- Structural steel fabrication underway, with first installations in September 2025.

- Risk mitigation via a limestone quarry (to cut costs) and a 75% local cost base (labor/services), minimizing tariff exposure.

While regulatory risks linger (e.g., tribal land disputes), the project has secured permits and court rulings supporting its path forward. Lithium Americas' cash reserves ($446.9M as of March 2025) provide further financial cushioning.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip Before 2027's Payoff

Lithium Americas' stock (LAC) has underperformed lithium peers recently, reflecting near-term losses from construction costs. However, the 2027 operational ramp-up is the inflection point. Key catalysts include:

1. Q3 2025 DOE Loan Draw: Signals execution strength.

2. 2026 Earthworks Completion: A physical milestone for investors.

3. GM's Production Ramp: Lithium sales will begin flowing into earnings by 2028.

Investment Strategy:

- Buy on dips below $5.50/share (current ~$6.20), targeting a 2027 valuation of $10–12/share.

- Hold for the long term: Thacker Pass's 40+ year mine life and expansion potential (up to 100,000 tpa) create multi-decade earnings growth.

- Consider options or ETNs: Lithium ETFs (e.g., LIT) offer diversification but lack the pure-play upside of LAC.

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age

Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency. With GM's demand locked in, DOE's financial and regulatory backing, and IRA incentives turbocharging returns, this project is a generational investment. For those willing to look past short-term volatility, the path to 2027—and dominance of the EV supply chain—is clear.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:07:52.880373

Among them, Rio Tinto's dual-state strategy in Arizona and Utah positions it as a pivotal player in reshaping the nation's mineral security. With President Trump's 50% copper import tariffs now in effect, domestic projects like Resolution Copper and the expanded Kennecott mine are set to capitalize on structural demand shifts. This article argues that Rio Tinto's investments represent a compelling opportunity to profit from both policy-driven market dynamics and the surging need for critical minerals.

The Tariff Tailwind: Manufacturing a Domestic Copper Renaissance

The Trump administration's 50% tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, 2025, marks a decisive shift toward reshoring critical mineral production. By penalizing imports from top suppliers like Chile and Peru—sources of 82% of U.S. copper imports—the tariffs create a $1.5 billion annual price advantage for domestic producers. This structural shift has already driven U.S. copper prices to a $5.60/lb premium over global benchmarks, a trend set to accelerate as global demand for clean energy infrastructure (electric vehicles, solar panels) outpaces supply.

Resolution Copper: A Game-Changer in Reducing Import Dependency

Resolution Copper, Rio Tinto's flagship project in Arizona, is poised to supply up to 25% of U.S. copper demand once operational by the late 2020s. With 1.6 billion metric tons of ore and a $61 billion projected economic impact, the mine's development hinges on a final August 2025 land transfer approval. This milestone follows a Supreme Court ruling dismissing Indigenous land claims, clearing a major legal hurdle. The project's block-caving technology and water-efficient design (using 5 gallons/lb of copper, half the industry average) also address environmental concerns, ensuring alignment with ESG priorities.

Kennecott's Role in Utah: A Steady Engine of Production

While Resolution Copper captures headlines, Rio Tinto's Kennecott mine in Utah remains the unsung backbone of its U.S. strategy. Producing 300,000 tons of refined copper annually, Kennecott's underground expansions (including the NRS project) will extend its lifespan to 2040. By integrating mining, smelting, and refining under one roof, Kennecott avoids tariff-driven supply chain disruptions, acting as a reliable domestic supplier for industries like construction and renewables.

Strategic Alignment with U.S. Critical Minerals Policy

The U.S. government's Critical Minerals Strategy, updated in 2025, explicitly names copper as essential for national defense and energy infrastructure. Rio Tinto's projects directly address this mandate:

- Geopolitical Security: Reducing reliance on foreign sources (82% of imports from politically unstable regions).

- Energy Transition: Copper's role in EV batteries (40 kg per vehicle vs. 20 kg in ICE vehicles) ensures steady demand.

- Tax Incentives: The Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion clean energy tax credits further subsidize domestic production.

Why Invest Now? Timeline, Demand, and Risk-Adjusted Returns

Project Milestones: The August 2025 land transfer for Resolution Copper is a binary catalyst. If approved, construction begins by 2027, with first production by 2031.

Demand Surge: Global copper demand for EVs alone is projected to grow by 250% by 2030, per the International Energy Agency.

Risk-Adjusted Case: While permitting delays or legal challenges linger, Resolution's progress and the tariff-driven premium create a robust margin of safety.

Risks and Considerations

Permitting Delays: U.S. environmental reviews can stretch timelines, though Resolution's decade-long EIS process mitigates this risk.

Environmental Opposition: Tribal groups and green advocates may prolong litigation, though courts have consistently upheld the project's legal basis.

Global Oversupply: A potential copper glut in 2030 could pressure prices, though tariffs and domestic demand should cushion impacts.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

During this real-life test of the battery base installed in Texas, it generated more than 6 GW of electricity on Friday evening, helping to stabilize the grid with less input from fossil fuel-powered plants that are typically used for managing load during peak times.

The robust performance of the large-scale battery energy storage systems in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid came without shutdowns like the one that happened in Southern Europe this spring, too.

After the global solar power installation reached 600 GW last year, and is on its way to hit 1 TW annually in the next few, storing all that energy for discharge in peak times has become a pressing question.

It is not clear what share of the storage battery projects in Texas is done with Tesla Megapacks. Just last August, ERCOT added 480 MW in battery storage projects to the grid, and these included Tesla's own BESS installed at its Gigafactory in Austin.

Its Megapacks still use Chinese LFP cells, though, of the type that are in popular mobile power stations like the Anker Solix C1000. So do most other grid-level battery systems in Texas, and even Tesla's intent to produce LFP batteries in America won't change that share in a meaningful way any time soon.

Texas is leading the country in the deployment speed of BESS projects coming online, and the installed US base is now second after China. Scale is important, as renewable energy sources like wind and solar might be one of the cheapest ways to generate electricity, but pairing all that energy with storage solutions quickly changes the calculus in favor of nuclear and others.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Tesla-gigafactory-texas.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:11:06.905264

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world's largest untapped renewable energy resource.
Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a ""very significant milestone"" that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.
Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy.
With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.","Submerged in about 44 yards of water off Scotland's coast, a turbine has been spinning for more than six years to harness the power of ocean tides for electricity -- a durability mark that demonstrates the technology's commercial viability.

Keeping a large, or grid-scale, turbine in place in the harsh sea environment that long is a record that helps pave the way for bigger tidal energy farms and makes it far more appealing to investors, according to the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. Tidal energy projects would be prohibitively expensive if the turbines had to be taken out of the water for maintenance every couple of years.

Tidal energy technologies are still in the early days of their commercial development, but their potential for generating clean energy is big. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world's largest untapped renewable energy resource.

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually. Earlier this month, the Swedish company SKF announced that its bearings and seals on one of the turbines had passed the 6½-year mark without needing unplanned or disruptive maintenance. It has been working closely with the industry for a decade on design and testing.

Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a ""very significant milestone"" that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.

Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy. The MeyGen site, operated by SAE Renewables, has been sending electricity to the grid for about eight years.

There are very few tidal energy projects generating electricity continuously. Most have been tests and demonstrations, said Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development. Copping said there are still large hurdles to overcome before tidal energy can be adopted more widely, such as dealing with regulatory issues, potential environmental effects and conflicts with other ocean users.

Still, the Scotland project seems to have addressed the question of whether the turbines can last in seawater, added Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

""I think they have checked the boxes,"" she said. ""Because skeptics, and that includes investors of course and governments, said, 'How on Earth are you going to operate these things especially for any length of time in this very tough environment?' And that's what I think they proved.""

It's very hard to take what is essentially a wind turbine normally found on land and put it under water, said Fraser Johnson, operations and maintenance manager at MeyGen. The record-setting turbine should keep going for at least another year before it needs to come out of the water for maintenance, he added.

The four turbines are in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a narrow channel between the Scottish mainland and Stroma Island known for strong tidal currents. Tidal energy systems need strong currents to make electricity efficiently. MeyGen plans to add 20 turbines in 2030 to produce more electricity, after needed upgrades to the electricity grid are finished. The site could eventually hold as many as 130 turbines that are more powerful than those at the site today.

The MeyGen site is in the open water, while another type of tidal project involves creating a dam-like structure called a barrage across tidal waters. With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.

""It's a title we wish we didn't have. We want more, we want others,"" he said. ""Unfortunately others are having difficulty achieving what MeyGen has achieved. But working with SKF moving forward, we'll push the industry forward.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/210560126_210552522-25daa91bb58e4231adbbed308fecd5fd_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:38.680950

Meanwhile, Enbridge's valuation metrics have stretched.
The Long-Term Case: Moats, Cash Flows, and Dividend Resilience Despite these near-term headwinds, Enbridge's core strengths remain intact.
Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate.","Investors in Enbridge (ENB) face a classic conundrum: a company with a fortress-like balance sheet and a pipeline of regulated, cash-generating projects is currently trading at valuation levels that reflect little margin for error. While near-term risks—elevated debt, regulatory uncertainty, and overperformance—loom large, the stock's intrinsic value is underpinned by structural tailwinds. For income investors, the math remains compelling, but momentum traders should tread carefully.

The Near-Term Crosscurrents: Debt, Valuation, and Regulatory Overhang

Enbridge's debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.9x (as of Q1 2025) has drawn scrutiny, particularly as the metric includes partial contributions from recently acquired U.S. gas utilities. Management expects the ratio to improve toward its 4.5–5.0x target range as these assets contribute fully in 2025. However, the company's $2.8 billion in February 2025 senior note issuances—spanning 3-year to 30-year maturities—highlight its reliance on debt markets to fund growth.

Meanwhile, Enbridge's valuation metrics have stretched. At a trailing P/E of ~18x (vs. its 5-year average of 15x), the stock trades at a premium to peers like Kinder Morgan (KMI) and TC Energy (TRP). This premium reflects investor optimism about its $28 billion secured growth backlog, but it leaves little room for missteps. A misfire on regulatory approvals or a delay in projects like the Traverse Pipeline (pending permits for its 1.8 Bcf/d capacity expansion) could trigger a reassessment.

Regulatory risks remain a wildcard. In Canada, the newly elected government's stance on energy infrastructure—particularly the contentious Alberta-to-Prince Rupert pipeline—could introduce headwinds. In the U.S., state-level rate cases in North Carolina and Utah underscore the need for disciplined regulatory engagement to protect margins.

The Long-Term Case: Moats, Cash Flows, and Dividend Resilience

Despite these near-term headwinds, Enbridge's core strengths remain intact. Its Mainline expansion, a cornerstone of its growth strategy, is progressing steadily. The pipeline's record Q1 throughput of 3.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) signals strong demand from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which Enbridge expects to grow by ~1 mbpd by 2035. Phase 1 of the Mainline Optimization—leveraging 150 kbpd of incremental capacity on the Flanagan South Pipeline—bolsters this narrative.

The company's regulated asset base—including its U.S. gas utilities and Canadian distribution networks—provides a predictable earnings stream. Regulated projects like the Birch Grove expansion (adding $400 million to the backlog) and the Traverse Pipeline are underpinned by cost-of-service models, shielding cash flows from commodity price volatility.

Crucially, Enbridge's dividend resilience remains a pillar of its appeal. With a 5-year average dividend growth rate of ~2%, the stock's ~5.8% dividend yield (as of July 2025) offers income investors a cushion against short-term price fluctuations. Management's reaffirmed 2025 DCF guidance ($5.50–$5.90 per share) underscores confidence in its ability to fund payouts even amid macro challenges.

Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays

For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate. The stock's ~7–9% EBITDA growth through 2026 and its long-term 5% annual growth trajectory post-2026 suggest that total shareholder returns (TSR) will outpace short-term volatility.

However, momentum traders face a tougher calculus. The stock's ~18% YTD return in 2025 (as of July) has compressed its valuation cushion. Near-term catalysts—including regulatory outcomes for the Traverse Pipeline and the Southern Illinois Connector's open season results—could lead to sharp price swings. Without a catalyst to justify further upside, the risk-reward tilts toward caution.

The world's first intelligent grid-forming photovoltaic and energy storage power station, tailored for ultra-high altitudes, low-temperatures and weak-grid scenarios, has been connected to the grid in Ngari Prefecture, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region.

In a landscape with an average altitude of about 4,700 meters, this pioneering energy storage system developed by tech giant Huawei, based in south China's Shenzhen, has rewritten the rules of power delivery in extreme conditions.

Situated on the edge of the region's power grid, Ngari has a high proportion of new energy installations but a weak grid -- connected to the main grid 500 kilometers away via a single 110-kilovolt line.

A 30MW solar power project's output was previously capped at 1.5MW. Moreover, equipment cooling and operation are hampered by air pressure and thin oxygen. The innovative new battery system, notably, has stepped in where conventional power solutions have fallen short.

As an engineering breakthrough, the station does not amount to mere storage units, but rather features digital power plants capable of creating stability -- generating their own voltage and frequency signals to improve the local grid infrastructure.

Now, the project's photovoltaic output has increased from the previous maximum of 1.5MW to 12MW. ""Over 10 days of monitoring, Huawei's grid-forming energy storage maintained voltage and frequency stability through more than 40 major grid disturbances, achieving 100 percent reliability,"" said Yang Mingsheng, general manager of the project.

Nextracker, a leader in solar tracker technology, is positioning itself at the forefront of this transition. By combining advanced hardware innovation, domestic manufacturing expertise, and a circular economy partnership with SOLARCYCLE, the company is redefining how solar energy systems are built, maintained, and recycled. For investors, this strategic alignment with global decarbonization goals and supply chain reshoring trends presents a compelling growth opportunity.

The Power of Advanced Tracker Technology

Nextracker's SMART Solar Trackers are engineered to maximize energy output while minimizing environmental impact. The NX Horizon-XTR series, for instance, features terrain-following capabilities that allow solar arrays to conform to uneven landscapes without costly grading or foundation modifications. In a 328 MW Texas project, this technology reduced foundation pile lengths by 27 inches and cut steel usage by 1,928,602 lbs, slashing construction costs by millions.

The NX Horizon Hail Pro, meanwhile, addresses extreme weather risks with rapid stow mechanisms and 75-degree tilt angles, reducing insurance costs and operational downtime in hail-prone regions. Paired with Nextracker's TrueCapture software suite, which includes AI-driven Zonal Diffuse algorithms, these trackers optimize energy yield by dynamically adjusting to cloud cover and terrain variations.

Domestic Manufacturing: Securing Supply Chains

Nextracker's commitment to domestic production is a strategic response to supply chain vulnerabilities and U.S. government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). By achieving 100% U.S. domestic content compliance for trackers, the company has secured a competitive edge in the booming North American solar market.

This focus on local manufacturing has fueled revenue growth. In FY2025, Nextracker reported a 18% year-over-year revenue increase to $3 billion, with bookings surpassing 26 GW. The IRA's production tax credits and domestic content requirements are expected to further boost demand, as projects relying on federal incentives will increasingly favor U.S.-made components.

Circular Economy: Closing the Solar Lifecycle Loop

Nextracker's partnership with SOLARCYCLE, a leading solar panel recycler, addresses a critical blind spot in the renewable energy lifecycle: end-of-life panel disposal. By ensuring panels are recycled into raw materials for new systems, Nextracker reduces waste and lowers the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) over time. This closed-loop model aligns with the EU's Circular Economy Action Plan and global ESG mandates, positioning Nextracker as a sustainability leader.

Investment Thesis: Riding the Renewable Wave

Nextracker's strategic moves—advanced tech, domestic manufacturing, and circular partnerships—align perfectly with two megatrends:

1. Global Renewable Targets: The International Energy Agency projects solar capacity must grow by 40% annually through 2030 to meet climate goals. Nextracker's high-efficiency trackers are critical to achieving this scale.

2. Supply Chain Reshoring: As governments prioritize domestic production, Nextracker's IRA-compliant facilities and partnerships (e.g., the Bentek Corporation acquisition for eBOS systems) create a moat against global competitors.

Risk Considerations and Opportunities

While Nextracker's trajectory is strong, risks include solar panel oversupply in some regions and geopolitical trade disputes. However, its focus on high-value, high-margin tracker systems—versus commoditized panels—mitigates pricing pressures. Additionally, its expansion into AI-driven predictive maintenance and terrain analytics could unlock new service revenue streams.

Conclusion: A Leader in the Renewable Transition

Nextracker is not just a tracker manufacturer—it's a solutions provider for the entire solar lifecycle. With a robust order backlog ($3.4 billion as of Q1 2025) and partnerships that reduce carbon footprints, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the $1.3 trillion U.S. clean energy market under the IRA. Investors seeking exposure to a decarbonizing economy and resilient supply chains should consider Nextracker as a core holding.

Recommendation: Buy Nextracker stock with a long-term horizon. Monitor its FY2026 guidance for further upside, particularly in international markets like Australia and Latin America.

The system stands out because it could replace natural gas in industries that need extremely high temperatures. Many manufacturing facilities still burn gas because solar and wind energy cannot generate enough heat for industrial processes. NuCube provides an alternative with around-the-clock clean power.

Switching from gas to nuclear means less pollution that causes breathing problems and contributes to rising global temperatures. It also adds another option to our clean energy mix alongside solar and wind, helping maintain power even during cloudy or windless periods.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.
OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said: 'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality.","Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) has proposed key reforms to accelerate offshore wind generation following the government’s publication of its Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA).

OEUK says the decision to take a national approach to pricing will encourage more wind energy investment to help the government hit its Clean Power 2030 targets and boost growth in the critical offshore energy supply chain.

The National Energy System Operator has given 5,000 energy projects in the queue for grid connections until 29th July to submit evidence for preferential treatment.

The move is intended to prioritise 'shovel-ready' projects and scrap the first-come, first-served approach, which has allowed speculative schemes to delay viable clean energy developments.

This proposal must be matched by reforms to the Contacts for Difference (CfD) scheme and planning system to ensure the next allocation round – AR7 – delivers the scale and pace needed.

OEUK’s analysis shows that to meet the CP30 goal of 95% clean power by 2030, the UK must deliver half of this target from offshore wind. This means at least 43 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity must be installed by 2030, but current projections fall short at just 35GW. The next three CfD rounds must therefore secure an additional 20GW- equivalent to powering around 15 million homes.

Only two offshore wind generation projects – GreenVolt in Scotland and East Anglia Two – have been supported by the government’s CfD scheme since 2022.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.

Offshore wind is one of the UK’s greatest energy success stories – generating low carbon electricity at scale, creating jobs, and revitalising coastal communities.

Fixed-bottom turbines, with so-called monopiles attached to the seabed in shallower waters, have driven the UK’s rapid growth of wind energy generation to date but floating wind turbines using newer technologies, can be anchored in deeper waters with stronger wind resources, opening new areas for development.

They also have fewer environmental constraints than fixed-bottom projects and can progress more smoothly through the consenting process.

Speed and clarity to reform grid access and a more transparent approach with equal treatment for fixed and floating wind farms would give developers and the supply chain greater confidence to invest.

OEUK’s key recommendations for AR7 and beyond:

• Support for offshore wind: Provide assurance that sufficient funding is available for both fixed and commercial floating wind projects over the next three years, including projects to decarbonise offshore oil and gas operations, strengthen the UK supply chain, and create export opportunities.

• Grid and consent reform: Improved risk sharing between developers and grid network operators plus increased administrative capacity and streamlined planning to reduce delays to grid connection. Compensation should be offered for unexpected hold ups.

• Eligibility and investment: Reform eligibility criteria to allow both fixed and floating wind projects that have not received full consent to bid in the auction, extend CfD contracts from 15 to 20 years and introduce a well-balance cap and floor to transmission charges to improve investor confidence, lower subsidies and reduce costs to consumers. Introduce a well-balanced cap and floor to transmission charges.

OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said:

'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality. That means enabling floating wind to compete on equal footing, unlocking grid access, and giving developers the confidence to invest at scale.

'We’re calling for clear eligibility rules that allow well-progressed but unconsented projects to bid, longer CfD terms to reduce costs to consumers, and a firm commitment to grid and consenting reform – including compensation for delays. These are the changes our members need to deliver the next 20GW.

'At the same time, we are working with our members to reduce project risk and borrowing costs as well as improving contractual relationships and promoting standardisation of modular wind turbine components to make them cheaper and faster to install.

'There is only one energy supply chain for offshore wind and oil and gas – and it cannot be allowed to decline. With the right reforms and a pragmatic energy strategy which supports homegrown oil and gas alongside the acceleration of UK renewables, the North Sea can remain a global energy powerhouse, supporting economic growth, jobs, and our climate goals.'

ScotWind: OEUK supports the ambition of the ScotWind leasing round and is calling for clarity on delivery timelines, grid access, and supply chain investment to ensure projects can rapidly move forward.

INTOG: OEUK backs INTOG schemes using wind energy to decarbonise offshore oil and gas production. We are urging government and regulators to ensure these projects are prioritised for grid access and CfD eligibility, and that planning processes reflect their dual role in emissions reduction and clean power generation.

Celtic Sea Round 5 of Celtic Sea wind auctions held last month (June) aims to unlock the potential for floating offshore wind off the coasts of South Wales and Southwest England. The Crown Estate has selected Equinor and Gwynt Glas to develop two 1.5GW floating wind farms. The leases come with grid connections already approved, but only two out of three leases on offer have been taken up.

TNUoS: Transmission Network Use of System Charges. Transmission has a cost which is paid by the generator and the user which appears in electricity bills. This cost is expected to increase dramatically in future years as more energy is brought from Scotland to England. The connection cost for the generator rises for remote areas but in heavily populated areas generators are paid to connect. The price difference must be adjusted with a proposed cap and floor system that would introduce an upper maximum cost to Scottish projects.

Review of electricity market arrangements (REMA): The government is still to announce the full outcome of its REMA consultation beyond the already published decision on zonal pricing. OEUK is calling for introduction of ‘deemed contracts for difference’ (based on potential, not actual output). This would mean wind energy producers being paid according to their potential capacity in a system that would give producers the opportunity to benefit from high global wind energy prices when they are available and keep a proportion of the additional profits

In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.","One of the drivers of these disruptions in the electricity market has been the EPA’s regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. This has been the case with its carbon rule, which would have shut down the nation’s fleet of coal power plants despite warnings from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation that more than half of the United States is at risk for electricity shortages over the next five years.

The risk of electricity shortages is being fueled by the explosion in electricity demand from artificial intelligence and the new data centers required to power this technology. An Energy Department report found that the amount of U.S. electricity consumed by data centers is expected to jump from 4.4% in 2023 to between 6.7% and 12% by 2028.

While electricity providers and grid operators have been talking about how to prepare for this massive demand spike, EPA regulations have made their job even more challenging. For example, the carbon rule would have illegally forced utilities to either shift generations away from coal, install expensive and unproven technology on existing coal plants, or shut the plants down altogether. Already, more than 120 coal units across 32 states are now scheduled to shut down within the next five years, unless steps are taken to stop these retirements. The carbon rule would have made matters even worse.

The goal of the Biden carbon rule was to make the U.S. reliant on wind and solar power, but such a dramatic transition carries heavy risks to the reliability of our grid.

We can look to the recent blackouts in Europe as a warning for us here in our country. For example, Spain has pursued aggressive policies to transition its grid to renewables. On April 16, the country boasted that for the first time, and for just a few minutes, renewables were delivering 100% of the nation’s electricity. Just 12 days later, a grid failure led to a prolonged blackout that plunged the country into darkness for days.

Solar and wind are intermittent sources of electricity because they, unlike coal, lack the capabilities necessary to serve as baseload sources of power capable of meeting demand at all hours and in all weather conditions. And it is reliable, dispatchable power that will be required to meet the demands of data centers, which operate 24/7.

In addition to hurting our nation’s electric reliability, the Biden-era carbon rule also undermines our national security. While premature coal retirements shrink America’s power supply, China is rapidly building new coal plants to strengthen its grid and expand its economy.

WHY THE KREMLIN HAS DELEGATED ITS TRUMP REBUKES TO STATE MEDIA

China, which already has the world’s largest coal fleet, plans to build another 420,000 megawatts of coal power. With these additions, China’s coal fleet will be almost 10 times larger than that of the U.S. Coal’s resurgence in China and other countries including India underscores how taking America’s coal fleet offline would make little impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. Today, the U.S. power sector is responsible for just 3% of global carbon emissions.

The growth of AI and other advanced technologies will require the U.S. to build new sources of electricity generation, but at a minimum, we need to stop needlessly retiring our existing coal fleet. In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited.
Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two.
Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel.
The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species.","EV battery cooling tech has come pretty far in the last 30 years. The GM EV1, for instance, was reengineered in 1999 with an air tunnel to properly cool its optional nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, but it still couldn't be sold in Arizona because the battery still got too hot. Now, however, we have advanced cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch-style lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with liquid cooling (typically ethylene glycol, a.k.a. antifreeze) and active air solutions to handle environmental extremes — even in Arizona.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited. Active air cooling employs fans or chilled air from the HVAC system, and is still the method used by the Lexus UX300e, though indirect liquid cooling can better tackle current EV power levels. Direct liquid cooling isn't used for consumer EVs because the batteries would need to make, well, direct contact with a liquid, and it would need to have zero electrical conductivity to avoid shorting the battery.

Most EVs use cold plates (also called cooling plates), which feature coolant passages strewn through a flat sheet of metal adhered directly to the bottoms of battery cells. Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two. Rivian, Hyundai, Ford, GM, and Lucid all use cold plates. Tesla, on the other hand, routes coolant pipes throughout the cells, which may be done so that its 4680 batteries can vent from the bottom in case of thermal runaway, or to be different and make this article longer.

Tesla's battery cooling has undergone quite a few revisions to improve temperature regulation of its cylindrical cells. In the Model S P85D, one coolant path chills 444 cells. The problem is that coolant gets quite warm by the end of its journey, especially given how many cells it must handle. So, for the P100D, Tesla switched to two paths that each cool 258 cells. In the Model S Plaid, 11 individual coolant pipes are responsible for just 144 cells each. Coolant passages also changed from being relatively straight up to 2017, meaning they contacted a small portion of each cell's side, to serpentine in 2018, dramatically improving the contact patch.

While Tesla has refined intra-cell piping, cold plates have two big advantages. First, cold plates allow the battery to have more cells packed horizontally. Second, as Peter Rawlinson of Lucid told Auto Evolution, cold plates in the remarkably quick Lucid Air Sapphire cool the battery more efficiently since they contact the bottom of the cell, or the anode, where much of the heat builds up. Either way, temperature monitoring ensures the battery stays in a safe, usable range.

Each automaker employs cold plates in its own way. Lucid uses a super-thin layer of adhesive to join the cells to each cold plate for the best possible thermal conductivity, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 uses a comparatively thick adhesive that results in more distance between the cells and the plate. However, the Ioniq 5 also uses one massive cold plate rather than individual plates for each battery pack. Rivian uses cold plates too, but sandwiches them between the cells to cool two layers at once.

The Hummer EV, a vehicle larger than some buildings, places cold plates on top of individual battery packs in a gargantuan steel enclosure. These cold plates can become hot plates, warming the battery to the optimal temperature range when entering Watts To Freedom (WTF) mode, unlocking the full 1,000 hp. The Hummer's heat pump also chills the motors for peak efficiency.

Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel. Not only is aluminum lighter, but it's more efficient at dissipating heat. Of course, the Hummer EV 3X doesn't care about the weight of steel because it makes 1,000 hp and a ridiculous 11,500 lb-ft of torque, if you listen to marketing, or a more realistic but still insane 1,000 to 1,100 lb-ft (if you go by Road & Track and Autoweek's reporting).

If a Hummer EV is like winning the torque Powerball, an extended range Ford F-150 Lightning at 580 hp and 775 lb-ft is still like winning a $500 a week for life scratch-off. Incredible, but not quite in the same power ballpark. Plus, if Hummers have to heat the battery in WTF mode anyway, steel's thermal properties might be irrelevant. Strange how the Hummer EV is the least efficient EV you can buy.

The huge variety of cooling solutions is mind-boggling, and detailing every system would result in a Dostoyevsky-length novel. The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species. Still, like Galapagos finch beaks, there's still plenty of micro-evolution happening, like GM's U-shaped prismatic batteries, and we have yet to see which changes help EVs adapt to our world the best.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/how-electric-vehicles-like-teslas-fords-gms-keep-batteries-cool/l-intro-1752183144.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:05.545757

Recent research suggests that natural hydrogen, continuously produced by the Earth’s crust, could power our planet for an astounding 170,000 years. This immense potential transforms the conversation around energy transitions, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a future powered by a resource that has been quietly accumulating for millions, if not billions, of years. But what is the reality of accessing this hidden treasure?

An Abundant Yet Largely Untapped Gas

Hydrogen today is pivotal in various industrial applications, such as ammonia and methanol production. It’s also heralded as a clean energy carrier, with the potential to power vehicles and energy grids. However, most of this hydrogen is derived from hydrocarbons, which emit greenhouse gases during production. Natural hydrogen, in contrast, forms without human intervention through geochemical reactions between specific rocks and water, emitting no carbon and requiring no external energy input. This naturally occurring hydrogen can remain trapped underground for thousands of years, creating potentially exploitable reserves.

While these reserves were once thought rare, recent studies indicate they might be widespread if we know where to look. This revelation could significantly alter our approach to clean energy, as natural hydrogen represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional energy sources.

“This Reactor Is a Game-Changer for America”: US Launches World’s First Nuclear Plant Producing Hydrogen, Triggering a New Era in Clean Energy

The Three Key Conditions for Deposit Formation

According to geochemist Chris Ballentine and his team, creating a natural hydrogen deposit depends on three critical elements: a production source, a reservoir for gas storage, and a geological barrier to trap it. Production typically results from geochemical processes, with the most common being the reaction of iron or magnesium-rich rocks with water, continuously releasing hydrogen underground.

The reservoir must be sufficiently porous to store hydrogen, while the cap rock, often composed of clays or salts, must prevent the gas from escaping. These criteria, familiar in the oil and gas industry, can now be applied to hydrogen exploration, opening new avenues for sustainable energy sourcing. Understanding these geological conditions is essential for identifying viable hydrogen reserves.

Promising Geological Regions

Certain geological formations are particularly conducive to hydrogen accumulation. These include ophiolites, which are ancient oceanic floors lifted to the surface, igneous provinces with volcanic rock, and ancient greenstone belts, some over three billion years old.

In the United States, attention is focused on Kansas, where an old rift zone rich in basalts may contain significant hydrogen reserves. In Albania, a vast reservoir has been identified within an ophiolite complex. These discoveries are attracting industrial interest from companies like Koloma, backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, and others like Hy-Terra and Snowfox, supported by major energy corporations.

“This Changes Everything Overnight”: New US Fuel Cell Simultaneously Generates Power, Stores Massive Energy, and Delivers Clean Hydrogen Without Compromise

A Parameter Not to Overlook: Bacteria

Despite the potential abundance of underground hydrogen, its exploitation is not guaranteed. Subsurface bacteria that consume hydrogen can significantly reduce available volumes. According to researcher Barbara Sherwood Lollar, environments conducive to these microorganisms are less promising for exploration. Understanding and mitigating this biological factor is crucial for assessing the true potential of natural hydrogen deposits.

A Roadmap for Exploration

The study offers a comprehensive synthesis of hydrogen formation and accumulation mechanisms, providing geologists and energy companies with a clear roadmap for exploration. It guides exploration campaigns toward areas most likely to contain economically viable deposits.

While uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the extractable quantity of natural hydrogen, the prospects are immense. An abundant, naturally renewing, clean resource already stored underground could make natural hydrogen a central player in the energy transition over the coming decades. What new developments will unfold as we continue to explore this untapped energy frontier?

For investors, the sector presents compelling opportunities in energy-efficient EV manufacturing and supply chains aligned with the government's priorities—provided risks like regulatory delays and cost volatility are managed.","The UK's automotive sector is undergoing a seismic shift, propelled by the government's £2.5bn DRIVE35 initiative and a suite of trade deals aimed at reclaiming its position as a global leader in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) manufacturing. While the program promises to unlock £50bn in economic potential by 2030, investors must navigate a complex landscape of subsidies, energy costs, and regulatory hurdles to capitalize on emerging opportunities. This analysis dissects the strategic advantages and risks tied to the sector's transformation, offering actionable insights for investors.

Funding the Transition: Targeting Pain Points with Precision

The DRIVE35 program allocates £2bn for R&D in automotive and related sectors by 2030, alongside an additional £500m for scale-up grants (up to £20m per project). This funding directly addresses three critical pain points:

1. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: By prioritizing battery production, gigafactories, and green hydrogen infrastructure, the UK aims to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.

2. Private Investment Gaps: The £6.6bn target for private capital underscores the government's role in de-risking projects like battery manufacturing and software-defined vehicles.

3. Competitiveness: Scale-up grants for EV technologies (e.g., vehicle-to-grid systems) position UK firms to dominate emerging markets.

The program's focus on sectors like EV charging infrastructure (£400m allocated) and defense-aligned dual-use tech also creates niches for specialized firms.

Trade Deals: A Competitive Edge, but Not Without Hurdles

Recent trade agreements have slashed tariffs and expanded markets:

- UK-US Deal: Tariffs on cars exported to the US fell from 27.5% to 10%, benefiting luxury brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin.

- India Deal: A 100% tariff reduction to 10% opens a booming market for high-end vehicles.

- CPTPP Access: Entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership grants access to £12tn in markets, though automotive specifics remain under negotiation.

However, the EU-UK “reset” remains incomplete. Rules of origin ambiguities and lingering customs delays could undermine the 80% of UK car exports that still rely on EU supply chains.

The Energy Cost Conundrum: A Make-or-Break Factor

High energy prices threaten to negate the sector's potential. UK manufacturers pay up to four times more for electricity than US competitors, with battery producers in Scotland facing costs 20% higher than in Germany. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme aims to reduce industrial electricity costs by £35–40/MWh, but its narrow focus on battery production—excluding broader automotive manufacturing—leaves critical gaps.

Without extending relief to the entire sector, the UK risks losing investment to lower-cost regions like Spain or Poland.

EV Market Challenges: Lagging Demand and Policy Uncertainty

Despite £6.5bn in industry investments to boost EV adoption, sales fell 12.8% in early 2025, underscoring the need for urgent reforms:

- Tax Incentives: The Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and Expensive Car Supplement (ECS) penalize EV buyers, costing the sector £360m annually.

- Regulatory Volatility: Past reversals on ZEV mandates have eroded industry confidence. SMMT estimates that halving EV VAT could shift 2m sales to electric by 2030.

The 2030 ICE phaseout remains at risk unless policies align with consumer affordability and charging infrastructure.

Unlocking the £50bn Potential: The Path Forward

To realize this economic ambition, the UK must:

1. Accelerate Energy Cost Reforms: Extend the competitiveness scheme to all automotive manufacturers, not just battery producers.

2. Fix the Tax Code: Remove punitive levies like the ECS and reinstate EV purchase incentives.

3. Streamline Regulation: Finalize the Subsidy Advice Unit's review of DRIVE35 grants (due August 2025) and align EU battery recycling rules to avoid trade barriers.

4. Invest in Skills: Scale up apprenticeships and visas for tech talent in AI and engineering.

Investment Strategy: Where to Focus

Opportunities to Watch:

- Battery Manufacturers: Companies like Britishvolt or those partnering with gigafactories (e.g., Tata's £1bn Somerset plant) stand to benefit from £5.8bn allocated to energy storage.

- EV Charging Infrastructure: Firms like EO Charging or Pivot Power, which operate nationwide networks, are critical to meeting the £1.4bn EV uptake goal.

- Software-Defined Vehicles: Startups developing autonomous driving or V2G tech may attract DRIVE35 grants.

Risks to Monitor:

- Energy Cost Delays: A failure to address Scotland's high tariffs or extend reforms could trigger capital flight.

- Policy Inconsistency: Fluctuating ZEV mandates or EU trade disputes could disrupt supply chains.

- Global Competition: China's dominance (31% of global vehicle output) and U.S. subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act require agility.

Conclusion: A High-Reward, High-Risk Journey

The DRIVE35 program and trade deals offer a clear roadmap for the UK to become a ZEV manufacturing powerhouse. Yet success hinges on resolving energy cost disparities, stabilizing policy frameworks, and accelerating EV adoption. For investors, the sector presents compelling opportunities in energy-efficient EV manufacturing and supply chains aligned with the government's priorities—provided risks like regulatory delays and cost volatility are managed.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:20.818869

Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours.
Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.","A summer of blackouts in Yucatán will extend into Monday as the Federal Electricity Commission schedules power cuts for 16 coastal communities. The planned blackouts will run from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., though CFE said the work might take less than eight hours.

Temperatures along the coast are expected to reach almost 90°F / 32°C under sunny skies. Residents will be relying on Gulf breezes to stay cool.

The scheduled blackouts affect Progreso and surrounding areas. CFE said the work connects a new substation and modernizes the electrical system in response to ongoing power cuts that have plagued the region.

The announcement follows weeks of unplanned blackouts across Yucatán. Some neighborhoods in Mérida and Campeche have experienced frequent and prolonged power failures, leaving residents without electricity, clean water, or basic services. In southern Mérida, residents of the Zazil-Há and Cinco Colonias neighborhoods have endured constant Yucatán blackouts for two weeks, lasting several hours at a time.

Blackouts in Yucatán Follow Regional Pattern

Yucatán’s frequent blackouts, brownouts and appliance-killing power surges reflect chronic electrical infrastructure challenges that stretch back years. In May 2024, blackouts hit 21 of Mexico’s 32 states, forcing the National Energy Control Center to declare emergency conditions multiple times. Blackouts in Yucatán weren’t spared from the national crisis.

The CFE electrical network is stressed due to excessive demand for supply to mitigate the extreme heat that prevails during Yucatán blackouts. Local experts say the blackouts in Yucatán require long-term fixes. Dr. Rubén Domínguez Maldonado from Anáhuac Mayab University told reporters that without scheduled blackouts, heat damage to lines and transformers would create more expensive repairs and longer Yucatán blackouts.

Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours. The persistent have pushed some communities to protest. Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.

Political Response Draws Criticism

President Claudia Sheinbaum’s June visit to Yucatán sparked controversy over her comments about the blackouts in Yucatán. She declared that “the opposition’s campaign about the lack of electricity in Yucatán is not in line with reality, since there is sufficient infrastructure.”

Her statement contrasted sharply with residents’ experiences of Yucatán blackouts. In communities like Cheumán, families with babies struggle to store milk and food for their children during extended blackouts in Yucatán. Local researcher Gina Villagómez Valdés documented cases where residents have been without power for days, with blackouts damaging their electrical appliances.

CFE has announced multiple infrastructure projects over the years to address blackouts in Yucatán with mixed results. In 2019, President López Obrador promised a new power plant during a Yucatan tour, declaring it would ensure “there will never be any blackouts” in the state. However, energy sector experts noted that this promised plant was not part of CFE’s strategic plan to address Yucatán’s frequent power failures.

CFE has invested over 151 billion pesos to improve energy supply and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, including plans for two combined-cycle power plants in Mérida and Valladolid. The plants were originally scheduled to begin operations by summer 2024 to help end Yucatán blackouts, but delays pushed timelines into the future.

The Yucatán state government now works with CFE on a plan to eliminate blackouts by 2027 and achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2030. Governor Joaquín Díaz Mena acknowledged that “Yucatán is facing a complex energy situation, especially during this season of extreme heat” that contributes to blackouts in Yucatán.

National Investment Plans Target Blackouts

The Mexican government presented a National Strategy for the Electricity Sector 2024-2030, planning to invest $23 billion in CFE to address nationwide power issues including Yucatán blackouts. CFE’s 2025-2030 plan includes 12 new power plants with combined capacity of 5,840MW across nine states. However, Yucatán isn’t among the states getting new generation facilities to directly combat blackouts in Yucatán.

To prepare for increased demand during summer 2025 and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, capacitor banks will be installed in seven substations in northern Quintana Roo, representing an investment of 194.39 million pesos ($9.32 million).

Beyond generation capacity, Yucatán blackouts stem from fundamental infrastructure problems. Aging infrastructure and “a mess of ancient wiring” continues to cause blackouts in Yucatán, with haphazardly installed power, telephone, and fiber optic lines characterizing most streets. CFE employees revealed that Yucatán blackouts during the hot season are inevitable due to overloaded connections in new subdivisions.

The communities affected by Monday’s scheduled blackouts include Progreso, Chelem, Chicxulub Puerto, Chuburná Puerto, Dzidzilché, San Ignacio, Misné Balam, Flamboyanes, Santa María Chí, Tamanché, Cosgaya, Komchén, Suytunchén, Kikteil, Xcunyá and Sierra Papacal.

CFE Director General Emilia Esther Calleja Alor recently visited the state and pledged to provide advance notice of future scheduled blackouts to help residents prepare for planned Yucatán blackouts. The commission emphasized these actions “seek to improve the energy infrastructure for the benefit of residents” and businesses in the coastal area affected by recurring blackouts in Yucatán.

For international visitors and residents, the ongoing Yucatán blackouts represent a significant infrastructure concern in a region that depends heavily on tourism and economic development. The peninsula covers roughly 70,000 square miles (181,000 square kilometers) and includes popular destinations like Cancún, Mérida, and the Riviera Maya, all affected by periodic blackouts.",https://yucatanmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CFEexpensive.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:22:44.318149

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications.
The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.
Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities.
The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners.","For years, Wabanaki tribal communities faced a costly dilemma: pay outside contractors $500 to $1,000 per home for energy audits, or go without services that could slash utility bills for hundreds of tribal members.

Now, the federally recognized tribes in Maine are trying a different approach. They’re training their own members as energy auditors and heat-pump technicians, creating immediate cost savings and long-term career pathways that keep energy dollars flowing within the tribal communities.

“We don't want to go outside of the nations to get these services,” Kelsey Flores, coordinator of the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team, told Tribal Business News. “The overall goal is to feed into our resilience and our self-sufficiency.”

The workforce development strategy represents a shift toward self-sufficiency that has become even more urgent after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded a $1.1 million grant in May that supported the tribes’ renewable energy programs.

The effort is led by the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team. The team is composed of representatives from four Native nations: the Penobscot Nation; the Passamaquoddy Tribe (with communities at Pleasant Point and Indian Township); the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians; and the Mi'kmaq Nation. The team also includes partners at the University of Maine.

The team is now offering two energy-related workforce development programs: energy audit training available free to members of the Penobscot Nation, and a three-week pre-apprenticeship program on heat pump installation for up to 20 members of the Wabanaki tribes.

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications. The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Training costs are covered by the Penobscot Nation, and applications are still being accepted for the program through reaching out to Flores or by contacting Build Green Maine directly through their website.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Participants in the program can reduce their home energy consumption by 25% and successful business owners could potentially audit hundreds of homes, Callas told Tribal Business News.

“There’s a couple of different degrees of accomplishment here,” Callas said. “When people come through and do training like ours, they often look around their own house and make changes, at the very least. Some people go on to be entrepreneurs, who will run with this and make it a business to provide this service for other people, or help contractors looking to install things like insulation and sealing.”

The heat pump training takes a different approach, focusing on construction trades and union careers. The three-week pre-apprenticeship program is open to Wabanaki tribal members or descendants who have a high school diploma or equivalent and a valid driver's license, according to Sam Boss, apprenticeship and workforce development director for the Maine chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The program covers lodging, tuition and up to $150 in gas cards for selected trainees.

Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities. The program will train 20 people from across the Wabanaki nations, and applications are still being accepted through Flores with an Aug. 4 deadline.

Boss said the program prepares participants for union apprenticeships that offer paid training, benefits, healthcare and pensions.

“Usually, these pre apprenticeship programs are considered a first step on your pathway to getting into a registered apprenticeship with a union,” Boss told Tribal Business News. “[Those apprenticeships] are a great pathway into the trades, because you're not going into debt, you're getting benefits, great health care and a pension.”

Heat pumps have become increasingly popular in Maine, which has installed more than 100,000 of the energy efficient devices over the past decade — three times the national average, according to Bloomberg. The state’s push toward heat pump adoption has created growing demand for skilled installers.

The workforce programs are moving forward in this growing market, despite losing a primary funding source. Community action grants through the state of Maine have enabled Flores to stay in her position as coordinator and supported the energy audit training. The AFL-CIO partnership has enabled the August 11-29 heat pump training session to continue.

The University of Maine is pursuing a legal dispute to try to recover the EPA funding, according to Flores.

The funding loss highlighted the vulnerability of federal support and reinforced the need for economic strategies that don't depend on government programs, Flores said.

""It's really unfortunate to see how easy it is to strip away crucial funding that was set to positively impact these communities that have been historically underserved,"" Flores said.

But the setback hasn't derailed the long-term vision. The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners. The ultimate goal is creating tribally-owned businesses in the green energy sector that can serve both tribal and broader markets.

“The Wabanaki Nations have always been and will always be resilient, so their energy, visions and goals will remain the same,” Flores said. “We are more than open to expanding our network, solidifying our partnerships, and really working with any partner that is willing to support these projects.”

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue.","United States president Donald Trump expressed his disdain for wind power during a meeting with his Cabinet recently, calling it an expensive form of energy that ""smart"" countries don't use.

His comments contained false and misleading information about the use of wind power in the U.S. and around the world, and came on the heels of an executive order he signed Monday that would end subsidies around ""green"" energy, reports The Associated Press.

Here's a look at the facts.

CLAIM: ""Wind is a very expensive form of energy.""

THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce electricity around US$30 per megawatt hour. This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Onshore wind farms cost less to build and operate than natural gas plants on average in most regions of the U.S., even without tax credits. Though-gas plants are available to produce electricity at any time of the day, unlike wind. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, according to the EIA.

While electricity rates have risen across the U.S. over the past decade, states that have added a significant amount of onshore wind power, such as Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have kept rates from rising as fast as other states, said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation. For example, the share of electricity generated from wind in Iowa increased from 15% in 2010 to nearly 60% of the state's electricity generation in 2023, while the state's electricity rates grew at a rate slower than that of 42 other states, his research found.

Wind power can be expensive if it's built where winds are weaker, but the United States is adding it in places with strong wind resources, he added.

""Wind should be seen as part of an overall portfolio of electricity system resources and is an important part of keeping costs down,"" he said Wednesday.

Trump has committed to increasing U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels. He signed an executive order Monday aimed at phasing out tax credits for wind and solar facilities.

CLAIM: Wind turbines are ""almost exclusively"" made in China, but President Xi Jinping told Trump they have ""very, very few.""

THE FACTS: China is the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines, producing more than half of the supply. It is also installing them in China at a record pace. In total, China has 1.3 terawatts of utility-scale wind and solar capacity in development, which could generate more electricity than neighbouring Japan consumed in all of 2023, according to a report from the Global Energy Monitor released Wednesday. The report highlighted China's offshore wind development, calling China the undisputed leader in the offshore wind sector, though it also said coal and gas are still on the rise across China.

""The whole narrative that we're led to believe in the West is that China is building coal plants and that it's doing nothing for its carbon footprint,"" Tom Harper, partner at the global consultant Baringa, said Tuesday. ""So the surprising thing is China is building a portfolio of zero-carbon resources that are designed to not perfectly complement each other, but to work alongside each other to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.""

CLAIM: ""If you look at smart countries, they don't use it.""

THE FACTS: At least 136 countries and territories around the world use wind power to generate electricity, according to the EIA, with many countries growing the amount they produce. The top five markets for wind power in 2024 were China, the U.S., Brazil, India and Germany, while Uzbekistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia represent the next wave of wind energy growth, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Council CEO Ben Backwell said 2024 marked yet another record year for wind energy growth, with the ""industry increasingly pushing into new regions.""

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, disputed the idea that smart countries don't use wind power. China is soaring ahead in building a massive amount of wind power while Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Sweden, France and many other countries in Europe have large programs of wind construction, he said Wednesday.

""By cutting back on wind power development, the U.S. is ceding the lead to China in this important technology, and killing a lot of U.S. jobs,"" Gerrard said in an e-mail.

CLAIM: In New England, two whales washed up over 50 years, ""and last summer they had 14 washed up. Now, I'm not saying that's the wind farm that was built, that maybe it is right.""

THE FACTS: There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA says it analyzes the causes of death whenever possible, following the science and data. Unfounded claims about offshore wind threatening whales have surfaced as a flashpoint in the fight over the future of renewable energy.

The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm officially opened in 2024 east of Montauk Point, New York. The nation's second-largest offshore wind farm is under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. A five-turbine pilot project has been operating since 2016 off the coast of Rhode Island.

CLAIM: ""The birds are dying all over the place.""

THE FACTS: Turbines, like all infrastructure, can pose a risk to birds. However, the National Audubon Society, which is dedicated to the conservation of birds, thinks developers can manage these risks and climate change is a greater threat. An Audubon report found that two-thirds of North American bird species could face extinction due to rising temperatures.

In January, the nonprofit said responsible offshore wind development is a clear win for birds, the U.S. economy and the climate.

""While persistent myths claim widespread and devastating effects of offshore wind turbines on wildlife, the science tells a different story. Our findings clearly indicate that we can responsibly deploy offshore wind in a manner that still protects birds and their habitats,"" Sam Wojcicki, Audubon's senior director for climate policy, wrote in a January post. The organization also supports wind energy on land when it is sited and operated properly to minimize the impact on birds and other wildlife.

CLAIM: ""You can't take them down because the environmentalists don't let you bury the blades.""

THE FACTS: Wind turbine blades are challenging to recycle. They are designed for durability to withstand hurricane-force winds. However, the U.S. already has the ability to recycle most wind turbine materials, according to the Department of Energy. It issued a report in January that found 90% of wind turbines can be recycled using existing infrastructure, while new strategies and innovative recycling methods will be needed to tackle the rest.

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue. Danish wind energy developer rsted committed in 2021 to never sending turbine blades to landfill, instead reusing, recycling or otherwise recovering them.

The Japanese automakerNissan Raises $4.5 Billion to Ease Debt Pressure as EV Plans Slow Down has secured $4.5 billion through a fresh bond sale in U.S. dollars and euros, aiming to buy itself time and space to manage a growing pile of debt.

The funds will help Nissan refinance around ¥700 billion (roughly $4.76 billion) in debt due this fiscal year. It’s a necessary move for a company that’s facing rising costs, a tougher EV market, and a recent downgrade to “junk” status by all three major credit agencies.

Borrowing Now, Breathing Room Later

According to a term sheet seen by Reuters, Nissan issued three dollar-denominated bond tranches worth $3 billion, alongside two euro tranches totaling €1.3 billion ($1.52 billion). The bonds stretch over four to ten years, with interest rates between 7.5% and 8.125% — higher than usual, but expected for a company under pressure.

For Nissan, this isn’t just about numbers, it’s about regaining financial footing after a few difficult years.

EV Plans Postponed as Caution Sets In

Nissan’s ambitions in the electric vehicle space are being quietly scaled back, especially in North America. Two new electric SUVs, one for Nissan, the other for its luxury brand Infiniti — were supposed to roll out of its Mississippi plant by 2028. That timeline has now slipped to late 2028 or even 2029.

It’s a reflection of the bigger picture: EV demand isn’t as hot as it once seemed. Policy shifts in the U.S., especially the rollback of key tax credits and the introduction of a 25% tariff on vehicle exports to Canada, are making things even more complicated. In response, Nissan has pulled two EVs from its U.S. lineup and halted Canadian shipments altogether.

Holding Tight to Cash

To conserve money, Nissan has reportedly asked some of its suppliers to delay payments — a tough ask that hints at internal cash flow concerns. At the same time, its battery partner AESC has paused work on a new factory in South Carolina. That site was meant to support Nissan’s EV production, but with plans now in flux, the construction has been put on hold.

These choices aren’t easy, but they show a company trying to stay afloat while recalibrating its path forward.

Investors Still Hopeful, For Now

Interestingly, retail investors are staying optimistic. Social platform Stocktwits reported a spike in discussions about Nissan, with sentiment labeled “bullish” and message volume marked “extremely high.” Whether this is grounded in confidence or just speculation remains to be seen.

A Company at the Crossroads

Nissan’s story right now is about survival but also resilience. It’s juggling short-term financial fixes while rewriting long-term plans in a shifting industry. The $4.5 billion it just raised doesn’t solve everything, but it gives the automaker breathing room to regroup.

For a company once seen as an EV pioneer, the road ahead is uncertain, but not closed.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NISSAN-RESTRUCTURING-0_1747051237324_1747051249381.jpeg,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:40.120845
