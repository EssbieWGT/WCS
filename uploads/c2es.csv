— Delivers rapid, durable responses in wAIHA, the more common form of this potentially life-threatening disease —

HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“ HUTCHMED ”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that the Phase III registration part of the ESLIM-02 clinical trial of sovleplenib, a novel spleen tyrosine kinase (“Syk”) inhibitor, in adult patients with warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (“wAIHA”) in China has met its primary endpoint of durable hemoglobin (Hb) response rate within weeks 5 to 24 of treatment.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (“AIHA”) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (“RBCs”) due to the production of antibodies against RBC. The incidence of AIHA is estimated to be 0.8-3.0/100,000 adults per year with an estimated prevalence of 17 per 100,000 adults and a death rate of 8-11%. 1 , 2 wAIHA is the most common form of AIHA, 3 accounting for about 75-80% of all adult AIHA cases. 4

ESLIM-02 is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled China Phase II/III study in adult patients with primary or secondary wAIHA who had relapsed or were refractory to at least one prior line of standard treatment. Results from the Phase II part of the study published in The Lancet Haematology in January 2025 demonstrated encouraging hemoglobin benefit compared with placebo, with overall response rate of 43.8% vs 0% in the first 8 weeks, and overall response rate of 66.7% during the 24 weeks of sovleplenib treatment (including patients that crossed over from placebo) with a favorable safety profile. 5 Additional details may be found at clinicaltrials.gov , using identifier NCT05535933 .

Professor Fengkui Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Blood Diseases Hospital , and one of the leading principal investigators of the ESLIM-02 study, said: “Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a highly heterogeneous and often chronically relapsing disease. Patients often experience symptoms like fatigue significantly impacting patients’ quality of life. In severe cases, the disease can become life-threatening if not managed effectively. The positive topline results from ESLIM-02 highlight sovleplenib's potential to deliver rapid and durable hemoglobin responses in wAIHA patients who have limited options after failing standard therapies. This could represent a meaningful advancement for managing this challenging condition.”

Professor Bin Han of Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Professor Lianshan Zhang of The Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were also co-leading Principal Investigators of the study. Full results of the ESLIM-02 study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference. HUTCHMED plans to submit the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for sovleplenib for wAIHA to the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in the first half of 2026.

About Sovleplenib and wAIHA

Sovleplenib is a novel, investigational, selective small molecule inhibitor for oral administration targeting the spleen tyrosine kinase, also known as Syk. Syk is a major component in B-cell receptor and Fc receptor signaling and is an established target for the treatment of multiple subtypes of B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune disorders.

The accelerated clearance of antibody-coated RBCs by immunoglobulin Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) bearing macrophages is thought to be the pathogenic mechanism in wAIHA. 6 Activated Syk mediates downstream signaling of the activated Fc receptors in phagocytic cells, resulting in phagocytosis of RBCs. 7 In addition, activation of Syk through the B-cell receptor mediates activation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes into antibody secreting plasma cells. 8 Inhibition of Syk may have potential effects in the treatment of wAIHA through inhibition of phagocytosis and reduction of antibody production.

In addition to wAIHA, sovleplenib is also being studied in immune thrombocytopenia (“ITP”). Positive results from ESLIM-01 (NCT05029635), a Phase III trial in China of sovleplenib in patients with primary ITP, have been published in The Lancet Haematology . An NDA resubmission for sovleplenib for second-line ITP is planned in the first half of 2026.

HUTCHMED currently retains all rights to sovleplenib worldwide.

About HUTCHMED

HUTCHMED (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) is an innovative, commercial-stage, biopharmaceutical company. It is committed to the discovery and global development and commercialization of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases.

The Appropriations Committee has long sought to operate in a bipartisan and collaborative manner, and with today’s package, we fulfill that longstanding commitment.
Today’s package is the second step forward in finishing our twelve funding bills for fiscal year 2026.
In November, we enacted into law our first three-bill package.
With passage of these three measures, we will have full-year funding in place for many of our most crucial programs.","Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member McGovern, and esteemed members of the Rules Committee, I thank you for your warm welcome and your kind invitation to testify today.

I appear before you today on H.R. 6938, a three-bill package covering the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment appropriations measures for fiscal year 2026.

Today’s bills are the result of a bipartisan and bicameral negotiation. As such, they are a compromise product, with buy-in from members of both parties and in both chambers of Congress. The Appropriations Committee has long sought to operate in a bipartisan and collaborative manner, and with today’s package, we fulfill that longstanding commitment. The end result is a reminder for us all that consensus – not partisan obstruction – is not only possible, it is preferable.

Today’s package is the second step forward in finishing our twelve funding bills for fiscal year 2026. In November, we enacted into law our first three-bill package. Today, we build on the momentum of what we accomplished then. In the coming weeks, I look forward to appearing before you again on additional packages, with the goal of completing all fiscal year 2026 funding by the January 30 deadline.

With passage of these three measures, we will have full-year funding in place for many of our most crucial programs. The Department of Justice will be able to fulfill its important mission protecting Americans from wrongdoers, including combating illicit drugs like the scourge of fentanyl. We prioritize American energy dominance and safeguarding critical mineral resources. National parks will be open and operating, and essential wildfire protection programs will remain in place. Other vital public safety programs like the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, will likewise continue to serve the American people. The Army Corps of Engineers will continue its important work of water development and flood control, as will the Department of Energy’s critical programs, including maintenance of our nuclear weapons stockpile.

I could go on and on, but I think the Committee sees the point: this three-bill package provides funding for countless critical programs that assist Americans every single day of the year. All three measures also include member-requested community project funding, ensuring that Congress maintains control over the power of the purse, and allowing members and communities to address their most pressing needs.

Perhaps what is most important is what this package does not do. In moving this process forward, we avoided an omnibus spending package at the Christmas holidays, an outcome that was a high priority for many members, including myself. And we accomplished this by negotiating these bills at the committee level, thereby taking another strong step toward returning the appropriations process to regular order.

I thank each of you for your time – and look forward to your questions today.",https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/appropriations.house.gov/files/favicon_1.ico,N,,2026-01-06 20:59:25.995946

The court’s order dismissing the cases as moot follows Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s agreement to withdraw from the multi-state climate compact as part of his deal with Republican state lawmakers to bring the five-month budget stalemate to a close in November.

It also came more than six months after the state’s highest court heard oral arguments in the cases in May.

While many who opposed the program said it would drive up energy costs and constitute a drag on the economy, environmentalists argued a well-designed carbon cap program would reduce climate warming emissions while generating billions of dollars for the commonwealth.

The initiative, which is ongoing in 11 states, requires major carbon dioxide emitters, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, to purchase carbon credits in an auction. Money from the credits is invested in sustainable energy projects in the states.

Challengers argued Pennsylvania’s membership in the program violated the state constitution.

They claimed Gov. Tom Wolf overstepped his executive authority by entering into the agreement without approval from the General Assembly and the cost of carbon credits constituted an illegal tax.

Siding with challengers, the Commonwealth Court ruled in November 2023 that to pass constitutional muster, Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI “may only be achieved through legislation duly enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.”

In a series of eight orders, the Supreme Court dismissed appeals by Constellation Energy, Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, Clean Air Council, the Sierra Club. It also dismissed appeals by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Quality Board, which issued the regulations establishing RGGI in the commonwealth.

The commonwealth entered the compact during Wolf’s administration in April 2022 when the final regulation was published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as required by state law.

Pennsylvania joined neighboring states New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware in RGGI more than three years after the regulatory process first began and after considerable bipartisan pushback from opponents who said Wolf’s decision to join the multi-state agreement was an example of executive overreach.

In arguments before the seven-member Supreme Court last spring, environmental groups argued the state constitution guarantees the protection of public resources including clean air and that the DEP’s plan to limit carbon emissions is constitutional because it is part of its program to protect the public’s environmental rights.

Leaders in the House and Senate could not agree on a general operating budget in 2025. With the chambers divided over the state’s planned income tax cuts and how much to increase pay for state workers and teachers, they left town with negotiations in a holding pattern until this year’s short session.

In the meantime, much of state government has been running on a continuation of the 2024 budget. Republican legislative leaders say that level of funding is adequate, but agency heads on both sides of the aisle disagree.

Democratic Secretary of State Elaine Marshall told the governor and other members of the council that more than 172,000 new businesses were created in North Carolina last year, nearly 10,000 more than in 2024.

While the growth has been remarkable, Marshall said on Tuesday, it was disappointing that her calls for additional personnel within the agency have fallen on deaf ears at the legislature.

“I sat at this very seat in August of ’23 asking the General Assembly for help,” said Marshall. “Two years later, that help has still not come. This is now our second year without a new state budget.”

The workload at the Secretary of State’s office has essentially doubled since 2017, yet staffing levels have remained largely unchanged, Marshall said. The agency has implemented technology improvements to manage a flood of new filings, but technology alone cannot solve every issue.

“People are essential,” said Marshall.

But Marshall said her employees are the second lowest paid employees in state government.

“We’ve consistently communicated to the General Assembly leadership the need for additional staff positions. While there’s growing awareness on Jones Street, the reality remains that there has been no budget,” she said.

State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, a Republican, joined Marshall in criticizing the failure of lawmakers to address the state’s budgetary needs.

Causey said his department’s team of 50 criminal investigators was called to investigate more than 7,600 cases of possible insurance fraud in 2025.

“Last year, these teams made 380 arrests,” said Causey. “We’re still only scratching the surface when it comes to fighting fraud.”

From 2017 to 2025, the Department of Insurance recovered over $76.6 million for people who were victimized by insurance fraud, according to the commissioner.

“I don’t think there’s an agency here that couldn’t use more staffing,” said Causey. “But both the Senate and the House, when they came out with their proposed budgets, were asking us as a self-funded agency to cut 20 positions or $2 million from our budget at a time when we need to be adding that many [positions] or more.”

Governor Josh Stein empathized with both agency heads and echoed their call for state legislators to get moving and pass a comprehensive budget that should have been in place last July.

“We have public safety officers who are not paid well. We have teachers who are earning less money on a real basis today than they were a year ago,” lamented Stein.

The governor noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in per-pupil spending and 50th in the country in terms of funding effort of K-12 education.

“These are numbers in which we can take no pride,” said Stein. “The legislature needs to pass a budget. I’m at the table ready to get to work whenever they are.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marshall_1-6-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:13:48.654545

Startup Noir NOLA works alongside partners such as The Idea Village, Louisiana Economic Development, Corridor Ventures, Camelback Ventures, and JPMorgan Chase.
Startup Noir NOLA seeks to change that.
One early milestone came during New Orleans Entrepreneur Week, where Startup Noir NOLA hosted its first summit.
Recently, Startup Noir NOLA launched a Supper Club to give founders space to speak openly about barriers and opportunities within the ecosystem.","Startup Noir NOLA emerged during a pivotal moment for New Orleans’ startup economy. In 2021, two major exits — including Louisiana’s first unicorn — signaled a turning point, showing that billion-dollar outcomes could happen locally. That momentum sparked new companies, attracted investment, and brought renewed attention to the region’s growing innovation landscape.

Recognizing the significance of that shift, GNO Inc.’s Chief External Affairs Officer, Jasmine Brown-DeRousselle, created Startup Noir NOLA to ensure Black founders could fully participate in — and help shape — the region’s growth. The initiative builds on New Orleans’ existing strengths: a high concentration of Black residents with entrepreneurial talent, a cluster of HBCUs producing skilled graduates, and a creative culture shaped by generations of Black innovators. Paired with a startup support network that is expanding and becoming more coordinated, the region is increasingly suited for founders looking to launch and scale here.

Workforce & Entrepreneurship Manager Salem Habte, who leads the initiative, notes that the program’s name is intentional and direct.

“It’s very literal in name! It conveys who this initiative is intended to serve,” she said.

That clarity is central to the mission: elevating Black-led startups in Greater New Orleans and expanding the resources available to them.

Startup Noir NOLA works alongside partners such as The Idea Village, Louisiana Economic Development, Corridor Ventures, Camelback Ventures, and JPMorgan Chase. The initiative aims not only to address persistent gaps but also to strengthen what New Orleans has historically done well. The city has a long history of entrepreneurship — from some of the nation’s earliest Black self-made millionaires to one of the highest percentages of Black-owned businesses in the country today. But data continues to show an imbalance.

“Access to capital and customers remain the top challenges Black startup founders here face,” Habte said.

Despite strong ideas and growing companies, BIPOC-led firms are still less likely to receive traditional loans or venture funding, slowing both business development and the region’s broader economic potential.

Startup Noir NOLA seeks to change that. Its work focuses primarily on founders who have already gained traction and need targeted support to reach their next milestone.

“We’re now rolling out programs to attract outside startup capital and assist with access to it within the ecosystem,” Habte said.

By helping founders reach new customer segments and prepare for growth, the initiative accelerates their progress toward major goals, including future funding and business expansion.

One early milestone came during New Orleans Entrepreneur Week, where Startup Noir NOLA hosted its first summit. The event drew more than 100 attendees and featured conversations on the state of Black entrepreneurship, founder wellness, and strategies to encourage more high-net-worth individuals to become investors. It also included a fireside chat with Erik Moore, founder of Base Venture Partners. The response underscored a long-standing need.

“I heard repeatedly, ‘FINALLY! Conversations centered around our experience,’” Habte said.

The summit is set to return to NOEW in March 2026.

Capital access remains a central focus. Because many investors in major markets tend to “fly over” the Gulf South when sourcing deals, Startup Noir NOLA launched a familiarization tour to bring interested investors directly to New Orleans. Ten representatives from venture capital funds, angel groups, and a CDFI participated. The day highlighted local Black founders in biotech, beauty, and music technology, while offering investors a deeper look at the city’s strengths.

“We aimed to help them understand our city’s history, areas of excellence, and most importantly, introduce them to local Black entrepreneurs that are raising capital for their companies,” Habte said.

The impact was immediate: founders began receiving follow-ups, and several investors started conducting diligence on companies they met during the tour. Habte believes this is the start of deeper engagement.

Another key piece of the initiative is community building. Recently, Startup Noir NOLA launched a Supper Club to give founders space to speak openly about barriers and opportunities within the ecosystem. Each dinner is co-hosted by a founder or funder who helps guide the conversation. It’s part of creating an environment where founders feel supported and heard. Habte envisions a future where New Orleans becomes a national model for Black innovation.

“We see a future where this city births a new paradigm for Black entrepreneurship,” she said. “In New Orleans, it should not only be possible to scale your company, but advantageous to do so.”

Looking ahead, Startup Noir NOLA has an ambitious slate of programs planned for 2026. In January, the initiative will host masterclasses designed to help founders strengthen their supply chains, secure working capital, and reach new customer bases. The investor tour, Venture Voir, will also return with a new cohort of visitors. Throughout this expansion, the initiative remains open and accessible.

“If you are a Black startup founder, please reach out so we can talk about your work and goals,” Habte said. “If you are an entrepreneurial supporter passionate about this mission, I’d love to get you involved.”",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/01/SNN_01.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:58:36.217277

The project in question, known as Cactus Wren BESS, will have up to 800MW/3,200MWh of capacity on approximately 40 acres of land located around 7.6 miles south of the City of Maricopa in Pinal County, Arizona.

Interconnection to the electricity grid will be achieved via Salt River Project’s (SRP’s) Duke 500kV substation that’s located to the north of the project amongst three other substations.

Shortlisted for procurement

Also present at the recent meeting was SRP’s director for local relations, Buchanan Davis, who revealed that the project has been shortlisted for procurement by the utility.

“We are in active discussions with the developer as we explore a potential energy storage agreement,” said Davis.

The success of the project was described by Davis as being important for both SRP and Pinal County, especially with the utility predicting a 12% growth in annual energy usage across the county during the next decade.

SRP attributes this increasing demand to population growth and hotter summers, but also points to further industrial developments in the area – particularly where data centers are concerned.

Just last month, Pinal County’s BoS approved a data center development from Copia Power that will feature a BESS, known as the Energy Generation and Technology Campus, that will be located adjacent to esVolta’s recent BESS proposal.

As well as SRP, the project is also being considered for procurement by public utility Electric District No. 3 (ED3), which described the project as being located in an “ideal location.” According to a letter of support for the project, ED3 has requested pricing for a portion of Cactus Wren BESS which will be evaluated as part of the utility’s power procurement process.

After little discussion amongst the BoS, esVolta’s three requests were approved unanimously.

Construction is expected to take around 12 months to complete, with esVolta aiming to break ground sometime next year.

“We are pleased to work in partnership with Call2Recycle to launch an extended producer responsibility program for batteries,” Recycle NB CEO Tim LeBlanc says. ""Call2Recycle is planning to significantly expand its network of battery drop-off locations that were already established in New Brunswick through its voluntary program, leading to greater diversion rates for our provincial landfills and a cleaner, safer environment.”

As the program ramps up, Call2Recycle says New Brunswick residents will have access to drop-off options and collection events, public education and outreach initiatives and bilingual resources for English and French speakers.

“This initiative helps strengthens our overarching commitment to environmental protection,” Environment and Climate Change Minister Gilles LePage says. “By aligning with the objectives of our Strategic Action Plan for Solid Waste Management, it enhances our collective capacity to reduce waste, promote responsible resource use and advance sustainable practices. Together, these efforts reinforce a cohesive, integrated approach to safeguarding the environment while achieving the long-term goals established for effective and responsible waste management.”

Since its inception, Call2Recycle has collected more than 55 million kilograms of batteries across Canada. The organization says that expanding to New Brunswick further strengthens its impact by increasing end-of-life options for consumer batteries and helping prevent potential safety risks associated with improper storage or disposal. Call2Recycle promotes the safe handling and transport of used batteries, including taping lithium-based batteries and bagging them individually before drop-off.

“This program supports New Brunswick’s environmental ambitions by making battery recycling easy for families and businesses across the province,” Zenobio says. “Together with our retail and municipal partners, we’re bringing New Brunswickers a reliable, provincewide solution that keeps batteries out of landfills and valuable materials in circulation.”",https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/fileuploads/image/2026/01/06/batteries---dimaberlin.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:13:54.716516

AI developers state that they are targeting colder climate areas to reduce the amount of energy needed to operate these data centers. Addressing the energy needs, employment promises and overall environmental impact of data centers will allow South Dakotans to decide whether we really want this infrastructure to be developed in our state. We live here, and our voices matter.

Politicians and data center developers are downplaying the massive energy requirements that the proposed data centers will demand. Approximately 400 megawatts of power from our electric grids could be needed for one data center, consuming half of the energy that South Dakota has spent over 75 years sizing up to sustain the expanding population and economic growth we are seeing today.

Congressman speaks in support of data centers in SD, calling anti-development rhetoric ‘un-American’

These massive data centers are filled with computers to store AI and cryptocurrency data, and computers generate a lot of heat. To avoid overheating and ensure proper functioning, large amounts of water are needed to cool the systems down. Some data center developers claim that water usage for the proposed data centers here will be no more than that of the average U.S. household. However, our cold season does come to an end, and as temperatures continue to rise and display record summer highs year after year, these claims will become less valid. There is already a strain on our water resources here in South Dakota, so potential water shortages could result if the issue is aggravated.

Furthermore, claims that the demand on our energy grid will not increase our already rising energy bills are sugarcoated at best. Americans have seen about a 13% national increase in electricity prices since the beginning of 2025, and this trend is expected to continue.

Transparency is a must when it comes to grandiose promises, such as the statements that data centers will create substantial job growth for South Dakotans. While the construction of these large buildings will bring temporary employment, once construction ends, so will most of these jobs. Also, the construction of a data center requires highly skilled workers. We can’t be sure that out-of-state companies won’t be brought in for the construction.

On average, an operating data center needs between 30 and 100 full-time employees. There is currently no data to show how the hundreds of jobs promised compare to the jobs that are actually created, or what kind of jobs those even are.

Data centers also bring a slew of environmental problems in their wake. As stated previously, they will consume a large amount of water. We’re talking hundreds of thousands to millions of gallons of water per day for an evaporative-cooled system in the data center. On the low end, this water usage is equivalent to the needs of a city the size of Pierre. On the high end of consumption, it would be more comparable to the water needs of Sioux Falls. There is technology that operates on a closed-loop system where the water is cooled and recycled. However, this could increase the electricity demand by more than 20% and further burden our fragile energy grid, contributing to ratepayers’ increased energy costs.

The message is clear — communities need to have transparency around proposed data centers so they can weigh the economic and environmental impacts in order to protect hardworking South Dakotans and our beautiful lands. These impacts must be weighed against proposals to bestow tax rebates on the billion-dollar companies building these data centers (Google, Meta, Amazon).

More factual information regarding the jobs promised, the electrical and water usage, and environmental risks needs to be brought forward and discussed before any construction begins. Finding ways to mitigate the environmental and economic effects that are correlated with data centers should be a top priority for South Dakotans as we take a stand to protect our communities.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47647/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2212150245-scaled-1-1024x6821767741116.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=mGl1SUhH,N,,2026-01-06 22:58:22.809729

Cure with Confidence: Tools and Models for Resin Process Control

The performance of the final product depends heavily on the degree of cure - making it critical to ensure that the reaction goes to completion for the highest quality and reliability. Achieving this requires both a deep understanding of the resin’s curing behavior and precise control of process parameters. Tools such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dielectric analysis (DEA) and oscillatory rheometry provide powerful ways to characterize thermal transitions, cure progression and flow behavior. Each method delivers distinct insights. In this presentation, NETZSCH will discuss when to use DSC, DEA or oscillatory rheometry. These techniques also serve as the basis for kinetics analysis using Kinetics Neo software. Kinetics modeling allows simulation of resin behavior under any time or temperature conditions. This not only enables process optimization and consistent product performance but also helps reduce manufacturing variability and thus scrap rates by predicting and preventing potential processing issues. Agenda: Comparative use of DSC, DEA and oscillatory rheometry in thermoset cure characterization Kinetic modeling approaches for curing processes The role of vitrification as a critical parameter in cure analysis

UV Curing for Composite Manufacturing

Ultraviolet energy (UV) curing, also known as energy curing, has been used by the composites industry for some time, but it is still not quite as well-known as some other curing chemistries. The extremely rapid cure speed leads to high throughput and productivity, while the breath of physical properties of the cured resins allow them to be used in a variety of applications. The possibility of making lower VOC/styrene free formulations with very long pot life and reduced waste are also benefits of UV technology. In this presentation, allnex will briefly review what UV curing entails and compare the advantages and challenges of energy curing with thermally curing technologies (for example, peroxide curing of UP resins). In addition to comparing the chemistry of these approaches, we will also look at which composite manufacturing methods best lend themselves to energy curing.

“Coloradans want access to clean energy technology to save money, and these rebates will help accomplish that,” Gov.","Coloradans begin 2026 with fewer options for how to pay for clean energy home upgrades after lucrative tax credits ended well before their initial expiration date.

The programs were part of a suite of clean energy initiatives enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a sprawling climate and health law passed by congressional Democrats and championed by former President Joe Biden.

Included in the Inflation Reduction Act was the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which provided up to $3,200 in tax credits for heat pumps, water heaters and biomass stoves and boilers, as well as home efficiency measures such as air sealing, insulation, new doors and windows. Another tax credit program, the Residential Clean Energy Credit, covered 30% of the cost of solar installation for a home.

The initiatives were meant to incentivize consumers to move away from fossil fuels and, when paired with the Inflation Reduction Act’s other climate measures, were projected to help cut U.S. carbon emissions by approximately 40% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Both tax credit programs expired on Dec. 31, however. The subsidies were supposed to last through 2032, but they were eliminated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed earlier this year by congressional Republicans and signed into law by President Donald Trump.

That law also ended another tax credit program for new and used electric vehicles on Sept. 30.

But even without those incentives, Coloradans still have options for subsidies for a host of clean energy appliances.

$14,000 worth of rebates for home upgrades

In November, the state launched the Home Energy Rebate Program , which provides income-qualified Coloradans with up to $14,000 in discounts for electric energy appliances and home efficiency upgrades.

“Coloradans want access to clean energy technology to save money, and these rebates will help accomplish that,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement announcing the program. “These rebates can help more Coloradans make a variety of home upgrades that will bring down energy costs and provide more efficient home heating and cooling.”

The funding comes from federal money that was preserved in the Inflation Reduction Act, with Colorado receiving just over $140 million to launch its program. The rebates are expected to be available through 2029, or until funding runs out.

Under the program, Coloradans could be eligible for:

Up to $8,000 for a cold climate heat pump for space heating or cooling

Up to $4,000 for a breaker box upgrade

Up to $2,500 for electric wiring

Up to $1,750 for a heat pump water heater

Up to $1,600 for insulation, air sealing and ventilation

Up to $840 for an electric stove, cooktop, oven or heat pump clothes dryer

The rebates are income-based. Households making below 80% of their county’s area median income are eligible to receive the full amount, while those making between 80% and 150% could see up to half.

The subsidies are available for both homeowners who work with a state-registered contractor and renters who have permission from their property owner. More program information, including a list of eligible contractors, income limits, and how to apply, can be found at EnergyOffice.Colorado.gov/home-energy-rebates .

State officials have touted the subsidies as a way of not only lowering home energy costs but also reducing carbon emissions and improving indoor air quality. Colorado has a goal of reaching 100% net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, relative to 2005 levels, by 2050.

“Burning fossil fuels in buildings, such as for heating and water heating, is among the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Colorado,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, in a statement.

“These incentives will make innovative and efficient technologies that improve home health and safety more affordable, and will save people money on their energy bills, while playing a key role in achieving our climate goals,” Toor said, adding that the new rebates are the “biggest home energy incentives the state has offered to date.

Coloradans also have the opportunity to pair those rebates with other existing clean home energy programs. More information on that can be found at PUC.Colorado.gov/energy-savings .

Western Slope-specific programs

In Colorado’s mountain communities, where energy costs can be much higher, local and regional initiatives exist to help households pay for home upgrades.

The Carbondale-based nonprofit Energy Smart Colorado partners with local governments and groups to offer programs in more than a dozen western Colorado counties, including Summit, Grand, Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield and Routt.

Eligible households can receive a subsidized home energy assessment and rebates for solar installation and electrical appliances. Benefits differ by county, and more information can be found at EnergySmartColorado.org .

Boosted EV rebates

After Congress ended tax credits worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles on Sept. 30, Colorado officials increased state-level EV rebates.

The state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program provides rebates for Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid.

As of Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle have increased from $6,000 to $9,000 for new cars, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones. More information can be found at EnergyOffice.colorado.gov/vehicle-exchange-colorado .

Colorado also has its own tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, was reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting in 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

While the rebate program is somewhat insulated from budget pressures since its funding is derived from fees on package and food delivery services, the state’s electric vehicle tax credit is directly tied to available tax revenue.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/7/2026/01/06155938/Solar.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 19:00:05.434971

Changes to PFAS reporting requirements The EPA is also working to roll back some PFAS reporting requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act, reporting that was called for in a 2023 rule (PDF).
A final rule that closely resembles the proposed rule will likely emerge in the first half of 2026, she tells C&EN.
“The tsunami of state PFAS reporting obligations shows no sign of abating.” With attention focused on midterm elections in 2026, legislative and regulatory action will likely slow down at the federal level.
“Every single state at some point is going to be enacting, if it has not already, reporting obligations and/or product restrictions on PFAS.”","The US Environmental Protection Agency begins 2026 amid a move to rescind drinking water standards for four types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), along with other ongoing actions on these “forever chemicals.” Policy and regulation experts tell C&EN that we may see less new federal action on PFAS this year but that litigation and state action show no signs of slowing down.

Asked about this effort and other agency priorities regarding PFAS in 2026, an EPA spokesperson wrote to C&EN, “The Trump EPA is committed to addressing PFAS with gold-standard science to ensure that Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water, carrying out our core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

The federal drinking water standards for the four PFAS were established in 2024 as part of a package that also limits perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).

Water utility groups have sued the EPA over these standards. The EPA will defend the limits on PFOA and PFOS but has asked the court in this case to annul the limits for the other four chemicals: perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA).

The 2024 regulation came amid a groundswell of awareness about PFAS.

“It’s not new to people that PFAS are a problem, but I think what has really grown, say in the last decade, is awareness of how widespread the issue is,” says Alissa Cordner, an environmental sociology professor at Whitman College who coleads the PFAS Project Lab. “We have seen a pretty dramatic increase in legislation and regulation,” she tells C&EN.

If the EPA succeeds in rolling back some of the drinking-water standards, Cordner expects opposing litigation.

Meanwhile, controversy over the exact definition of PFAS will continue. “The question of what counts as a PFAS is really top of mind for people on all sides of the issue,” she says.

Changes to PFAS reporting requirements

The EPA is also working to roll back some PFAS reporting requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act, reporting that was called for in a 2023 rule (PDF). In November, the EPA proposed changes to that rule, most notably for imports of certain PFAS-containing products, such as textiles, cookware, electronics, and car parts, to be exempt from reporting requirements.

“There was a considerable sigh of relief” from industry, says Lynn Bergeson, an attorney and managing partner of the Bergeson & Campbell law firm.

A final rule that closely resembles the proposed rule will likely emerge in the first half of 2026, she tells C&EN.

But companies’ preparations for the Joe Biden–era rule “will not be for naught,” she adds, because states are also creating new requirements. “The tsunami of state PFAS reporting obligations shows no sign of abating.”

With attention focused on midterm elections in 2026, legislative and regulatory action will likely slow down at the federal level. “I would expect there to be PFAS initiatives, but maybe not as robust or as numerous as in other years, because politics is everything,” Bergeson says.

But at the state level, she expects momentum to continue. “States have picked up on a sense that the federal government has retreated a little bit from limiting and restricting PFAS and have really rushed to fill a perceived void,” she says. “Every single state at some point is going to be enacting, if it has not already, reporting obligations and/or product restrictions on PFAS.”","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/WCO--PFAS-actions-by-EPA---274048:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2026-01-06 19:00:20.698467

The acquisition includes three combined cycle gas turbine facilities and two combustion turbine facilities located across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland; four combined cycle gas turbine facilities in New England, and one ERCOT cogeneration facility in Texas.
The $4 billion net purchase price implies a multiple of about 7.25x the 2027 expected Adjusted EBITDA contribution and about $730/kW for the portfolio, Vistra said.
“The addition of this natural gas portfolio is a great way to start another year of growth for Vistra as we’ve completed, acquired, or developed projects in each of the competitive power regions where we operate.
“We’re pleased to have reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the Cogentrix portfolio to Vistra,” said Wil VanLoh, founder and CEO of Quantum Capital Group.","Irving-based Vistra Corp. has agreed to acquire Cogentrix Energy, consisting of 10 modern natural gas generation facilities totaling approximately 5,500 MW of capacity. Cogentrix is indirectly owned by funds managed by Quantum Capital Group.

The acquisition includes three combined cycle gas turbine facilities and two combustion turbine facilities located across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland; four combined cycle gas turbine facilities in New England, and one ERCOT cogeneration facility in Texas.

“The Vistra team is excited to announce the acquisition of the Cogentrix portfolio, marking the second opportunistic expansion of our generation footprint over the past year to support our ability to serve growing customer demand in our key markets,” Vistra President and CEO Jim Burke said in a statement. “Successfully integrating and operating generation assets is a major undertaking, and our talented team continues to demonstrate that it is a core competency of our company.”

(The earlier deal Burke referred to above was Vistra’s $1.9 billion May 2025 acquisition of seven gas-fired power plants from Greenwich, Connecticut-based Lotus Infrastructure Partners.)

Vistra will pay a net purchase price of approximately $4 billion, which includes around $2.3 billion in cash and around $900 million in Vistra stock (5 million shares of common stock at a mutually agreed-upon value of $185 per share) to be issued to Quantum, and the assumption of approximately $1.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness at Cogentrix, less approximately $700 million of net present value of expected tax benefits generated directly as a result of the transaction.

The consideration payable is also subject to certain customary net working capital, cash, and indebtedness adjustments. The $4 billion net purchase price implies a multiple of about 7.25x the 2027 expected Adjusted EBITDA contribution and about $730/kW for the portfolio, Vistra said.

Boosting diversification and growing the geographic footprint

“Our diversified fleet, anchored on natural gas and nuclear generation, will play a critical role in the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of U.S. power grids,” Burke said. “The addition of this natural gas portfolio is a great way to start another year of growth for Vistra as we’ve completed, acquired, or developed projects in each of the competitive power regions where we operate. Vistra continues to look for opportunities that allow us to meet the growing demand of customers and meet our disciplined investment thresholds.”

The Cogentrix portfolio is composed of a modern and efficient set of gas assets that adds baseload-weighted capacity, complements Vistra’s fleet, and enhances Vistra’s efficient generation capabilities, the company said. The acquisition also diversifies and expands Vistra’s geographic footprint by adding 5,500 MW of net capacity across some of the most attractive and fastest-growing power regions in North America.

“We’re pleased to have reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the Cogentrix portfolio to Vistra,” said Wil VanLoh, founder and CEO of Quantum Capital Group. “We’re excited to become shareholders of Vistra and have much confidence in Vistra’s ability to deliver long-term value through its industry-leading portfolio and operational excellence. Quantum thanks the Cogentrix team for their partnership and looks forward to seeing the business continue to grow as part of Vistra.”

Combined with its current fleet, Vistra’s generation portfolio will consist of approximately 50,000 MW of capacity across the U.S., stretching from Maine to California, the company said.

The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals, including by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and certain state regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in mid- to late 2026.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. is serving as exclusive financial advisor, and Latham & Watkins LLP, Sidley Austin, LLP, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP are serving as legal advisors, to Vistra.

The department announced contracts for three reactor fuel companies on Monday in an effort to undercut Russia’s dominance in the market for advanced reactor fuel.

The funding comes as electricity demand increases and federal policy shifts away from renewable energy development. The Trump administration is betting on a larger role for nuclear power in America’s energy future. But the U.S. relies heavily on imported fuel for its existing nuclear power plants, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the administration is “committed to restoring a secure domestic nuclear fuel supply chain capable of producing the nuclear fuels needed to power the reactors of today and the advanced reactors of tomorrow.”

What will the nuclear fuel be used for?

The Energy Department’s awards focus on two types of nuclear fuel: low-enriched uranium (LEU) and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Both are produced by enriching natural uranium to increase concentrations of uranium-235, the isotope that sustains fission reactions underpinning nuclear power plants. LEU powers the large commercial reactors currently operating in the United States. HALEU contains higher concentrations, enabling more efficient reactor designs such as small modular reactors.

Advanced reactors using HALEU can operate at higher temperatures than those at conventional plants, potentially improving efficiency and reducing waste. Many advanced designs are also smaller and more flexible, allowing deployment at remote communities, military bases and industrial facilities.

The HALEU enrichment effort is separate from another Trump administration initiative to make plutonium from decommissioned nuclear warheads available to the power industry. That plutonium would be used in conventional reactors, while HALEU is specifically designed for advanced reactor technologies.

While one U.S. company has produced HALEU, it’s not available at a commercial scale. Russia’s state-owned nuclear company Rosatom is one of the few sources of commercial HALEU supply, creating a dependency that Congress sought to address with a 2024 ban on Russian uranium imports.

How is the $2.7 billion distributed?

The Energy Department awarded $900 million each to three companies operating in the United States.

American Centrifuge Operating, a subsidiary of Centrus Energy, will develop domestic HALEU enrichment capacity at its facility in Piketon, Ohio. Centrus began producing HALEU in October 2023 under a previous department contract, becoming the only domestic source of the fuel.

General Matter will develop HALEU production using laser-based enrichment technology. The approach uses precise light frequencies to selectively excite and separate uranium isotopes.

Orano Federal Services will expand domestic LEU enrichment. Orano Federal Services is the U.S. subsidiary of France’s state-owned Orano Group. The company plans to build a new $5 billion enrichment facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Wright said the awards would be “distributed to the companies under a strict milestone approach,” requiring them to meet benchmarks before receiving payments.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1356860443_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 17:14:10.310279

Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa.
“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said.
Lane Witten, a vice president at NextEra, was chosen as one of 14 members to serve on the Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force.
Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump.","Efforts to expand nuclear energy in Iowa have kicked off in 2026 with the formation of a state nuclear energy task force and the Linn County approval of a rezoning request for Iowa’s sole nuclear plant’s planned restart.

The Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force, initiated by Gov. Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa.

Reynolds said in a news release the task force marks a “strategic step forward” to ensuring Iowa has a “safe, efficient, and responsible integration” of nuclear energy.

“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said. “With our strong foundation in manufacturing and energy innovation, we are uniquely positioned to lead the nation in developing and deploying nuclear technologies.”

Presently, Iowa has no operational nuclear energy plants, but NextEra Energy is working to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Linn County. The company’s request to rezone close to 400 acres at the site was approved by Linn County Supervisors Monday, though there are still several regulatory hurdles NextEra must cross to be operational at the start of 2029 as it plans.

The plant, if restarted, would generate 615 megawatts of energy and have more than 400 onsite, full-time jobs. Google signed an agreement with NextEra in October to purchase power from Duane Arnold nuclear site to power Google cloud and artificial intelligence operations.

Lane Witten, a vice president at NextEra, was chosen as one of 14 members to serve on the Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force.

The task force is chaired by Mark Nutt, a graduate of Iowa State University’s Nuclear Engineering program and the director of Nuclear Energy Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Other members represent utilities, local government, industry and the Iowa Utilities Commission.

State legislators Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny; Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines; Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter; Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, and Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, also serve on the task force.

According to the news release, the task force is asked to assess emerging nuclear technologies for Iowa’s energy sector, engage with industry leaders to help develop the necessary workforce for the industry, as well as engage with manufacturers and other stakeholders to identify potential barriers to entry in the nuclear field.

The task force is also asked to explore engagement opportunities with federal nuclear energy programs to “ensure Iowa’s policies and initiatives align with national regulations” and to evaluate opportunities for economic growth within the nuclear energy sector.

While energy consumption remained fairly stable across the U.S. from 2000-2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a recent report from the consulting firm ICF projected overall energy demand will increase by 25% by 2030. The report attributes the growth in part to data centers that power cloud and artificial intelligence models, as well as increased electrification in transportation and building sectors.

Reynolds has identified nuclear energy as one of her priorities to build an “affordable, reliable and sustainable energy system” for the state. The governor’s energy bill from the 2025 legislative session also called for the General Assembly to “encourage the development” of nuclear electric power generation, but the bill did not make it to the floor for debate in either chamber.

Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump. NextEra’s website for the Duane Arnold restart claims the project contributes “toward the Administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.”

According to the news release, the task force has 180 days to submit a final report on its findings and recommendations to the governor, per the executive order.

Additional task force members include:

May Farlinger, president of Alliant Energy’s Iowa company, Interstate Power & Light Company; Mike Fehr, senior vice president of renewable generation and compliance at MidAmerican Energy; Brandy Meisheid, chair of the Linn County Board of Supervisors; Jim McCalley, distinguished professor at Iowa State University; Sarah Martz, chair of the Iowa Utilities Commission; Matt Resor, business manager for IBEW Local 405, and Andy Roberts with Central Iowa Building & Construction Trades Council.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2177851416-2048x1535.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 17:14:14.261154

The public-interest balancing test does not consider whether a project’s economic activity could be used to overcome disproportionate health impacts.
Though other New Jersey environmental laws balanced economic growth against public or environmental health, the Environmental Justice Law did not, the three-judge panel found.
Rules requiring reviews for expansions at existing facilities — including ones that do not alter a facility’s physical footprint — are not overbroad because those expansions could still strain public health, the court said.
He said it is too early to say whether his clients would petition the New Jersey Supreme Court for an appeal.","Environmentalists are cheering after a New Jersey appellate court upheld controversial new state environmental regulations and rejected a challenge from scrap recyclers and a labor union that alleged regulators had acted arbitrarily and exceeded their statutory authority.

The court’s Monday decision will keep in place, for now, the landmark New Jersey law that requires additional environmental reviews for projects in overburdened communities and allows the Department of Environmental Protection to block those projects if they would disproportionally worsen public health there.

“Today’s decision was a win for all New Jersey residents, but primarily for the environmental justice communities that have long championed this fight. When our environmental laws protect our most vulnerable communities, they protect us all,” said Casandia Bellevue, an attorney with Earthjustice, which represented supporters of the law.

Plastic pellets known as ‘nurdles’ are polluting beaches and waterways

Some business groups lamented the decision. Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the environmental rules “have had, and will continue to have, a chilling effect on New Jersey’s business community.”

The law is meant to limit further contamination in parts of New Jersey that historically saw significant pollution during the state’s industrial era, though provisions allow some projects to continue based on public need or mitigation technology approved by regulators.

The public-interest balancing test does not consider whether a project’s economic activity could be used to overcome disproportionate health impacts. The New Jersey branch of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries and the Engineers Labor Employer Cooperative Local 825 argued that excluding economic gains from the test is impermissibly arbitrary because a better economy could boost education and employment levels, reducing public health stressors.

But the court agreed with state officials who said economic benefits are difficult to quantify while reviewing a project’s application, adding that they cannot enforce promises of economic growth.

Though other New Jersey environmental laws balanced economic growth against public or environmental health, the Environmental Justice Law did not, the three-judge panel found.

“It is clear from the Legislature’s intent in [the Environmental Justice Law] that it requires prioritizing the health, safety, and environmental needs of the individuals in [overburdened communities] and that neither DEP nor applicants for approvals are allowed to trade fewer pollution reductions for more jobs and tax ratables,” Judge Heidi Currier wrote for the panel.

New Jersey marks all or part of 341 municipalities covering more than 5.2 million residents as overburdened communities, according to data maintained by the Department of Environmental Protection.

Those include portions of cities — swathes of Newark and Atlantic City, for example — but they also include parts of wealthier suburbs like Voorhees, where significant percentages of residents in a given census block are low-income, are non-white, or speak limited English.

The court rejected the plaintiffs’ other challenges for similar reasons. Rules requiring reviews for expansions at existing facilities — including ones that do not alter a facility’s physical footprint — are not overbroad because those expansions could still strain public health, the court said.

Rules requiring additional environmental reviews in census blocks with zero residents bordering overburdened communities are likewise permissible because pollution generated there could flow to areas covered by the law.

Regulations requiring air pollution controls at some sites are also permissible, the judges ruled. Scrap recyclers and the union had charged that those provisions conflict with the Air Pollution Control Act and are impermissibly vague.

The court also rejected plaintiffs’ claims that the department violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to provide meaningful analysis of the rules’ impact on jobs and the economy, arguing its impact reports were “devoid of meaningful analysis or information.”

The department had released all required economic impact statements alongside the rule proposal, the judges said, adding the law does not require the department to make a more fulsome analysis of how the rule might affect New Jersey’s economy.

“Neither the rule nor the APA require an agency to provide specific cost information or quantify the expected costs and revenues generated or lost. ‘All that is required is for the agency to describe the expected economic impact,’” Currier wrote, citing an earlier case.

Dennis Toft, who represented the engineers union, expressed disappointment in the ruling.

“We’re disappointed that the appellate division deferred completely to DEP when circumstances where it was admitted by the DEP that the legislation had gaps in it that DEP, on its own, decided to fill those gaps without pointing them out and going back and having the robust legislative debate that would’ve been called for,” he said.

He said it is too early to say whether his clients would petition the New Jersey Supreme Court for an appeal.

Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa.
“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said.

The Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force, initiated by Gov. Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa.

Reynolds said in a news release the task force marks a “strategic step forward” to ensuring Iowa has a “safe, efficient, and responsible integration” of nuclear energy.

“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said. “With our strong foundation in manufacturing and energy innovation, we are uniquely positioned to lead the nation in developing and deploying nuclear technologies.”

Presently, Iowa has no operational nuclear energy plants, but NextEra Energy is working to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Linn County. The company’s request to rezone close to 400 acres at the site was approved by Linn County Supervisors Monday, though there are still several regulatory hurdles NextEra must cross to be operational at the start of 2029 as it plans.

The plant, if restarted, would generate 615 megawatts of energy and have more than 400 onsite, full-time jobs. Google signed an agreement with NextEra in October to purchase power from Duane Arnold nuclear site to power Google cloud and artificial intelligence operations.

Lane Witten, a vice president at NextEra, was chosen as one of 14 members to serve on the Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force.

The task force is chaired by Mark Nutt, a graduate of Iowa State University’s Nuclear Engineering program and the director of Nuclear Energy Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Other members represent utilities, local government, industry and the Iowa Utilities Commission.

State legislators Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny; Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines; Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter; Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, and Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, also serve on the task force.

According to the news release, the task force is asked to assess emerging nuclear technologies for Iowa’s energy sector, engage with industry leaders to help develop the necessary workforce for the industry, as well as engage with manufacturers and other stakeholders to identify potential barriers to entry in the nuclear field.

The task force is also asked to explore engagement opportunities with federal nuclear energy programs to “ensure Iowa’s policies and initiatives align with national regulations” and to evaluate opportunities for economic growth within the nuclear energy sector.

While energy consumption remained fairly stable across the U.S. from 2000-2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a recent report from the consulting firm ICF projected overall energy demand will increase by 25% by 2030. The report attributes the growth in part to data centers that power cloud and artificial intelligence models, as well as increased electrification in transportation and building sectors.

Reynolds has identified nuclear energy as one of her priorities to build an “affordable, reliable and sustainable energy system” for the state. The governor’s energy bill from the 2025 legislative session also called for the General Assembly to “encourage the development” of nuclear electric power generation, but the bill did not make it to the floor for debate in either chamber.

Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump. NextEra’s website for the Duane Arnold restart claims the project contributes “toward the Administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.”

According to the news release, the task force has 180 days to submit a final report on its findings and recommendations to the governor, per the executive order.

Additional task force members include:

May Farlinger, president of Alliant Energy’s Iowa company, Interstate Power & Light Company; Mike Fehr, senior vice president of renewable generation and compliance at MidAmerican Energy; Brandy Meisheid, chair of the Linn County Board of Supervisors; Jim McCalley, distinguished professor at Iowa State University; Sarah Martz, chair of the Iowa Utilities Commission; Matt Resor, business manager for IBEW Local 405, and Andy Roberts with Central Iowa Building & Construction Trades Council.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-83/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2177851416-1024x7671767735278.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=m4AiBI21,N,,2026-01-06 20:59:45.685095

Dive Brief:

Battery maker LG Energy Solution has agreed to sell its stake of its electric vehicle joint venture battery plant building in Ohio to Honda Development and Manufacturing of America for $2.85 billion, according to a Dec. 23 regulatory filing.

The plans for the joint venture EV battery plant were announced in August 2022 and included an initial investment commitment of $3.5 billion by Honda and LG Energy Solution to produce lithium-ion batteries for electric Honda and Acura models for the North American market beginning in 2026.

The transaction includes the building and infrastructure assets related to the joint venture, but excludes the land and equipment. The joint venture will continue to use the facility under a lease agreement, with no changes to production or operational plans, according to the Korea Herald. The deal is scheduled to close on Feb. 28.

Dive Insight:

The L-H Battery Co. joint venture between LG Energy Solution and Honda was formally establishedin January 2023 to produce battery cells in the U.S. for future Honda and Acura EVs.

Although the two companies planned an initial investment commitment of $3.5 billion in the Ohio plant, the total investment was expected to reach up to $4.4 billion, with a targeted annual capacity of 40GWh of battery cells.

According to LG Energy Solution’s regulatory filing, the deal to divest its stake in the battery plant building is intended to “increase the operational efficiency” of its joint venture with Honda. However, the plant may expand production of batteries for energy storage system applications, according to the Korea Herald.

In October 2024, LG Energy Solution announced it will focus more on producing energy storage system batteries as part of its mid-to-long-term business strategy, which are in high demand due to the AI data center construction boom in the U.S. But the company said its long-term plans to develop advanced batteries for the auto industry will remain a priority.

Honda announced plans to establish an “EV Hub” in Ohio in March 2023, which included the construction of the joint venture battery plant with LG Energy Solution. But with changing market conditions, Honda and other automakers, including General Motors and Ford Motor Co., have revised their EV timelines and no longer require the battery capacity previously anticipated.

In October, GM announced it was cutting thousands of jobs at its U.S. EV factories and battery plants amid slowing demand. The plans include the laying off 550 workers at its Ultium Cells EV battery joint venture plant in Ohio and pausing production at a second Ultium Cells production site in Tennessee.

Last month, Ford Motor Co. and battery maker SK On reached an agreement to dissolve their EV battery joint venture “BlueOval SK.” The JV was established in September 2021 as part of a planned $11.4 billion investment by the two companies to build three large-scale manufacturing plants in the U.S. to produce batteries for Ford’s future EVs.

Also last month, Ford terminated its multi-billion-dollar supply deal with LG Energy Solution for 75 GWh of battery cells due to weakening EV demand.

Hybrid Momentum and Budget Trucks Drive Growth

Ford reported that its U.S. auto sales increased in 2025, supported by continued interest in hybrid vehicles and an emphasis on more affordable pickup options, even as electric vehicle sales slowed.

The automaker said total annual U.S. sales reached 2,204,124 vehicles in 2025, up from 2,078,832 in the prior year, reflecting a 6% gain.

Hybrid models were a key contributor. Ford described 2025 as its strongest year to date for hybrid sales, with volumes climbing nearly 22% to 228,072 units compared with 187,426 units a year earlier.

Ford also highlighted the performance of its compact Maverick pickup, positioned as an affordable option in the truck segment. Maverick sales rose about 18% to 155,051 units, up from 131,142 units a year ago, as demand for the lower-priced truck remained firm.

“(Maverick sales) really had a big impact on how we addressed affordability in the market,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations, on a Monday evening call.

Shift Toward Lower-Priced Models

According to the company, customers increasingly focused on entry-level versions of its vehicles to navigate elevated price levels across the auto sector. Ford said buyers were gravitating toward more affordable base models as high industry pricing persisted.

Industry Context and Competitive Landscape

Ford’s sales update followed similar reports from other global automakers. The company’s announcement came one day after Toyota, Hyundai and General Motors also reported increases in their annual U.S. sales.

The broader industry faced a challenging backdrop, with the year described as turbulent due to tariffs and the elimination of a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit. Despite those pressures, several major manufacturers, including Ford, still recorded overall sales growth.

EV Retrenchment and Large Writedown

While hybrids and compact pickups supported Ford’s volumes, the company has been reassessing its electric vehicle strategy. In December, the Detroit-based manufacturer disclosed that it would record a $19.5 billion writedown and discontinue several electric vehicle models.

The move was presented as a prominent example of the sector’s pullback from battery-powered vehicles in light of policies under the Donald Trump administration and softening demand for EVs.

Daniel Raimi: Hello, and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future. I’m your host, Daniel Raimi. This week, it’s our special end-of-the-year episode featuring three of my colleagues: Karen Palmer, Kevin Rennert, and Margaret Walls. In today’s episode, we’re going to have a little bit of fun talking about the 10 topics that we thought were the most interesting this year. It’s not exactly a Top 10 list, but it’s something close to it. In any case, you’ll hear that we’re having a lot of fun, and I hope you enjoy this episode, as well. Happy New Year!

Karen Palmer, Kevin Rennert, and Margaret Walls, welcome back to our special, extra-fun, end-of-the-year episode here on Resources Radio. It’s great to have you all.

Kevin Rennert: It’s great to be here.

Karen Palmer: Thanks.

Margaret Walls: Thanks, Daniel. Good to be here.

Daniel Raimi: We’re going to be a little silly this year, and we’re going to do something like a Top 10 list, where we each identify a few things in the news or in the world of policy that we think were really important that we want to talk about this year. We’re going to get started with Karen, and we’re going to talk about:

Everyone: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act!

Daniel Raimi: Karen, take it away.

Karen Palmer: Thanks, Daniel. Well, to tell the story, I want to start back in 2022, which is when the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). And the thing that I want to focus on from that act is that it used tax credits, which had existed off and on and were existing for renewables, but they got extended by quite a bit and expanded by quite a bit. Basically, the idea is to use these tax credits to accelerate decarbonization of the electricity sector.

Another thing that happened in that act is, beginning in 2024, it wasn’t just about renewables. It was a technology-neutral approach to expanding clean energy. And the point back then was to keep these tax credits in place until we’d reached a level of national emissions that were 25 percent below 2022 levels. So, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (or OBBBA) passed in July of this year, and that limited the application of tax credits for clean electricity in a number of ways, including moving up the start date for construction of projects to be eligible for either the production tax credit or the investment tax credit to mid-2026. And most projects had to be online by the end of 2027 to be eligible for these credits, which is substantially earlier than was the case under the IRA.

There are also limits put in place—stricter limits on foreign ownership of materials or components from certain countries that were identified, which could mess with supply chains and make it complicated to meet those new accelerated deadlines.

It’s important to point out that the OBBBA does allow for other technologies to continue to receive tax credits—like batteries, geothermal, and advanced nuclear—so those stick around for a longer period of time. What does this mean? Well, when the bill was being debated, we did some modeling here at RFF that focused on wholesale repeal of these tax credits. It’s a little bit more draconian than what actually ended up happening, but we found that it would reduce wind- and solar-capacity investment by hundreds of gigawatts by 2035 and raise average electricity bills between $75 and $100 per year in 2030. So, that’s substantial. And also increase power-sector emissions by 350 million to 400 million metric tons in 2035, so roughly 25 percent. So, it’s a big impact.

Daniel Raimi: Kevin, you are going to talk about:

Everyone: Federal renewables permitting!

Kevin Rennert: That’s right. So, Karen just talked about how the sort of federal support from the tax credits actually was reduced in this Congress, but there’s been sort of a whole-of-government approach to slowing down the deployment of renewables, and a lot of that has been coming from the Trump administration in terms of what it’s been doing on permitting of renewables projects.

Some of this has been at the project level, where if we look all the way back to April, there was a stop-work order on the 810-megawatt Empire Wind project, the offshore wind project which had previously been permitted and had already begun construction. I should say that action did later resume, after there was sort of a behind-closed-doors negotiation where suddenly the governor of New York started speaking positively about natural gas pipelines being resumed.

Another project in August that actually got stopped was Revolution Winds. It’s a $6.2-billion project off the coast of Rhode Island, which was actually 80 percent constructed and also had a stop-work order placed upon it. And that, later, was overturned by a federal judge, as well.

And even more recently, in October, the Bureau of Land Management canceled the Esmerelda 7 Solar Project in its environmental-permitting process and just sort of shut it down and said, “This is a group of seven projects that’s been moving together,” which is a novel new way of doing this, that is intended to speed up the process. And it said, “We’re stopping that process, but each of the seven projects can come back and start the process over again individually.”

So, that’s just some individual examples of the way that the Trump administration has been using the heft of the federal government, through the permitting process, to slow things down.

And these all kind of tracked with some of the memorandums that were coming out throughout the year. Secretary Burgum actually had a memo come out for [the Department of the] Interior, saying that all kinds of renewables projects (solar, wind, etc.) needed to be passed through his office directly for sign-off, which is clearly going to be slowing things down. There was a further memo saying that we should focus on capacity density for these renewables projects and for projects in general. So, fossil projects are expected to have a much higher capacity density in terms of megawatts per acre that are impacted. And that flowed down to the agriculture departments, to the Army Corps of Engineers in terms of prioritizing projects, and the permitting process, and so on. So there’s been really a very comprehensive use of the permitting process to work against the deployment of renewables.

And you would think that that would affect just projects on federal lands. But what’s been, I think, interesting to observe over the course of this year is the number of private projects that actually have some sort of interaction with the federal government, where, even though it’s a small component of what that private-land project needs, the fact that it has to go through the federal government, and the federal government is not playing ball with it, has really put a chill on investment in general.

Daniel Raimi: Kevin, can you give an example of what is the nexus between the small solar or wind project and the federal point of intervention?

Kevin Rennert: Sure, could be a lot. It could be that that particular project needs to have transmission that’s going to tie it into the transmission system that goes on federal land, or maybe it needs a Clean Water Act permit or something along those lines.

I think as we thought about it, we assumed it would be relatively limited, but it turns out that if you talk to developers, there are countless actions that actually require this. There was an American Clean Power Association study that came out that said that there were 69 permitting actions that were listed in the memo, that 29 of them actually apply to things that are on private lands. So it’s a pretty substantial nexus.

Daniel Raimi: Let’s go next to Margaret who is going to talk about:

Everyone: FEMA!

Margaret Walls: All right. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for all of you who don’t know. But FEMA’s been in turmoil this year, so we need to talk about that a little bit.

It began with the president saying, “We just need to abolish FEMA or eliminate FEMA.” Interestingly, earlier this month there was a Grist article that had the headline, “FEMA’s Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Year.” And I think that pretty much says it. There has been a lot of back and forth on this idea of abolishing FEMA.

Just so everybody knows, FEMA handles all of the disaster-relief activities. The states also participate, but FEMA funnels a lot of federal dollars after a disaster for recovery. FEMA also offers grants for recovery. They operate very important grant programs that Congress appropriates money for, and also for recovery, and also for building resilience to events that are going to occur in the future. And then they operate some other kinds of resilience grant programs, which have all been axed. And then finally, they do other things, as well, but they run the National Flood Insurance Program, which is really the only place most people get their flood insurance, through the NFIP—the federal government.

There was, I think, three (or we’re on number four) acting administrators of FEMA. One person was put in place, and then he testified on the Hill and said, “Oh, we’re not going to abolish FEMA. We’re just going to reorganize.” And he was axed right after that. And then another person was put in place who was very controversial, who when the Texas floods happened (which we’re going to talk about in a minute), he was off the grid and couldn’t be reached. And he just quit in November. And so now, in December (we’re recording this in December), they have yet another one; I don’t even know who it is.

They’ve lost 10 to 20 percent of their workforce through various attritions—either firings, or voluntary separations, or other things.

And then finally, I want to mention that, as it turns out, today (we’re recording on December 11) is the day that the FEMA Review Council, which was put together by Trump through executive order earlier this year, was supposed to release their final report. And there have been some news stories. People have had access to this 80-page report and reported on what the recommendations are. But even as we speak—five minutes before we’re recording—the Washington Post is reporting that the White House has said they need to go back to the drawing board and rethink it because it’s not specific enough.

But a couple of things that are in it that have been reported is that FEMA is going to … Many people have called for it to be an independent agency, but their recommendation is that it stay in the Department of Homeland Security, its current home. They’ve recommended cutting the workforce in half and moving it out of Washington, giving it a new name. And also that the federal disaster assistance should be reserved for only very large catastrophic events, and that states need to handle the smaller events. I don’t think there’s details on what counts as “large” and “small.” They want the federal disaster-relief money to be issued as block grants, so then states would get the money and do with it as they wish. (Side note on that: They already have the option of doing that, and they don’t like it—states don’t want to take those block grants.) And then they want to encourage private-market provision of flood insurance. And I don’t know what they mean by “encourage.” Maybe that’s what we’re going to see when they go back to the drawing board.

But poor FEMA has been in a state of disarray. We got lucky this year that we did not have a lot of disasters. So, that’s one thing.

Daniel Raimi: All right. We’re going to come back to that topic of disasters in a few minutes with you, Margaret.

Karen, you’re up next, with:

Everyone: Load growth!

Karen Palmer: As Margaret mentioned, we’re recording this in December, and last night, I went to a holiday party—one of those Washington insider energy and environment … Well, I don’t know about “insider,” but there were a lot of people there talking about various policy things and from the energy space. And you couldn’t walk two feet from the bar without hearing somebody talk about load growth and data centers. So, I’m going to talk about load growth and data centers.

According to tracking by Grid Strategies, which is a small consulting firm that does work on grid-related issues, forecasts for summer peak load growth that system operators turn over to the FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] each year have grown essentially sixfold. Between 2022—when they suggested over five years, load was going to grow 22 gigawatts—and in 2024, it’s 120 gigawatts. So, it’s grown quite a bit. And the contributors to this “growth in load growth” forecast—they vary by region across the country, but data centers are expected to contribute substantially to load growth in much of the country, including regions where there hasn’t been much addition of data centers previously.

Some estimates see data centers contributing roughly two thirds of the anticipated load increases in the coming years, which could bring data centers close to 10 percent of total electricity demand by 2029. But these forecasts of large loads are really uncertain, and they’re very hard to pin down for a number of reasons, particularly on the AI side of things.

There’s a lot of intense competition among companies to win the AI race. And that need for speed that they have means that they want to move toward the best AI offerings that they can. Meeting this demand for AI requires building massive amounts of new electricity generation. And utility planners and regulators are trying to find a way to get a better handle on that growth. A couple of ways that are being considered are creating special interconnection queues, so basically queues and processes by which large loads are going to enter the grid. Or requiring some sort of financial commitment: so, before we take your expression of need for new energy demand seriously, you have to put some money down to help cover some of the costs that are going to be associated with meeting that demand.

Now, the Trump administration is making several efforts to facilitate load growth by AI facilities, including streamlining permitting, identifying data-center sites on federal lands, and directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue a rule on interconnecting large loads. With respect to that last item, in October, the Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, sent a draft advance notice of proposed rulemaking (also known as an ANOPR, to add to your list of acronyms here) on the interconnection of large loads to the FERC commissioner. So he sent this ANOPR to the FERC commissioners, inviting FERC to assert its authority to oversee interconnecting of these large loads—not just data centers, but it could be a large load from a manufacturing facility, for example.

And the reasoning is that they require a lot of electricity. They hook up to the transmission grid. FERC has jurisdiction over the transmission grid. However, historically, interconnection of loads has been the purview of state regulators. So, this is really jostling a lot of tradition and getting a lot of attention from people. And this new direction, it’s seen as important to the Trump administration’s strategy of promoting leadership in both AI and domestic manufacturing, but there’s going to be a lot of discussions out there. And some governors, including the governor of Florida, are resisting this type of addition of new loads. So, we’ll see what happens.

Daniel Raimi: Yes. I was reading about that, as some senators, as well, have been vocal in opposition. And we’re going to come back to what all of this means for electricity affordability in a few minutes.

Let’s go to Kevin, who’s going to talk about:

Everyone: The endangerment finding!

Kevin Rennert: That’s right. So, I think that many people that have paid attention to the climate policy conversation in DC at times may have forgotten that there was a time when EPA [the US Environmental Protection Agency] did not have the requirement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. And it turns out that that stems from a particular finding called the endangerment finding that the Obama administration made, many years ago at this point. And so from that fundamental finding flows the obligation of the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.

So, at the beginning of the Trump administration, there was a lot of discussion about whether or not the administration would simply look to rescind the regulations of greenhouse gas emissions and modify them in some way, or whether it would actually go after this fundamental finding that would then obviate all of those different regulations. And in general, what’s happening is it’s actually doing both.

And so the endangerment finding that is being reconsidered by EPA, EPA has proposed to interpret its own authority really narrowly under the Clean Air Act, which means that if it interprets it this narrowly, it would no longer have the requirement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

So, the two different rationales that were put forward by EPA: One of them is very, very legalistic in nature, and it’s really about EPA’s overall authority to make the endangerment finding—the tie between vehicles and the harms from climate change and whether or not such regulations would actually even have an effect on the problem.

But then there’s this second piece, which is where I think many experts expected the administration to go, which is just talking about the interpretation of climate science. And this is relying on a recent DOE report that was done by five scientists, and really runs counter to the overwhelming consensus of the broader scientific community on the climate change impact, to say those effects have been overstated.

And just as a catchall, there was also a proposal to just rescind all the regulations of greenhouse gas emissions emitted by US vehicles, even if that finding were to be upheld. So, this is fundamentally important in that, if the administration is successful in winding back the endangerment finding, obviously EPA will no longer have the requirement to regulate these emissions. And this thing, that has been often held up as the foil to what Congress would or would not do, goes away. There’s also a conversation that if the Congress were not to act on climate change, EPA would step in and use its authority. Here, we’re seeing that that very much may not be the case. So, a lot to watch.

Daniel Raimi: And we’ll be watching it in the courts over the next months and years?

Kevin Rennert: We’ll see that there will be a finalization. So, public comments were finalized on September 15, and so then there needs to be a final action, and then we will see that play out in the courts. That’s exactly right.

Daniel Raimi: All right, we’re going to go back to Margaret with a really serious topic. We are trying to have a little bit of fun on today’s show, but this is a real serious one. But we’ll still give it our same energetic introduction, which is that Margaret will be talking about:

Everyone: Fires and floods!

Margaret Walls: Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, as I said earlier, we had a comparatively quiet hurricane season (and wildfire season, actually), and that was lucky, given the turmoil at FEMA, but we did have a couple of big events.

So, let’s take everybody back almost a year, to January, when we had the wildfires in Los Angeles. That was really hugely devastating. That’s the worst fires we’ve had in US history, and those were the Palisades and Eaton Fires that destroyed about 16,000 structures, with 31 deaths. The big thing there is the fires went through developed areas, so they were very damaging.

And then the second thing was the Texas floods. I want to remind people that in July, the Guadalupe River overran its banks. There was a huge precipitation event and terrible floods. What made them particularly horrifying and disturbing was that many children were killed because the flooding went through some summer camps. This was in the Texas Hill Country—so, in the middle of Texas.

Obviously, these are two quite different events, but I want to bring some threads together about them, and that’s under the climate change umbrella. There are many factors that create a flood or wildfire, and it’s not all about climate change. There’s a lot of things that go into it, and we often talk about them. We talk about wildfires; we talk about how we’ve managed our forests in a certain way to have fuels build up, and that’s created a problem, and so forth.

But in the case of both of these events, I think, and the attribution (there’s a whole attribution science for climate change, and those haven’t been done, to my knowledge, exactly), both of these events have really strong markers for climate change.

In the case of the fires, conditions were very arid. They had been in a drought for many, many months in the region, and at the same time, there were huge windstorms that built up. These fires occurred in January, which is not what people would consider fire season, at all. In the case of the Palisades Fire, those lands that burned are chaparral shrublands, so they’re not pine forests, but it was massively dry, with huge Santa Ana winds blowing through that created these conditions that caused these fires. There really isn’t very much that can be done about this, except to make the conditions better in the first place.

In the case of the floods, we had something we’re increasingly seeing, which is massive amounts of precipitation over a short period of time. I looked this up recently, and I think that river rose—there was six and a half inches of rain in a three-hour period. That river rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. Now, part of that is the topography of the lands there; the river has a sort of rock bottom.

But these huge precipitation events that are occurring are occurring more often. This was a big problem with Hurricane Helene and why we had the flooding in Appalachia that we had. They had massive amounts of rain. The floods in Appalachia and Kentucky in 2022 was a huge rain event, and there’s more and more evidence suggesting that these rain events are due to climate change. In the Texas case, the Gulf was very warm, and that warm air sort of sat over the state and created the conditions, as I understand it, for this massive rain event. So, I just bring this up because these are what we face, and they’re really, really challenging problems to solve and to adapt, to figure out how to adapt.

Obviously, people don’t want those summer camps on that river, but they’re on the river because the river’s really nice, and they want to be there for that. And they had very little warning to get those kids and other people out of there. It wasn’t just the camps. So those two events were really big in the news for me this year.

Daniel Raimi: They were. Thank you, Margaret.

All right. Let’s go back to Karen on the electricity beat for one last item. Karen, you are next going to talk about:

Everyone: Affordability!

Karen Palmer: Thanks, Daniel. Affordability of electricity is something that a week doesn’t go by when there’s not a headline in a major news outlet. And I guess it was particularly prominent during the election campaigns for a couple of states; in the so-called off-year governor’s elections in both Virginia and New Jersey, there was a lot of discussion about electricity affordability. And both of the winning candidates made promises to do something about dealing with the high prices of electricity. But it’s attracted the attention of sitting governors in other states, as well, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and California—all places where the governors have called out their dissatisfaction with the high prices that folks are paying for electricity there.

When you look particularly at certain households, electricity costs are imposing a big burden. The latest estimate from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association report is that 17 million US households are behind on their energy bills, and a recent Census survey finds that 34 percent of households cut back on basic household necessities, such as medicine or food, to pay an energy bill.

So what, specifically, has been going on with electricity prices? Well, looking at data from 2024 and going back, what you see depends on your starting year, but starting from 2019, electricity prices on average across the nation have risen 27 percent. If you start in 2021, the increase has only been 21 percent. And then when you adjust for inflation (here, we’re using the consumer price index), the price increases over those two time periods have been roughly 4.5 percent and 4.9 percent. And this is particularly striking, because it comes after about 15 years where average electricity prices actually rose less than the rate of inflation. So, it’s a definite change from the recent past, but it’s also important to point out that, while average prices across the country are rising, there’s differential things going on in different regions.

And so I’m going to take some statistics here from my colleagues Jesse Buchsbaum and Jenya Kahn-Lang in their recent Resources magazine article, where they have some cool maps and graphs about this phenomenon. What they show is that only a few regions have really experienced price increases beyond inflation that were over 10 percent. And the largest ones between 2021 and 2024 occurred in Maine and California, where real prices rose over 20 percent during that three-year time period. There were also large price increases, slightly smaller than that, in other states in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. However, other parts of the country, including many states in the central part of the country and the Southeast and the Mountain States had flat or decreasing electricity prices during these recent years.

So, why are we seeing these prices rise? Well, there’s a combination of factors here, but two important ones that I want to stress is, with respect to producing the electricity: increases in gas prices that happened after the start of the Ukraine War contributed to the higher costs of energy—the energy component of electricity bills in certain places.

But there’s also been longer-term trends associated with increases in the costs of the transmission and distribution grid. Some of this is related to just maintaining the grids, which are getting old. But specifically with California, for example, taking actions to mitigate wildfire risk posed by the transmission lines is one factor. And in Maine, there just were some really bad storms that knocked out a lot of lines. And so there was a lot of repair work that had to go on, and making things more resilient.

So, we definitely have a lot to learn here about what the causes are, because understanding those causes are going to be important to addressing them. And a little picture: we do have a strategic initiative here at RFF that’s exploring these causes.

In terms of what are policymakers doing now to respond: Well, there’s many different things going on, but I think there is increasingly a cautious eye toward policies that might increase these costs. Some states are scaling back on their energy-efficiency policies, and maybe even the pace with which they’re going to approach their clean energy goals. There’s a debate on whether or not that is price-decreasing or not. I think an important issue here is that some investments are going to be necessary in the short run to reduce costs in the long run, and particularly exposure to things like fossil fuel prices, for example.

So, there’s a lot to learn and a lot to tussle with here in terms of addressing these, I’d say.

Daniel Raimi: I know one of the big things people are thinking about with electricity prices is your previous topic, which is load growth, and data centers in particular. Going forward, are we going to be talking a lot about data centers and electricity prices, or do you think that topic’s going to fade, or is it too soon to know?

Karen Palmer: I don’t think it’s going to fade anytime soon. And I do think there are some things that are happening in some states to address this, and really try to protect existing customers and customers that aren’t the data center. So, really figure out a way to use creative approaches to rate design to get the cost-causality part right in that exercise.

Daniel Raimi: I think this will be a good topic for us to revisit regularly throughout the year, actually, as things develop. All right. Next, we’re going to go to Kevin. And actually, Karen sets you up very nicely, because Karen was just talking about:

Everyone: California!

Kevin Rennert: Such a good setup. So, if I look back in time to the last time we had a big transition in government, going from the Obama administration to the Trump administration, one of the big storylines was that, as the federal government sort of stepped back from addressing climate change, a lot of the states really stepped up in a big way to address climate change. And so, one question this time around has been, Are we going to see the same thing? And that’s one of the things that I’ve been paying attention to this year.

One of the big stories on that, really, from this year, is what California did, where it put through a package of more than six different proposals that would reaffirm its commitment to its cap-and-trade program and also made some really important changes that put it forward in the frame of affordability. So, I’m just going to talk through a few of these, and I’m definitely channeling our colleague Dallas Burtraw, who has done a lot of writing about this.

One big thing that California did was, with a bipartisan and supermajority vote, it extended the carbon market from 2030 all the way out to 2045. It was not ready to expire, but it actually was under a fair bit of pressure from a lot of places. And so California took the prescient step to step forward and move it all the way to 2045, before it needed to.

On the affordability front, it’s important to know that in California, a big chunk of electricity rates actually comes from utilities having to guard against wildfire and insure against wildfire, and make transmission upgrades that all go into the rate base. And so, one of the things that happened in this package of bills is that a portion of the carbon allowance value that’s given to utility customers was actually directed to transmission upgrades—so, it came out of the rate base and actually went in this fashion. And also the state stepped up and now assumes a portion of wildfire liability, which again reduces the amounts that utilities have to insure against, as well.

Some other interesting things that happened in that, it altered the vision for offsets, where just as before, an entity can use offsets for up to 6 percent of what they’re doing. And that’s important, because it actually preserves the incentive for people to look for the least-cost opportunities. But now those offsets actually come out from under the cap in future years. And so, it’s a nice hedge against those offsets not being fully fungible with existing mitigation reductions. And that also aligns it with what’s happening in Washington and New York.

And finally, it’s reversed an earlier decision that said that there are free allocations of these permits to energy-intensive trade-exposed businesses, which was done without regard for what their actual trade exposure was.

And now this says that CARB [the California Air Resources Board] can once again revisit that and make determinations on how many allowances these companies actually need to make them still competitive with out-of-state competitors. So, the money that gets potentially clawed back from that can then be used for other things, like helping people pay their bills and things like that.

There are a number of other things that happened within this package, including that now utilities have the ability to reach out to voluntary regional markets to expand your potential sources of electricity to be selling to your customers. And all of this is really geared at reducing the cost of this and preserving its capacity moving forward. So, a big deal.

Daniel Raimi: A big deal. And we’ll refer people also to our recent podcast episode with Kate Gordon, where we talked a lot about California policy developments over the past year.

Kevin Rennert: The fabulous Kate Gordon.

Daniel Raimi: Let’s go to Margaret last, with our ninth topic of the day. And that topic is:

Everyone: Public land sales!

Margaret Walls: Thank you, Daniel. I’m going to pivot on this one. In the budget reconciliation bill, when it first came out of Congress back in the spring, there was a provision to sell off some of our federal lands.

The federal government, so that people know, owns 640 million acres of land. That’s about 28 percent of the US land area, so it’s a lot of land. The biggest landholder is the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), followed by the Forest Service. And then of course we have the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and so forth.

So, the proposal was: We’re going to sell some of those lands. And it was a little vague, but the argument put forward is that this is going to help with housing affordability, another affordability crisis in the country that people talk a lot about. And some of these towns in the West, near where a lot of these lands are, are seeing some very steep housing price increases in recent years.

But it was also, I felt like, a little bit of a bait and switch on that. I’m not sure it was really all about housing affordability, because some of the proponents of selling federal lands have been proposing that for many, many years, or proposing transferring lands to the states. So, this has been on the agenda for some representatives from Utah for a long time. What’s interesting about this is that ultimately the bill—the OBBBA, or whatever the acronym is—eventually, the bill did not include the land sales. And what was interesting, why it didn’t go through, was suddenly, there was a huge amount of bipartisan opposition. And RFF did some work on this. I like to think we had played some role. We did a briefing on the Hill. We did some analysis of the whole notion of land sales helping with housing affordability.

We compared, in 20 cities in the West, how much of this land is there in buffers around these cities, and how much is there relative to other undeveloped lands—privately owned, developable lands. And there’s a lot more of the latter in many of the most expensive places than there is of BLM land. Anyway, I think our analysis was pretty helpful, but also what really happened is the hunters and fishermen came out. Some of our senators and representatives in states like Montana were very opposed because their constituents were opposed. And so, in the end, there were various versions of these provisions that included, in some iterations, Forest Service and BLM land. So, there were various things on the table, and ultimately it was all taken away. But I bring it up, because the issue has not died. There was a prior bill introduced to do this.

There was a commission that was put together between the Department of Interior and HUD (the [US Department of] Housing and Urban Development) to look at this issue a little bit more. There’s still, as I understand it—the Western Governors’ Association has some interest in this. So, the issue’s not going away. I think it’ll come back up in another form. And at the same time, this sort of conservation and recreation values of our public lands are really bipartisan and growing, I think. So I find this really fascinating, how we look at this issue.

The last little plug I’ll put in is that there’s a lot of other things going on with public lands. So I’m limiting this to the land sales thing, but a lot of other stuff has happened with public lands. And we covered some of it in a webinar; the recording is on our website. We had a nice webinar in July, which included my colleagues Dave Ware and Brian Prest and myself. And we talked about some of the oil and gas leasing issues, forest timber sales, and various things like that. So I would encourage our listeners to go watch that.

Daniel Raimi: Excellent. And we’ll have a link to that in the show notes, as well.

Margaret Walls: Daniel, we’re only at nine, and we need a Top 10. Hey, you’ve got to have one of these! So, we want you to give us your topic, which is:

Everyone: Hydrocarbon diplomacy!

Daniel Raimi: Well, I thought we were talking mostly about domestic issues with our other nine topics, so I wanted to throw something international out there. And I just thought this was a fascinating development over the course of the past year. The Trump administration has been trying to achieve this goal of energy dominance through a variety of strategies. And one of the big ways that they’ve tried to do this is by increasing US fossil fuel exports, particularly oil and gas exports, which have been rising dramatically over the last 5 to 10 years. But the administration is trying to boost that even further.

And this is related to its efforts on tariffs, where the administration is using tariffs to try to achieve various diplomatic and economic objectives that they have for the United States. Interestingly, some of the US’s trading partners have combined those two issues—the desire for energy dominance and the desire to have some better treatment on tariffs. And to have a better bargaining chip at the table, what many of them have done, or at least some of them have started to do, is to support the purchasing of US oil and natural gas.

The specific examples that come to mind are the European Union, which agreed several months ago to buy $250 billion worth of US energy each year, primarily oil and natural gas. It’s not actually clear whether that’s achievable, but they have said that they will do that. Our colleagues Zach Whitlock and Milan Elkerbout recently wrote about this on the RFF blog.

But also, South Korea and Japan have vocally supported a big project in Alaska that has been on the drawing table for decades, which is to build a natural gas pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska, where most oil is produced in the state, down to the southern part of the state and export it as liquefied natural gas to East Asia, particularly Japan and South Korea. So, these countries have come out with public statements that they’re willing to invest tens of billions of dollars in this Alaska liquefied natural gas project. And I think that’s partly because they’re interested in the energy security, but I think it’s also partly because they’re trying to get on the good side of the administration and have a better position when it comes to negotiating tariffs.

So, I’ve been fascinated to watch those developments, and we’ll see how they evolve over the next year, two years, and three years.

This is usually the time when we do our Top of the Stack segment, but we are a little over time, and not all of us actually have prepared a Top of the Stack. So, me and Kevin are just going to do some quick ones.

I want to recommend the TV show Landman. I think I may have actually mentioned this last year, because the show was about to come out, but season 1 is out, and now season 2 is starting to roll out. I binged all of season 1; I’m looking forward to binging all of season 2. The show is completely ridiculous. It is not at all a realistic representation of what it’s like in the Permian Basin, but it’s a lot of fun.

Margaret Walls: I’ll second that.

Karen Palmer: Yeah, me too.

Kevin Rennert: Yeah!

Margaret Walls: It’s a soap opera.

Daniel Raimi: If you want to have good information about life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, Landman is not the resource for you. You should consult the academic literature on that, but it’s a really fun show.

Kevin, what are you thinking about?

Kevin Rennert: This has nothing to do with energy, but a friend of mine recently gave me a book to read with my kids by Salman Rushdie, who you do not think of as a children’s novelist, but he did write one, and it’s called Haroun and the Sea of Stories, and it is absolutely delightful.

Daniel Raimi: Amazing. Margaret’s got a last-minute entry here.

Margaret Walls: I do, because I’m reading it right now: The Art Thief. I’m almost done with it. Anybody read that book? In light of the Louvre, the art theft that we had a few months ago, this is one about an amazing crazy guy that did a lot of art theft—the biggest art thief in history—and kept it all for himself. So anyway, I’ll mention that. It’s a good book.

Kevin Rennert: Amazing.

Margaret Walls: Short book, easy to read.

Daniel Raimi: Well, thank you, Margaret. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Karen. This has been a blast. Hope our listeners have enjoyed it, and happy new year, everybody.

The goal of the fund is to enable researchers to make leaps rather than incremental advances in the natural sciences and engineering. It supports projects that lead to the invention of a disruptive new technology that can have a major impact on a field of research, or to the development of equipment or an enabling technology that will transform research in a field.

The fund was created in 2009 through a gift from Eric and Wendy Schmidt. Eric Schmidt is Executive Chairman and CEO of Relativity Space, co-founder of Schmidt Sciences, The Schmidt Family Foundation, and Schmidt Ocean Institute, the former Chief Executive Officer of Google, and former Executive Chairman of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company. Wendy Schmidt is co-founder of Schmidt Sciences, and president and co-founder of The Schmidt Family Foundation and Schmidt Ocean Institute. Eric Schmidt earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Princeton in 1976 and served as a Princeton Trustee from 2004 to 2008.

“Across engineering, computer science, chemistry and geosciences, the research teams supported by the Schmidt fund are developing novel solutions to persistent, thorny problems,” said Princeton University Dean for Research Peter Schiffer, vice president for the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Class of 1909 Professor of Physics. “Their work holds great promise to spark transformative change that will make a meaningful difference in people’s lives and for our collective future.”

The winning proposals were selected by an anonymous panel of faculty reviewers.

The four winning technologies are highlighted below.

New AI system to transform how scientists identify small molecules

Ellen D. Zhong, assistant professor of computer science

Mohammad R. Seyedsayamdost, professor of chemistry

Determining the 3-D structure of small molecules, a class that includes hormones, vitamins, and most FDA-approved drugs, is essential for understanding how they function and interact in cells. However, current techniques require painstaking and time-consuming experimentation. In this project, the researchers seek to develop an algorithm that can automate the process of determining small molecule structure from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analysis.

In preliminary work, the researchers developed a machine learning algorithm that reliably translated one-dimensional NMR spectra of five-residue peptides into precise molecular structures. The current project will expand this approach to include broad classes of small molecules of various sizes and structure types. The project has three aims: to compile a database of NMR spectra for large-scale deep learning, to develop an algorithm that incorporates context-dependent considerations, and to apply the algorithm to the discovery of novel small molecules.

The researchers anticipate that the open-source release of this algorithm will significantly benefit scientists in many disciplines and transform drug discovery.

Soft, flexible materials for next-generation batteries and electronics

Rodney Priestley, dean of the Graduate School and the Pomeroy and Betty Perry Smith Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering

Craig Arnold, Susan Dod Brown Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and vice dean for innovation in the Office of the Dean for Research

In this project, the researchers aim to advance sustainable battery design through the development of improved hydrogel electrolytes. Hydrogels offer advantages over conventional battery electrolytes, but they bring challenges as well, including structural weakness, instability at low temperatures, and incompatibility with nonaqueous battery systems.

This project builds on the researchers’ previous work on hydrogels, in which they developed a dehydration-rehydration method that successfully improved the materials’ strength and recyclability but did not address thermal stability. The current project will evaluate hydrogels produced through a promising new method that replaces water with a green Deep Eutectic Solvent consisting of choline chloride and glycerol. Researchers will assess the viability and commercial potential of the improved hydrogels by testing their performance in zinc- and lithium-based prototype batteries.

The team’s proposed hydrogel-based energy storage system represents a breakthrough in sustainable battery technology, with potential applications in the renewable energy, transportation and soft robotics industries.

Speeding up natural hydrogen generation for clean energy

Andlinger Professor in Energy and the Environment and a Professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, and applied and computational mathematics

Natural hydrogen (H2) gas, which can be harvested without an electric power source, presents a promising renewable alternative to fossil fuels. The researchers aim to study mineral­-driven H2 generation and to test strategies to accelerate this process. They propose research in three areas, with the first focused on identifying reaction conditions and cascading pathways to achieve near 100% iron oxidation, which would lead to an order of magnitude increase in H2 generation. The second project area will examine molecular-level processes that control macro­scale kinetic and thermodynamic properties of H2-generating mineral reactions. Third, the researchers will investigate the conditions necessary for H2 generation with simultaneous carbon dioxide mineralization. Discovering how to couple and control these processes could make natural H2 production carbon-negative rather than simply carbon-neutral.

Overall, this project has enormous potential for generating knowledge to help scale the production of sustainable H2 gas — a key step toward decarbonizing the nation’s energy system.

Underwater robots to map threats to coral reefs and marine life

Curtis Deutsch, professor of geosciences and the High Meadows Environmental Institute

Noelle Lucey, former associate research scholar, High Meadows Environmental Institute

To address the lack of observational data on coral reefs, the research team will design, build and test a low-cost autonomous vehicle system to measure hydrographic data in challenging coastal environments. SeaWASP (Winched Autonomous Sensor Profiler) is capable of traveling to and remaining at precise locations, navigating uneven terrain and storm conditions, and recording measurements at multiple depths.

Following its test deployment on a coral reef off the coast of Puerto Rico, SeaWASP’s data will be used to train machine learning algorithms to relate local variability measurements to broader ocean and meteorological conditions and to map the effects of key stressors. Finally, the team will use observational data to build a trait-based habitat model that can provide real-time assessments of reef health and forecasts of near- and long-term threats, in the hope of facilitating adaptive practices and policies to mitigate these threats.

By bringing together innovative design engineering, cost efficiency, and advanced machine learning techniques, this project promises to revolutionize data collection and analysis in coastal reef environments and greatly enhance reef conservation, management and policy efforts around the world.",https://engineering.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20241030_FrickDrone_RH_011_4000x2250-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 19:00:09.232031

These new advanced workforce training facilities will foster development in priority industries, such as advanced manufacturing, and clean energy production and manufacturing.
Two additional awards were also made to Richland Community College and Kankakee Community College to offer training programs in clean energy manufacturing.
“Manufacturing Training Academy grant funding supercharged the Heartland Community College effort to develop our leading-edge EV Technology program.
“Illinois community colleges are uniquely positioned to help power the state’s manufacturing future,” said Brian Durham, Executive Director of the Illinois Community College Board.","Governor JB Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) announced $24 million is now available in grant funding to establish six new Manufacturing Training Academies (MTAs) at community colleges in the state’s downstate regions to expand training for high-demand manufacturing jobs in Illinois. Grantees will be selected through a competitive Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) process.

“Our skilled workforce is part of what makes Illinois a manufacturing powerhouse, and this critical grant funding will empower more Illinoisans to pursue high-demand, well-paying jobs in our growing manufacturing sector,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “My administration is committed to investing in Illinois’ workforce and expanding job training opportunities across the state. I encourage all eligible community colleges to apply and help support the future of our manufacturing economy.”

As part of the State of Illinois’ mission to offer customized programs to make it easier and more affordable for Illinoisans to train for careers in high-growth industries as outlined in Illinois’ Economic Growth Plan, the State is deploying capital grants to strategically support the creation of additional MTAs and provide facility upgrades and equipment needed to train the next generation of manufacturing workers. These new advanced workforce training facilities will foster development in priority industries, such as advanced manufacturing, and clean energy production and manufacturing.

“Every community in Illinois deserves access to affordable education and job training.” said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton. “These investments ensure people can build their lives here at home. As we continue to grow as a hub for manufacturing and innovation, we’re making sure our workforce grows with us—so Illinoisans can train for good-paying careers, support their families, and thrive, without ever having to leave the communities they love.”

Governor Pritzker has committed to growing Illinois’ world-class manufacturing industry, which continues to thrive because of strong state leadership and a commitment to fostering innovation, sustainability, and long-term economic competitiveness. This announcement builds upon recent success in the manufacturing industry as a growing list of manufacturers have chosen to expand or establish their business in Illinois, including Rockford Brake Manufacturing, Cache Energy, NANO Nuclear, and more.

“Since the program’s inception, Manufacturing Training Academies have been an important link between growing manufacturers and the skilled workforce they need, creating stronger ties between industry and community colleges to build new opportunities for people in those regions,” said DCEO Director Kristin Richards. “Guided by the principles in Illinois’ Economic Growth Plan, expanding the MTA program is a critical step to prepare Illinoisans for a successful future in priority industries.”

The MTA program was first envisioned in Illinois’ 2019 Economic Growth Plan, which led to DCEO providing two competitive awards to construct and equip MTA facilities in north central and southwestern Illinois. In February 2024, Heartland Community College in Normal, Illinois, opened a first-of-its-kind Electric Vehicle Energy Storage Manufacturing Training Academy in partnership with automotive manufacturer Rivian, with programs focused on robotics, HVAC, welding, digital media and electric vehicles. Five months later, grant funding enabled Southwestern Illinois College in Belleville, Illinois, to open doors to a 33,000-square-foot manufacturing education hub, which included expanding its offerings by launching additive manufacturing, tool and die mold-making and advanced automation/multi-axis computer numerical control certificates. Two additional awards were also made to Richland Community College and Kankakee Community College to offer training programs in clean energy manufacturing.

“Investments in skilled workforce training not only help fill a vital need for employers but also offer life-changing opportunities for students looking for a pathway to a good-paying job,” said Heartland Community College President Keith Cornille. “Manufacturing Training Academy grant funding supercharged the Heartland Community College effort to develop our leading-edge EV Technology program. We were able to leverage that funding to create facilities for a variety of advanced manufacturing training programs for high-demand job sectors. By strengthening our Career Technical Education programs, we’ve offered our students a pathway to a job, that can stack into a better job, and eventually a career.”

Eligible applicants include community colleges outside of Cook and the collar counties, excluding previous MTA awardees. Through this competitive NOFO, qualified entities can apply for grants from $3 million to $6 million. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until April 30, 2026, at 5:00 p.m. or until funds are exhausted. To view the NOFO and apply for the grant, please visit the DCEO website. Interested parties are encouraged to reach out to CEO.GrantHelp@illinois.gov for application assistance. DCEO will be hosting a technical assistance session on January 28, 2026, at 2:00 p.m. to provide assistance, answer questions, and provide information on becoming GATA pre-qualified.

“Illinois community colleges are uniquely positioned to help power the state’s manufacturing future,” said Brian Durham, Executive Director of the Illinois Community College Board. “Through programs like the Manufacturing Training Academies, we’re connecting education and industry to deliver hands-on, high-tech training that meets the evolving needs of employers and opening opportunities to well-paying careers for Illinois residents.”

“Illinois’ longstanding leadership in manufacturing is powered by the strength and skill of our workforce,” said Illinois EDC President and CEO Christy George. “This new round of funding empowers our community colleges to deliver cutting-edge training for high-demand, high-quality jobs, ensuring Illinois remains competitive today while building the workforce that drives our economy.”",https://977wmoi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IL-StateSeal.jpeg,N,,2026-01-06 19:58:57.279213

It proposed gutting the National Science Foundation with a 57% funding cut, but lawmakers agreed to just a 3% trimming.
Trump looked to eliminate forest and rangeland research at the U.S. Forest Service, but the spending package would fully fund the efforts at $308 million.","Congress has unveiled a new package of bills to fund some agencies through fiscal 2026, the latest bipartisan breakthrough as lawmakers seek to avert another government shutdown at the end of the month.

The bill would set line-by-line, component-by-component spending levels across the departments of Commerce, Energy, Interior and Justice, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Forest Service, NASA and other agencies. Combined with the first full-year spending package Trump signed into law in November, Congress, if it approves the newest “minibus,” will have enacted half of the 12 annual must-pass appropriations bills. Remaining agencies are still operating under a continuing resolution that is set to expire Jan. 30 and appropriators are still negotiating over those measures.

Lawmakers have agreed to overall spending levels slightly lower than those currently in place, leading to small cuts at many agencies. The reductions are far less severe than those proposed by President Trump, however, and provide more explicit direction to the Trump administration than did the full-year stopgap bill in place during fiscal 2025.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said it was vital Congress pass annual spending bills to avoid ceding power to the Trump administration in making funding choices.

“Importantly, passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and [Office of Management and Budget Director] Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent—by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions,” Murray said.

The administration could still seek to subvert the spending authorized in the bill by submitting rescission packages to Congress.

The House is set to vote on the package on Thursday and is poised to send it to the Senate, which is expected to then act on it in the following days. Here is a look at the most significant outcomes for federal agencies in the bills:

Small cuts

While Democrats largely fended off the massive cuts President Trump and House Republicans had sought, they still accepted some reductions. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the package of bills was “not perfect” and conceded that “we had to make tough decisions when it comes to what programs to cut and what to protect.” The Environmental Protection Agency would see its funding decreased by 4%, though its budget level would still be $4.7 billion more than Trump proposed. NASA would see its funding cut by 2%, though its core functions would survive. The Energy Department would see its funding remain virtually flat, rejecting the nearly $4 billion cut Trump wanted.

Pumping the brakes on reorganizations

Lawmakers rejected Trump’s efforts to reshape agencies throughout government. The president proposed merging all wildfire fighting efforts into one agency and last year signed an executive order to that effect. Lawmakers specifically blocked that proposal, however, opting to instead maintain the current structure in which federal firefighting operations occur at the U.S. Forest Service within the Agriculture Department, the Interior Department and other agencies. Congress required a study into the feasibility of Trump’s proposal, including how it would differ from the current leadership provided by the National Interagency Fire Center.

The Trump administration also hoped to merge the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with the Drug Enforcement Administration but Congress killed the effort in the spending package. The Interior Department is in the midst of consolidating thousands of employees away from their bureaus and into the Office of the Secretary, though lawmakers instructed it that any shift of more than 10 employees required Interior to go through the formal reprogramming process. At NASA, the package “directs NASA to provide a briefing on the future of NASA Headquarters, including any plans for NASA to move staff outside of the Washington D.C. region,” lawmakers said in a statement accompanying the bill.

Science survives

In several instances, the White House had looked to decimate spending on scientific efforts at federal agencies. It proposed gutting the National Science Foundation with a 57% funding cut, but lawmakers agreed to just a 3% trimming. The Office of Science within Energy would have seen a $1 billion cut under Trump’s proposal, but lawmakers rejected the suggestion. The president sought to cut NASA’s science budget in half, but lawmakers largely left it in place. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would receive nearly $1.7 billion more than Trump requested.

Rebuilding workforces

The Trump administration has slashed workforces in agencies across government and Congress is now looking to unwind some of those efforts. The National Park Service has shed nearly one-quarter of its permanent staff in the last year, but Congress requested briefings on staffing levels every 60 days and Democrats said the funding was meant to restore staffing to fiscal 2024 levels. The Indian Health Service would receive $38 million to ensure adequate staffing at new facilities. Lawmakers noted in a bipartisan statement accompanying the bill that they were “deeply concerned” about staffing at the National Weather Service and provided $10 million to ensure all Weather Forecast Offices are fully staffed. Congress said the cuts “jeopardize the ability to maintain 24/7 operational coverage critical for timely and accurate weather forecasting, warnings, and emergency response.”

Lawmakers also voiced concerns about the workforce levels within the Executive Office of Immigration Review, the Justice Department agency that houses the nation’s immigration courts, and asked for updates on federal officials being detailed to serve as judges.

Eliminating eliminations

Congress is looking to mostly reject Trump’s effort to kill off federal entities and programs. The White House sought to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, but Congress opted to keep both flat funded with $207 million for each. Trump looked to eliminate forest and rangeland research at the U.S. Forest Service, but the spending package would fully fund the efforts at $308 million. The president would have nearly eliminated climate research at NOAA, but Congress opted to provide $224 million for the projects.

At Energy, Trump requested a nearly 75% to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, but lawmakers are seeking a more modest 10% cut. Trump would have eliminated the department’s Weatherization Assistance Program, which seeks to lower energy costs for low-income households by improving efficiency, but Congress instead boosted its funding.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/06/010626_Getty_GovExec_MinibusTakeaways/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 18:13:50.684516

AMY GOODMAN: You wrote a piece in September, “The U.S. Is Forfeiting the Clean-Energy Race to China.” Explain.
AMY GOODMAN: You wrote a piece, “Trump’s War on Wind Has This Construction Crew Stuck 15 Miles Out at Sea.” DAVID UBERTI: Right.
Over the last several years, Amazon, specifically Amazon Web Services, has turned Umatilla and the surrounding area into a massive hub for its data centers.
There’s an increasing number of people who are actually working at the data centers themselves, though that’s a smaller number of people.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.

In mid-December, the Trump administration announced it’s pausing leases for all large offshore wind farms under construction, citing national security risks. Ted Kelly, lead counsel for clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in response, “For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country’s need for electricity is surging,” he said.

The Trump administration’s order impacts five projects being built in the Atlantic Ocean, including a Virginia offshore wind farm that was set to be completed by the end of this year. Virginia has the largest concentration of data centers in the world, leading to soaring energy costs.

We’re continuing our conversation with Wall Street Journal reporter David Uberti, who has been closely following this story. If you can talk about, on the one hand, President Trump stopping renewable energy wind farms off the coast, and, on the other hand, investing — his family investing in nuclear fusion companies?

DAVID UBERTI: No one disputes that AI data centers require a huge amount of power. The question is how you go about producing that power. There’s some evidence and some arguments to be made that if you actually manage that correctly, it won’t affect energy prices in a big way. That said, taking existing power projects offline or sort of scrambling the pipeline for additional power projects in the future, the argument from renewable energy folks is that this will put upward pressure on prices. You have this well-established demand coming for new power, and these projects that are essentially ready to go, if not currently in construction right now, are basically being scrapped or put on pause.

AMY GOODMAN: And this lack of interest in oil, that President Trump is now pushing even more as he says he is running Venezuela.

DAVID UBERTI: Yeah, I mean, if you talk to big hyperscalers who work in this place, the Microsofts, the Alphabets of the world, they are interested in getting power fast and cheaply. In some circumstances, that might be natural gas. But in many circumstances, that could be renewable energy, that could be solar power, that could be wind power, whatever the case may be. What’s happening now is, in some circumstances, those choices are being constricted, depending on where those companies are operating.

AMY GOODMAN: You wrote a piece in September, “The U.S. Is Forfeiting the Clean-Energy Race to China.” Explain.

DAVID UBERTI: There was an idea during the Biden administration that Beijing had essentially taken control of these massive and increasingly important supply chains for things like solar panels, things for the — like the turbines and nacelles that go into wind farms, and that because of that, they were able to exert a large amount of power over especially developing countries around the world, as well as Europe, in ways that the U.S. had done previously with oil. The Biden administration’s plan was to basically invigorate the domestic industry to both produce cleaner energy, but also manufacture all of the things that you need to produce that energy. That was the Inflation Reduction Act.

Of course, President Trump has more or less scrapped all of that, which has thrown the renewable energy industry into turmoil over the last year or so. There’s still a ton of solar development, in particular, battery advancements happening in the United States, as well. But a lot of the existing projects that were happening last year, and especially those manufacturing projects that would create jobs and theoretically produce the material and the parts needed to actually build out this energy, this energy domestically, a lot of those manufacturing projects no longer exist.

AMY GOODMAN: You wrote a piece, “Trump’s War on Wind Has This Construction Crew Stuck 15 Miles Out at Sea.”

DAVID UBERTI: Right. So, there’s been fits and starts of the Trump administration’s push against offshore wind. You mentioned the stated securities concerns, which the industry totally disputes. The piece you mentioned was over the summer, and the one word that came to mind when reporting it was “Kafkaesque.”

The Trump administration more or less halted projects that were taking place off the coast of New York, where we are. And I spoke to a guy who was actually on one of the vessels out there, and he said, “Look, we’re kind of just sitting out here twiddling our thumbs.” So, what you have is these construction crews on very expensive boats working on a very expensive project that are not able to build it going forward. So, I spoke to a guy there, a young guy. He said, “We’re basically playing video games and working out four times a day.”

And it’s funny on one level, but also immensely sad on others, mostly for the workers, who have no idea of what the future holds for this industry, that they oftentimes had to get additional training for and really staked a lot of their livelihoods around in terms of scheduling when they get to see their kids, going on and offshore for months and months and months at a time. That’s the sort of chaos that has played out within the renewable energy sector, particularly for offshore wind, which the Trump administration has taken aim at with a specific amount of force over the last year.

AMY GOODMAN: And why? Why this enormous hostility? Is it just President Trump’s devotion to oil? You know, obviously, one of his mantras during his campaign was “drill, baby, drill.”

DAVID UBERTI: He has brought back “drill, baby, drill” into popular lexicon, of course. It’s important to say that there is a lot of local opposition to some of these projects, on the grounds of “it will ruin my view off of the coastline, it will be difficult for my boat to navigate these things. Potentially, these turbines could disintegrate into the water, which could pose some environmental problems.

That said, Trump’s animus for offshore wind has a personal connotation, as well, and it stretches back more than a decade, at least, to when there was an offshore wind project off of one of his golf courses abroad, which he tried, unsuccessfully, to stop. So he is in that camp of people who oppose these things because it — you know, I think he said, “It ruins your neighborhood. It brings down your property values,” in addition to sort of the oil-focused energy policy of the administration, generally speaking.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to your piece right around election time, “What Happened When Small-Town America Became Data Center, U.S.A.” Talk about Umatilla, Oregon.

DAVID UBERTI: Umatilla, Oregon, is a small, small town in northeast Oregon, about three hours east of Portland. It’s roughly 8,000 people. Not a lot has been going on in Umatilla economically for the past decade or so. There’s a state prison there that houses about 2,000 people, incarcerated people. And besides that, for lack of a better term, it’s sort of a pass-through town for truckers who are going to Portland.

Over the last several years, Amazon, specifically Amazon Web Services, has turned Umatilla and the surrounding area into a massive hub for its data centers. It’s sort of strategically positioned between population centers in Portland, San Francisco and Seattle, with fiber-optic cable leading back to Umatilla. So, there’s something like more than a dozen, if not 18 or so, data center sites in Umatilla.

And now, what this has done, it has basically turned the surrounding area into a company town. There’s a lot of people working in construction. There’s an increasing number of people who are actually working at the data centers themselves, though that’s a smaller number of people. And despite the fact that these data centers have encountered a lot of opposition in different parts of the country, where there’s concerns about power, concerns about land use, etc., the people in Umatilla are very positive on what has happened there, in large part because there was not a lot happening in the local economy previously. There’s been a massive injection of capital into Umatilla, which has created jobs. If you’re a homeowner, it has boosted your home value. And it’s created a lot of other offshoot businesses for people in town. I talked to a real estate agent, for example, who basically previously worked in a Walmart distribution center and has, over the last couple of years, become one of the most successful real estate agents in town. It’s been huge for people like her.

AMY GOODMAN: And then I think about the Ponca Tribe in Oklahoma taking on data centers; Justin Pearson, the state legislator in Tennessee, who led a movement in Memphis, because they felt that the energy sources for mass data center were compromising their communities, particularly communities of color. And then you think about President Trump issuing this executive order saying you cannot regulate, at a local level, at a state level, data centers, but that also goes to the energy for them.

DAVID UBERTI: Right. I mean, I think you raise a good point here. I mean, the main thing a data center needs are land, water and power. And how each of those play out on any individual circumstances really relies on the local community. What are the climate issues surrounding the local community? Is it a hot area? Is it a cold area? Are there abundant water resources nearby? Does the state or the surrounding region have a lot of power plants that are ready or are being able to be built? These things are inherently local issues. And so, you see these companies, the Big Tech giants, they’re increasingly trying to boost their outreach to some of these places, sometimes unsuccessfully. Some communities want data centers. They want the economic development. Other communities have huge concerns about the power needs or other questions they have around data centers. So, yeah, I think you do see this tension of the sort of give and take between local regulation and sort of the local community imperatives that you might see on a city or state level, versus what the U.S. technology and national security strategy might be.

AMY GOODMAN: And the billionaire brotherhood of the tech moguls who support President Trump, not wanting to deal with community after community, and then the Trump family themselves, when it comes to nuclear fusion powering AI data centers, President Trump then stopping renewable energy sources, for example, off the coast of Virginia, which has more data centers than anywhere in the country.

DAVID UBERTI: Yeah, it’s interesting. After I wrote that piece about Oregon, I spoke with Richard Blumenthal, the senator, who is among a group of senators who have basically said, “Hey, we need to take a close look at this, and we don’t really like the way the administration is carrying this out,” for all the concerns that you’ve just mentioned.

If I were to look in my crystal ball for 2026 and 2028, I would bet that this is an emerging political issue, especially on the political left. It’s not only what do we want the data center industry to look like, where are these things built, etc. It’s what role do we want AI to play in the modern economy, and whether that will create jobs in certain industries or maybe wipe entire industries off the map entirely. I think especially among Bernie Sanders and some of the more left-wing elements of the Democratic Party, they take an increasingly strong line against this. And I wouldn’t be surprised that that becomes a more mainstream position in the months and years ahead.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/blog_posts/73/80473/full_hd/DavidUbertiWind.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 19:00:13.736939

The Obama administration leveraged American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding to spur the EV market, with the goal of 1 million EVs on America’s roads by 2015. In the first Trump administration, EVs were mocked, and the administration sought to undo incentives, supportive policies, and regulations that were accelerating the EV transition. The Biden administration enacted the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which spurred unprecedented private-sector investment in EV, battery, and supply chain manufacturing and job growth. The second Trump administration has been more successful at undoing EV-related policy progress, sowing market uncertainty at a time when global EV adoption is rising, and Chinese auto manufacturers are dominating the market.

2025 Was a Bit Bumpy, but Drivable

The uncertainty caused by political whipsawing is taking its toll, adding pressure to a nascent market that is navigating the complex transition from petroleum to electric-powered transportation. That added pressure is delaying or rescinding some manufacturing investments; slowing the pace of new investments; pushing back timelines for releasing new, next-generation models; and prompting some automakers to scrap plans altogether. Despite headwinds, many start-up EV manufacturers, such as Rivian, Slate, and Scout, continue to push ahead, focusing on affordable, innovative vehicles, while legacy automakers like General Motors and Hyundai experience record EV sales.

Regarding charging infrastructure deployments, the Trump administration clawed back previously appropriated funding for the $5B National EV Infrastructure (NEVI) program and the $2.5 Community Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) program, prompting lawsuits that have led to at least some of the funding resuming. Despite the slowdown of NEVI and CFI progress, the private sector has been deploying a record number of public charging stations while significantly improving reliability.

Though the EV headlines in 2025 may make you think the EV sky is falling, the data shows otherwise. Case in point: SACE and Atlas Public Policy’s 6th annual Transportation Electrification in the Southeast Report indicates that the Southeastern US remains a hub for EV-related manufacturing, investment, and jobs, as EV sales continue to grow year over year and charging station deployment expands.

Three Signs and a Wildcard to Watch in 2026

Market volatility is almost certain to continue into 2026 as companies navigate a shifting policy landscape and broader economic factors, including tariffs and inflation, which are working against the auto industry as a whole, including EVs. Meanwhile, here are three signs to keep an eye on:

EV owner satisfaction. EV owners’ satisfaction with EV value and performance is critical. The good news is that 92% of EV owners plan to buy another EV for their next car. Given that most new EV purchases are leases, most EV drivers will replace their EV every three years. High satisfaction indicates automakers have a strong base of committed EV consumers who understand the ABCs of EVs: affordable, better, and convenient.

Consumer demand. There needs to be a steady stream of new consumers being drawn to EVs for the market to grow. The good news is that consumer demand has held steady, with 24.2% of new-car shoppers reporting they are very likely to consider an EV. In fact, the percentage of very likely shoppers has held relatively steady all year despite the anti-EV political rhetoric and negative headlines.

The used EV market. Only one-third of car shoppers buy new cars; the rest buy used. Until now, there hasn’t been a robust used market. But in 2025, 243,000 EV leases will end, more than 3 times the number that ended in 2024. In 2026 and beyond, the used EV market will continue to expand rapidly as the surge in new EV leases over the past five years drives growth in the used market. Used EVs already compete with gas vehicles on price and outperform them on value, meaning many consumers priced out of the new-vehicle market now have access to more affordable EV ownership.

Along with watching the three signs, we are waiting for the wildcard to be dealt: the 2026 mid-term elections. Affordability remains a priority for Americans, regardless of political ideology. In the recent November elections, voters ousted incumbents they blamed for rising bills and elected candidates they trusted to make life more affordable. With voters demanding that elected officials address affordability and consumer interest in EVs remaining unshakeable, the EV market may have a wildcard up its sleeve: The best way for consumers to lower their energy and transportation costs is to ditch gas and switch to EVs, especially used ones. In November 2026, consumers will have the chance to vote for candidates who support getting America back on the path to affordable electric transportation.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-06 14:59:49.060209

This week, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives will convene and begin the second session of the 119th U.S. Congress. With the beginning of the new year underway, all attention will quickly turn to the January 30, 2026, funding deadline. Passage of another continuing resolution (CR) or passage of full-year appropriations for agencies that only received short-term funding in the previous CR will be necessary to fund large portions of the government beyond the end of this month. The potential for passage of a CR being passed is significant, with conference negotiations ongoing between Senate and House appropriations leaders regarding fiscal year (FY) 2026 appropriations subcommittee bills. Although Senate Republicans and Democrats were unable to reach a unanimous consent agreement in December 2025 to advance a five-bill spending package covering Defense, Labor-Health and Human Services-Education, Commerce-Justice-Science, Transportation-Housing and Urban Development, and Interior-Environment, Senate and House appropriations recently announced agreement on a consolidated Energy and Water, Interior, and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills.

Upon its return, the Senate is expected to hold two Congressional Review Act (CRA) votes, as well as vote on several nominees for whom cloture was filed prior to the recess. Meanwhile, the House will vote on legislation advanced by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce related to housing and certain home fixtures, as well as the ""minibus"" package containing the Energy and Water, Interior, and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills. The House is also expected to hold a vote in the days and weeks ahead on a three-year extension of the enhanced advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) following a discharge petition that gained the support of several key Republicans, forcing a vote on the measure.

Upcoming Events

The House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health will hold a hearing titled ""Legislative Proposals to Support Patient Access to Medicare Services."" The hearing will focus on the following bills:

Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2025 (H.R.1703), introduced by Rep. John Joyce (R-Pa.)

DMEPOS Relief Act of 2025 (H.R.2005), introduced by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa)

Administrative Updates

Executive Order Updates

The Trump Administration has continued to release wide-ranging executive orders (EOs). For the latest updates, see our ""Trump's 2025 Executive Orders: Updates and Summaries"" tracking chart.

December 18, 2025: President Donald Trump announced an EO titled ""Increasing Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research."" The EO directs the U.S. attorney general to take all necessary steps to complete the rulemaking process related to rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to Schedule III of the CSA. The EO also directs the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Legislative, Political and Public Affairs to work with Congress to update the statutory definition of final hemp-derived cannabinoid products to increase access as appropriate to cannabidiol (CBD) products.

Trump Administration Awards $50 Billion under Rural Health Transformation Program

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced $50 billion in awards under the Rural Health Transformation Program, which was established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), the Republican reconciliation law enacted in 2025. All 50 states will receive awards ranging from $147 million to $281 million beginning in 2026, with the full $50 billion distributed over a 10-year period. The program was included in the legislation to address concerns raised by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and other Republicans about the potential impact of the OBBB on rural hospitals and individuals living in rural communities.

CMS also announced the creation of the Office of Rural Health Transformation. The office will oversee management of the Rural Health Transformation Program and includes a Division of State Rural Engagement that will provide policy and operational guidance to states and other stakeholders.

GAO Report on Distribution of New GME Positions

The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report examining the initial distribution of new Medicare-funded physician residency positions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 required CMS to allocate 1,000 new Medicare-funded graduate medical education (GME) residency positions to qualifying hospitals through permanent increases to resident caps. To date, CMS has distributed 600 of the 1,000 positions across three annual application cycles. The majority of awarded positions were allocated to hospitals in urban areas, and approximately half supported primary care training. Of the 393 hospitals that applied, about half received new residency positions.

MFN Drug Pricing Initiative Expansion Announced

President Trump announced an expansion of the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) Drug Pricing Initiative on December 19, 2025, heralding new drug price agreements with nine new drug manufacturers. Three drug manufacturers that received letters from the Trump Administration regarding the prices of their prescription drugs have yet to publicly announce drug pricing agreements with the administration.

As part of the agreement, the nine manufacturers entered into a ""voluntary"" package that mirrors earlier MFN deals while expanding the scope of commitments. Under the agreement, selected products will be offered to consumers at reduced prices through the TrumpRx.gov platform, which is expected to launch in January 2026. In addition, state Medicaid programs will receive access to MFN pricing for a defined subset of products, with company-specific press releases indicating that this component would be implemented through the GENErating cost Reductions fOr U.S. Medicaid (GENEROUS) Model for Medicaid.

The agreement also includes commitments related to pricing, supply chain security and domestic investment. New medicines will be launched in the U.S. at MFN-aligned prices, and in a new development, several manufacturers agreed to donate active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve (SAPIR) to bolster national security and supply chain resilience. Collectively, the nine companies are committed to investing at least $150 billion in U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing in the near term. In exchange for reaching an agreement, participating manufacturers will receive three-year exemptions from potential Section 232 tariffs on pharmaceutical products and ingredients.

Personnel Updates

Thomas Bell has been confirmed as Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) has stepped down as Ranking Member of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the U.S. and China. Rep. Krishnamoorthi previously entered the race to fill Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) seat in the Senate, as Sen. Durbin announced he will retire at the end of his term. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) will replace him as the top Democrat on the committee.

Congressional Updates

January 30, 2026, Funding Deadline Approaches

Senate and House leaders will have to quickly confront the looming January 30, 2026, funding deadline. Following the expiration of the enhanced APTCs on December 31, 2025, some support continued efforts to renew and extend the APTCs to include the potential for another government shutdown. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) threw cold water on that potential path forward, describing ""two separate tracks"" for proceeding on government funding, with one path being funding the government for a full year and working in a ""bipartisan, bicameral"" way to do so. Sen. Schumer also signaled willingness to work on lowering the cost of healthcare but continued to oppose proposals offered by Republicans that do not include an extension of the APTCs.

A bill to fund the government beyond January 30, 2026, will require a majority vote in the House – which continues to be in Republican hands – as well as require 60 votes in the Senate, necessitating support of a handful of Senate Democrats. The eight Senate Democrats who voted in favor of the CR that ended the previous government shutdown will likely confront much pressure to vote for – or against – another CR, given the expiration of the enhanced APTCs.

NDAA Signed into Law

President Trump has signed the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law following months of negotiation between the two chambers of Congress on a compromise version of the must-pass annual defense policy bill. The law includes a provision that will bar Chinese ""biotechnology companies of concern"" from receiving federal funding. A previous version of the legislation known as the BIOSECURE Act was omitted from 2025's NDAA due to concerns about naming specific biotech companies to be scrutinized. The final NDAA would require the Office of Management and Budget to create a list of biotech companies – like those on the U.S. Department of Defense's list of Chinese military companies – that would be blocked from federal contracts, grants or loans, and to provide the companies the opportunity to appeal.

Regulatory Updates

CDC Acting Director Accepts Recommendations to Change Childhood Immunization Practices

Acting Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Jim O'Neill signed a decision memorandum on January 5, 2026, accepting recommendations on changes to U.S. childhood immunization practices. The memorandum, authored by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary, details findings from a scientific assessment in support of changes to the number and types of vaccines children are recommended to receive. The memorandum recommends a schedule of ""consensus vaccines"" for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenza type B, pneumoccal disease, human papillomavirus and varicella. The memorandum makes additional recommendations, noting that certain vaccines including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, meningoccal disease, influenza and COVID-19, be based on ""shared clinical decision making.""

CMS Announces GLOBE and GUARD Models to Reduce Prescription Drug Prices

The CMS Innovation Center (CMMI) announced proposed rules on December 20, 2025, for two mandatory models. The models would implement MFN-based pricing in Medicare Part B and Part D. Comments on both proposals are due by February 23, 2026.

The GUARD Model

The Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD) Model is intended to assess whether an alternative approach to calculating inflation rebates for certain Part D drugs and biological products can lower Medicare program spending while maintaining or improving enrollee access and quality of care. The model would require manufacturers to pay a GUARD Model Rebate when a drug's Medicare net price exceeds an applicable international benchmark. Rebates would apply when U.S. prices are higher than prices paid in comparable countries.

CMS proposes two approaches to establish international benchmarks using pricing data from 19 economically comparable Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Method I (Default) would use the lowest country-level average price identified through available international data sources while Method II (Optional) allows manufacturers to submit confidential international net pricing data, with CMS using the across-country average net price if it exceeds the default benchmark.

The GUARD Model would be tested over a five-year performance period, launching January 1, 2027, and running through December 31, 2031, with rebate invoicing and reconciliation continuing into 2033. The model would test modifications to the Part D inflation rebate calculation for certain drugs included in the Medicare Part D Drug Inflation Rebate Program, focusing on sole-source drugs and sole-source biologics in specified therapeutic categories which would encompass among others: analgesics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antimigraine agents, antineoplastics, antipsychotics, antivirals, bipolar agents, blood glucose regulators, cardiovascular agents, central nervous system (CNS) agents, gastrointestinal agents, immunological agents, metabolic bone disease agents, ophthalmic agents, respiratory/pulmonary agents and treatments for genetic, enzyme or protein disorders.

The GUARD model would exclude 1) generics and biosimilars, 2) sole-source drugs or biologics below the minimum spend threshold, and 3) drugs subject to a negotiated maximum fair price during the applicable price period. Drug units, subject to a 340B pricing agreement, would also be excluded from the model.

The model would apply in randomly selected geographic areas covering approximately 25 percent of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. CMS estimates the GUARD Model would reduce Medicare spending by $14.1 billion over the 2028-2033 period.

The GLOBE Model

The Global Benchmark for Efficient Drug Pricing (GLOBE) Model is designed to test whether an alternative method for calculating Part B inflation rebates for certain separately payable drugs and biological products can reduce costs for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and the Medicare program while preserving or enhancing quality of care. As part of the model, manufacturer rebates would be triggered when a drug's price exceeds an applicable international benchmark derived from prices paid in comparable countries. The model would operate for five years, beginning October 1, 2026, and running through 2031, with rebate invoicing and reconciliation extending into 2033.

The model would focus on high-expenditure Part B rebatable drugs, limited to single-source drugs and sole-source biological products. Included drugs must fall within one of seven U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) Drug Classification categories: antigout agents, antineoplastics, blood products and modifiers, CNS agents, immunological agents, metabolic bone disease agents and ophthalmic agents. Only drugs with annual Medicare Part B fee-for-service (FFS) allowed charges exceeding $100 million would be included. CMS would establish benchmarks using prices from the same 19 OECD countries and proposes two methods for calculation: 1) Method I (Default) would use the lowest GDP-adjusted country-level price, increased by a 102 percent adjustment factor, and 2) Method II (Optional) would use a manufacturer-submitted, volume-weighted average net price, increased by a 105 percent adjustment factor.

CMS proposes excluding drugs with Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II codes when payment is based on a negotiated maximum fair price under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. As part of the proposed rule and through the open public comment period, CMS requests feedback on a number of areas, including whether certain product types (e.g., cell and gene therapies or plasma-derived products) should be excluded.

The model would be implemented in randomly selected geographic areas representing approximately 25 percent of Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries. CMS projects $11.9 billion in total federal savings over the model period, including approximately $8.4 billion in Part B benefit savings and $1.4 billion in reduced beneficiary cost sharing.

DEA Issues Fourth Temporary Extension for Telemedicine

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published a notice in the Federal Register on December 30, 2025, announcing an extension through December 31, 2026, of COVID-19 telemedicine flexibilities for the prescribing of Schedule II-V controlled substances. The extension will allow DEA registered practitioners to continue prescribing Schedule II-V controlled substances without requiring an in-person medical evaluation if certain conditions are met, such as prescriptions are issued for a legitimate medical purpose and a prescription is issued by a provider authorized to prescribe the class of controlled substance. This is the fourth temporary extension of these COVID-19 telemedicine flexibilities. The DEA notes that the extension is an effort to prevent disruptions of care, prevent a backlog of patients who need in-person appointments and allow adequate time for potential, future implementation of in-person medical evaluation requirements.

FDA Issues New Guidance on Real World Evidence for Certain Submissions

The FDA issued draft guidance on December 15, 2025, of how the agency will accept Real World Evidence (RWE) for certain types of medical device submissions without requiring the submission of identifiable, patient-level data as part of a marketing submission. FDA indicated in the same guidance that it intends to update guidance for drugs and biologics to mirror the consideration of RWE. The draft guidance notes FDA will now accept real-world evidence in drug and device submissions that do not include identifiable, individual patient data collected from real-world data sources. This change increases the possibility that the use of de-identified databases with patient records may be used as a resource for sponsors during the submission process.

FDA Sends Letters to Dietary Supplement Companies, Loosens Certain Warning Requirements

In a December 11, 2025, letter to dietary supplement manufacturers, distributors and retailers, FDA announced it is considering requests to amend labeling guidelines for dietary supplement disclaimers. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), certain statements for dietary supplements may be made if they indicate prominently and in bold that the product ""has not been evaluated by the FDA"" and is ""not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease."" FDA shares it has completed an initial review of the regulation and expects that removing the requirement for the DSHEA disclaimer ""would be consistent"" with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act as well as reduce ""label clutter and unnecessary costs."" The issuance of a proposed rule to amend the DSHEA disclaimer is contingent upon a continued review of available data and information. In the interim, FDA will exercise enforcement discretion regarding the DSHEA disclaimer and will not enforce requirements related to the requirement.

FDA Medical Gases CGMP Guidance

FDA issued draft guidance titled ""Medical Gases – Current Good Manufacturing Practice"" intended to support the manufacturers of medical gases in complying with current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs). The guidance revises and replaces previous guidance to include clarifications regarding supplier capabilities, protecting against leakage, cleaning and maintenance, as well as testing for expiration and handling returned or salvaged gases.

FDA Issues Draft Guidance for Cosmetics Industry on Recalls

FDA issued draft guidance on December 18, 2025, for the cosmetics industry regarding recalls as it relates to Section 611 of the FD&C Act, as well as FDA's thinking about its implementation. The draft guidance lays out a variety of questions and details FDA's answers, including the cosmetics subject to mandatory recalls, who FDA considers a ""responsible person"" under Section 611 of the FD&C Act, as well as the criteria FDA will consider when determining to invoke its mandatory recall authority. Comments on the draft guidance must be submitted by February 17, 2026.

The issuance of the draft guidance preceded a new report published by FDA on December 29, 2025, titled ""Report on the Use of PFAS in Cosmetic Products and Associated Risks."" The report summarizes FDA's assessment of certain chemicals in cosmetic products called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which was mandated by Section 3506 of the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (MoCRA). The report identified 51 different PFAS currently in use as cosmetic product ingredients and includes safety evaluations for the 25 most used PFAS ingredients. FDA found in its assessment that safety conclusions couldn't be reached for the vast majority of PFAS due to incomplete or unavailable toxicological data.

HHS Releases New RFI, Solicits Comments on Adoption and Acceleration of AI in Clinical Care

HHS issued a new request for information (RFI) in the Federal Register on December 19, 2025, titled ""Accelerating the Adoption and Use of Artificial Intelligence as part of Clinical Care,"" with a 60-day window to comment. The RFI solicits comments on the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) for clinical care, reimbursement, research and development, and asks the following specific questions:

What are the biggest barriers to private sector innovation in AI for healthcare and its adoption and use in clinical care?

What regulatory, payment policy or programmatic design changes should HHS prioritize to incentivize the effective use of AI in clinical care and why? What HHS regulations, policies or programs could be revisited to augment your ability to develop or use AI in clinical care? Please provide specific changes and applicable Code of Federal Regulations citations.

For non-medical devices, it's understood that use of AI in clinical care may raise novel legal and implementation issues that challenge existing governance and accountability structures (e.g., relating to liability, indemnification, privacy and security). What novel legal and implementation issues exist and what role, if any, should HHS play to help address them?

For non-medical devices, what are the most promising AI evaluation methods (pre- and post-deployment), metrics, robustness testing and other workflow and human-centered evaluation methods for clinical care? Should HHS further support these processes? If so, which mechanisms would be most impactful (e.g., contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and/or prize competitions)?

How can HHS best support private sector activities (e.g., accreditation, certification, industry driven testing and credentialing) to promote innovative and effective AI use in clinical care?

Where have AI tools deployed in clinical care met or exceeded performance and cost expectations and where have they fallen short? What kinds of novel AI tools would have the greatest potential to improve healthcare outcomes, give new insights on quality and help reduce costs?

Which role(s), decision maker(s) or governing bodies within healthcare organizations have the most influence on the adoption of AI for clinical care? What are the primary administrative hurdles to the adoption of AI in clinical care?

Where would enhanced interoperability widen market opportunities, fuel research and accelerate the development of AI for clinical care? Please consider specific data types, data standards and benchmarking tools.

What challenges within healthcare do patients and caregivers wish to see addressed by the adoption and use of AI in clinical care? Equally, what concerns do patients and caregivers have related to the adoption and use of AI in clinical care?

Are there specific areas of AI research that HHS should prioritize to accelerate the adoption of AI as part of clinical care?Are there published findings about the impact of adopted AI tools and their use clinical care? How does the literature approach the costs, benefits and transfers of using AI as part of clinical care?

CMS Announces ACO REACH Model to Transition to ACO LEAD

CMS announced that the Accountable Care Organization Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (ACO REACH) model will transition to a new model, ACO Long-term Enhanced ACO Design (LEAD), a 10-year initiative with an emphasis on high-needs beneficiaries. ACO LEAD is designed to launch on January 1, 2027, following the conclusion of ACO REACH, with applications expected to open in March 2026. CMS has outlined several key design elements for ACO LEAD, including improved integration of high-needs patients through more accurate risk adjustment and benchmarking across all ACOs, as well as two risk-sharing options: global risk (100 percent upside and downside risk) and professional risk (50 percent upside and downside risk).

The model also introduces new healthy living flexibilities intended to encourage beneficiaries to seek care from high-value providers. These flexibilities include Part B cost-sharing support, Medical Nutrition Therapy benefits and – beginning in 2029 – a Part D premium buy-down. In addition, ACO LEAD will test Medicaid integration for dually eligible beneficiaries through ACO-Medicaid partnership arrangements with two states. Notably, the model establishes CMS-Administered Risk Arrangements (CARA), which will allow for episode-based risk arrangements between ACOs and selected care providers. While additional details are forthcoming, ACO LEAD introduces several programmatic design elements – particularly CARA – that signal a meaningful evolution in CMS' value-based care strategy.

Judge Issues Preliminary Injunction to Block 340B Rebate Model Pilot Program

U.S. District Court for the District of Maine Chief Judge Lance Walker issued a preliminary injunction on December 29, 2025, blocking the 340B rebate pilot scheduled to begin January 1, 2026. The court found the pilot was likely to violate the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA) arbitrary and capricious standard, citing a ""hastily assembled"" rollout and an inadequate administrative record. The 340B Rebate Model Pilot Program is intended to change how hospitals receive rebates for certain drugs, shifting the current rebate from being provided upfront to a rebate post-purchase.

As a result, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is temporarily barred from allowing the nine participating drug manufacturers to replace long-standing upfront 340B discounts with after-the-fact rebates. In his order, Judge Walker emphasized that HRSA likely failed to adequately consider or explain the impact of a rebate-based model on 340B hospitals, which rely on upfront discounts to stretch limited resources in service of rural and low-income communities. He concluded that the APA ""likely requires more"" from the agency.

The federal government had argued that any injunction should be limited to the plaintiff hospital organizations and their members. The court rejected that position, holding that under the APA, it has authority to preliminarily set aside the pilot program more broadly. The case was initially brought on December 1, 2025, by a trade association representing major hospitals, a state hospital association and several safety-net hospitals. The lawsuit alleged the program was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the APA.

Over the years, I came to believe that real energy change wouldn’t come from the top down, but from communities themselves. That belief is what led me to spend the last 17 years with the Troya Environmental Association, working to grow renewable energy cooperatives and put power – literally and politically – back into people’s hands.

In the last few years, Türkiye’s renewable energy scene has changed fast. By September 2025, the country’s total installed electricity capacity reached 121,418 MW, and our solar capacity doubled in just two and a half years. That’s huge. It shows clearly that Türkiye has massive renewable potential, and that we could be even more ambitious if we chose to be.

But big numbers alone don’t tell the full story. The real question is: who benefits from this growth? This is where energy cooperatives really matter. A 2025 report by 350 Türkiye shows that while the country aims to reach 120 GW of combined solar and wind capacity, getting there in a fair way – not just pumping out megawatts – depends on active citizen participation. Without people at the center, the energy transition risks becoming just another business model for the elites.

Right now, energy cooperatives in Türkiye face real challenges. The rules are complicated, the permits take forever, and the system clearly favors large investors. Even when communities come together to start a coop, getting grid access, licenses, and financing can be slow, frustrating, and uncertain. Many great ideas struggle just to survive.

That’s exactly why I joined the Empower Our Future campaign led by 350 Türkiye. This campaign is all about strengthening community power in the energy transition – supporting local groups and citizens to take control of how energy is produced and used. It pushes for fair rules for cooperatives, awareness around community energy, and a future where clean power isn’t owned by just a few, but shared by many.

When I think about the future I want for Türkiye, I don’t just imagine more solar panels and wind turbines. I imagine neighbourhoods and towns running their own microgrids. I imagine transparent, democratic energy systems where people actually get a say – and where the money generated stays in the community instead of flowing to distant corporations.

To make that future real, we need strong laws that support cooperatives, make licensing and grid access simpler, and open the door to real community ownership of energy. And we will get there – I’m confident we will make renewable energy cooperatives possible, accessible and easy to set up in Türkiye soon.",https://350.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-10.58.58-1024x793.png,N,,2026-01-06 19:59:01.451181

[13] View Rule: EPA/OAR Proposed Revision to “Begin Actual Construction” in the New Source Review Preconstruction Permitting Program, Office of Info.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has expressed its intent to propose a rule to revise the regulatory definition of “begin actual construction” under the Clean Air Act’s (CAA) New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program, with a proposed rule expected in 2026.[1] The EPA has indicated that the rule, if proposed and finalized, will provide “flexibility” to developers to begin construction on ancillary structures that are not themselves components of the emitting structures, such as concrete pads and external walls, before obtaining the requisite air permit.[2]

CAA permit reform arrives at a time when energy demand, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) development, data center expansion, and electrification, is projected to surge over the next decade.[3] Against this backdrop, the EPA’s potential permitting reform aims to provide stakeholders with greater flexibility for early-stage site developments and accelerated project timelines.

Regulatory Background

Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source of air pollutants cannot “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.[4] EPA regulations define “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit,” which “include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures.”[5]

For decades, the EPA interpreted this definition broadly. In a 1986 memorandum issued by then-EPA Director Edward Reich (the Reich memo), the agency adopted the position that the construction of structures “necessary to accommodate” emissions units could themselves constitute “actual construction” of emissions units and therefore trigger the need for an NSR permit.[6] The Reich memo effectively prohibited construction of structures that are not emission units — like footings, foundations, storage structures, and retaining walls — until developers obtained an NSR permit.

The result: often slower timelines and higher costs. Indeed, one study found that from 2002 to 2014, the average time to process an NSR permit was 420 days.[7] Of course, permitting timelines may vary depending on the type of project. For example, the same study found that natural gas permits on average were processed the fastest (319 days), whereas refinery project permits took the longest to assess (537 days).

In March 2020, however, the EPA issued draft guidance (the 2020 draft guidance) that adopted a less restrictive interpretation of the term “begin actual construction.”[8] Returning to the original regulatory text, the 2020 draft guidance confirmed that the only construction prohibited prior to issuance of an air permit is construction “on an emissions unit.” The EPA explained that its prior interpretations were “unnecessarily restrictive,” and that the revised interpretation “better conforms to the regulatory text” that defines “begin actual construction.”[9]

EPA Announces Permitting Reform

In September 2025, the EPA reaffirmed its 2020 guidance on the definition of “beginning actual construction” to provide “much needed clarity” and “flexibility,” motivated primarily by the global AI race.[10] EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that, “[f]or years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth” and identified “Permitting Reform” as a key pillar of the agency’s new “Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative.”[11] A stated goal of CAA permit reform is to promote the development of data centers “critical to making the U.S. the Artificial Intelligence (AI) capital of the world.”[12] A proposed rule to further clarify the meaning of “beginning actual construction” is expected by January 2026, with a final rule targeted for September 2026.[13] Proponents hope the rule will accelerate project timelines.

The latest guidance from the EPA is found in a letter to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) regarding a proposed semiconductor facility in Phoenix, Arizona (the TSMC letter).[14] MCAQD sought guidance from the EPA on whether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, could begin construction on the “core and shell” of the semiconductor facility — i.e., foundation, steel superstructure, and external walls — prior to MCAQD’s issuance of an NSR permit. TSMC agreed to defer the installation of semiconductor manufacturing equipment that could be classified as emissions units, foundations for such units, and piping until after the issuance of a permit.

The EPA referred back to its 2020 draft guidance and concluded that TSMC could proceed with the initial phase of construction because the structures to be built were not specifically configured for emissions units and therefore did not constitute “begin[ning] actual construction.”[15] But the EPA cautioned that any construction activities undertaken prior to issuance of an NSR permit would be at the developer’s “own risk” and that the developer’s “time and resources expended on construction prior to obtaining a permit” may not be used as justification to grant the air permit.[16] And until the EPA officially proposes and finalizes a rule, the EPA stated that it may advise on “begin actual construction” questions on a “case-by-case basis.”[17]

Takeaways

The effects of the EPA’s permitting reform will certainly vary by the particulars of a project, and likely by state as well, because state permitting agencies have broad discretion to enforce NSR requirements.[18] Developments that include significant non-emitting structures, such as manufacturing facilities and data centers, may benefit from accelerated timelines. However, construction of emission units cannot be completed without an NSR permit. And while permitting reform may allow for faster construction times, proceeding with pre-permit construction activities is unlikely to be a risk-free endeavor. At least in one response to a state agency — the MCAQD — the EPA expressed that the time and resources expended on pre-permit construction will not influence permitting decisions. Developers therefore retain potentially significant exposure by proceeding with construction of even non-emitting structures. Indeed, permits could impose conditions requiring modification to work that was already in progress or, even be outright denied.

While the full effects of the promised permitting reform will not be understood for some time, it is not too early for stakeholders to start to evaluate their potential risks and develop risk mitigation measures for their current and future projects. Potential risks that project participants may think through include:

Permit conditions that require modifying or rebuilding work already in progress

What happens to the project if a permit is delayed, or even denied outright

How risk and delay-related costs are allocated in both prime and downstream contracts (e.g., subcontracts and purchase orders), including, but not limited to, idle labor, storage and preservation of equipment, and extended insurance or bonding costs

Financing risks, such as the loss of financing or the inability to close on a construction loan due to permit delays or denial

Of course, each project brings with it unique circumstances, challenges, and risks, which may only be compounded as project stakeholders navigate permitting requirements.

Both Crockett and O’Rourke are the type of politician who can say “fuck” and make it sound right.
He could be the left candidate and the center candidate at will, the head and the heart of the party alike.","Much like how a sailor, lost and withering at sea, at least gets the chance to see the world, Texas’ ailing Democrats will get the chance this year to recreate some of the magic of the 2018 midterms.

You know the drill: Donald Trump’s in the second year of a presidential stint, and his megalomaniacal unsuitability for public service is catching up with him. Off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey have given Dems new reason to believe. Congressional Republicans are heading for the exits in telling numbers, while the possibility of a weak GOP candidate in Texas for U.S. Senate looms. This go-round, there’s no real chance of the suite of downballot flips that occurred eight years ago, when that decade’s electoral maps had overripened; still, it’s time now to take out your color wheel and start studying the liminal shades of what constitutes “blue,” plus your lidar scanner (what do you mean you don’t have one?) to start distinguishing calm waters, ripples, and waves.

Paying casual attention, you might not feel Texas Democrats are fielding the A-team that this moment calls for. By this time in that long-lost cycle when Senator Ted Cruz was so nearly ousted, El Paso Congressman Beto O’Rourke had already been running without real primary competition for the better part of a year. In contrast, this year’s marquee Dem nomination process has been slow and fitful. That fact, however, belies the comparative strength of the slate that’s likely to solidify in the coming months.

At least on paper, the 2026 Democratic nominees for the top four races (senator, governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general) are almost sure to be the most formidable class in recent memory. In 2018, only two of the four already held elected office, one at the county level. From 2020 through 2024, the only top-level nominee who did so was Colin Allred in ’24, then a congressman dragging a low-energy campaign against Cruz to a 9-point defeat. In lieu of seasoned politicians, Texans during these years were invited to put their faith in: a mild-mannered accountant, a self-assessed “ass-kicking, motorcycle-riding, tattooed Democrat,” a burned-out presidential hopeful, and a mild-mannered accountant yet again, among a couple others.

This November, Democrats may well put sitting legislators on the ballot in all four of the top slots. By this simple but meaningful metric, the slate should be stronger even than 2014’s relatively heralded lineup (which featured two state senators, Wendy Davis and Leticia Van de Putte, and a guy named Sam Houston). Of course, that ’14 team ended in ashes and grief; holding elected office is no guarantee against getting walloped. But it’s encouraging to see people who’ve won something before, and have something to lose, taking the plunge.

All that praise given, the process has still left plenty to be desired. Way back in May, Allred and O’Rourke met with Congressman Joaquin Castro and state Representative James Talarico to sort out who should take on incumbent U.S. Senator John Cornyn (or one of his primary challengers—Dems are hoping for the scandal-scarred Attorney General Ken Paxton) and to possibly divide their firepower among the races. This boys’ club managed to settle on approximately nothing. Allred jumped in the Senate race first, then Talarico did too; O’Rourke stayed out altogether, as did Castro, who months later gave a head-scratching series of comments about how he would have run for AG if only the other men could have sorted themselves out.

Poor coordination could lead to some odd outcomes. It’s possible that three of the four top nominees will be Austin state reps, a stark homogeneity that no one would intentionally plan. It’s also possible the slots will be split equally between Austin and Dallas politicians—still odd in a sprawling state whose largest city is neither of those two. And it’s further possible that three of the four will be Anglo, in a majority-nonwhite state headed toward majority-Latino status.

Then there’s the down-to-the-wire-ness of it all. North Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, in particular, waited until the afternoon of the final possible day to officially declare for the Senate, a looming decision that sent Allred scurrying instead into a competitive U.S. House primary that very morning. A firebrand who can earn all the media she needs and stack up cash, Crockett as a candidate means a zero-sum showdown with Talarico, who’d spent months receiving a rising-star treatment and building a lead over Allred.

To this point, I’ve written this column with an assumption that primary voters will tend toward sitting elected officials in March (and May, as needed) and with some indifference to Dem primary beefing in a state where the general election belongs to Republicans until proven otherwise. But voters will indeed have to make choices at the polls before any 2026 slate actually forms, so I’ll offer at least a few notes.

Talarico is a Democrat, a politician, and a Christian. This is a normal combination, though national media has treated it as exotic. The distinction is that, as a graduate student of liberal Presbyterianism, Talarico’s breadth and consistency of religious reference is greater than usual. And his serene delivery and boyish clean-cut looks are, as the kids would perhaps still say, giving pastor.

But Talarico’s campaign refrain that it’s “time to start flipping tables” begs a question: Can you picture him actually flipping a table? With Crockett, you can—or at least the verbal equivalent. With O’Rourke, the closest thing to a success story Texas Dems have, tables were in constant physical danger as the six-foot-something El Pasoan was wont to leap atop them before addressing a crowd. Both Crockett and O’Rourke are the type of politician who can say “fuck” and make it sound right.

Talarico has developed an effective religious-political rhetorical mode, but Crockett (again like O’Rourke) can go viral by breaking out of the politician mode entirely.

Before Crockett’s entrance, Talarico was in the catbird seat. He could be the left candidate and the center candidate at will, the head and the heart of the party alike. Now, even as he responds to his competitor with grace, the high road is obstructed. The lanes of progressive vs. moderate can’t be entirely avoided, and claims about electability and divisiveness will be inflected with race and gender.

Talarico has a large following on TikTok and Instagram; Crockett’s is larger. Talarico can raise money, and so can she. She holds a higher elected office, and she comes from a much more populous metro area. So why not her? Talarico doesn’t want to answer that, but the question isn’t going away.

A step down the ballot, five-term Austin state Representative Gina Hinojosa has nobly given up her seat to challenge the governor, who is likely untouchable but deserves a serious critic of his cronyism and creeping authoritarianism. In the absence of any serious South Texas candidate, Hinojosa will have to play the part—something she can credibly do as a Brownsville native with a last name that screams Valley to anyone who knows the region.

Rounding out the electeds running for the next two rungs, a third Austin state House member, Vikki Goodwin, is taking a shot at the lieutenant governor, and Dallas state Senator Nathan Johnson is aiming for the AG seat vacated by Paxton.

Apart from these, there’s a competing slate of already-rans (until the former congressman from Dallas switched races, I was going to call these Allred-y-rans—alas!). This includes Andrew White, an ex-governor’s son, himself running for guv for the second time [Update: White dropped his bid on January 5, after this story published in print]; long-ago-congressman and once-gubernatorial nominee Chris Bell also running for the executive mansion again; and ex-Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski taking a second stab at AG. (Mike Collier, the mild-mannered accountant himself, is also making his third lite guv bid—but this time as an Independent.) For these hopefuls, perhaps the umpteenth time will prove the charm, but voters are certainly under no pressure to bet on them now.

Comparative analyses of WACC consistently show that higher risk premiums in the Global South raise project-level costs of capital, reducing the number of investments that are financially viable.
Key factors include less stable and credit-worthy governments, currency volatility, limited access to instruments that enhance project credit-worthiness such as investment guarantees, and underdeveloped local capital markets.","Clean energy technologies have become more affordable around the world. Yet for many countries in the Global South, the cost of transitioning to a low-carbon economy remains disproportionately high. But not because the equipment is more expensive: in fact, solar and wind components are often imported at comparable prices around the world, as global manufacturing scale and trade have helped standardize hardware costs. Instead, the disparities in financing costs reflect the way the global financial system fails to adequately capture, differentiate and price risk.

In many emerging markets and developing economies, the cost of capital for renewable energy projects can be two to three times higher than in advanced economies. This gap is commonly observed through differences in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which reflects the risk-adjusted return that a project must offer to both lenders and investors. WACC captures how underlying risk perceptions in a given market are translated into financing costs, determining whether clean energy projects meet investors’ required returns. Comparative analyses of WACC consistently show that higher risk premiums in the Global South raise project-level costs of capital, reducing the number of investments that are financially viable. The result is slower deployment of clean energy and compounding constraints for adaptation investment, alongside greater fiscal pressure on public budgets that are already constrained.

A recent investigation highlights the case of India, where renewable energy developers report interest rates exceeding 12%—two to three times higher than typical rates in Europe or North America. This cost differential is not unique. Across emerging and developing economies, WACC estimates for utility-scale renewables frequently range from 10–15%, compared with 4–6% in advanced markets. These disparities are driven by a combination of structural constraints and risk perceptions that lead investors to price projects in emerging markets and developing economies as inherently riskier. Key factors include less stable and credit-worthy governments, currency volatility, limited access to instruments that enhance project credit-worthiness such as investment guarantees, and underdeveloped local capital markets. Together, these conditions embed higher risk premiums into financing costs, often linked to sovereign credit ratings and macro-financial indicators rather than to project fundamentals. The result is a structural pattern in which the financial architecture amplifies the cost of capital in markets that can least afford it, thereby constraining the energy transition where it is most urgent.

Part of the challenge lies in how risk is defined, which often pays insufficient attention to how different types of risk can be disaggregated and addressed independently. Current financial models tend to conflate sovereign risk with project-level or sectoral risk, applying blanket premiums across entire countries or regions regardless of actual investment conditions. A well-structured renewable energy project backed by long-term offtake agreements—in which a buyer commits ahead of time to purchasing a large portion of the project’s energy output—may still be priced as high risk simply because it is located in a low-rated jurisdiction. This conflation distorts the risk-return calculus and creates a disincentive to invest, even when the fundamentals are strong.

There is growing confusion, and frustration, among both public and private actors about what “risk” actually refers to in this context: macroeconomic volatility? Foreign exchange mismatches? Regulatory uncertainty? Credit-worthiness of the utility? Without clear, transparent methodologies, risk assessments become proxies for familiarity and precedent, reinforcing a cycle where capital flows to countries already deemed investable, rather than those with the greatest need or opportunity.

The current system is not equipped to assess risk in a way that is granular, forward-looking or developmentally aligned. In the absence of consistent standards and improved data, perceptions of risk continue to be shaped more by structural bias than by measurable factors. As a result, capital is misallocated, not because of the intrinsic riskiness of projects in the Global South, but because of how poorly the system captures and differentiates risk in the first place.

At the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, which is part of the Columbia Climate School, ongoing research points to several areas where targeted reforms could improve the accessibility and affordability of climate finance in emerging markets.

One important lever for lowering the cost of capital is the design of blended finance instruments, which use public and philanthropic capital to attract additional private investment by improving the risk-return profile of investments. In principle, these instruments are meant to use scarce public or concessional resources to absorb specific risks that private investors are unwilling or unable to bear, thereby mobilizing additional private capital rather than replacing it.

In practice, however, many blended finance structures remain overly conservative. Concessional capital—capital provided at below-market terms or with a higher tolerance for risk—is often allocated to relatively low-risk portions of a project’s capital structure, where it has limited impact on investor behavior. Instruments such as guarantees, which protect lenders or investors against defined losses (for example, in the event of default or revenue shortfalls), or junior tranches, which absorb first losses before senior investors are affected, are frequently underused or applied too narrowly. Similarly, currency buffers or hedging mechanisms, designed to protect projects from exchange-rate volatility, remain scarce or expensive in many developing markets. Redirecting concessional resources toward these types of risk-absorbing functions could better align risk-sharing with where capital constraints are most binding, and more effectively lower the cost of capital in high-risk contexts.

Another area is multilateral development bank (MDB) reform. Recent independent reviews have suggested that MDBs could significantly increase their lending capacity without jeopardizing credit ratings by deploying more of their balance sheets toward risk mitigation. Several institutions are beginning to act on these recommendations, but implementation remains uneven.

Foreign exchange risk is another persistent barrier. Currency mismatches between projects that borrow money in global currencies such as U.S. dollars, yet earn revenues in a local currency, pose risks to investors since the exchange rate between those currencies may fluctuate during the project. Solutions such as the Currency Exchange Fund offer one model, but broader efforts are needed to scale financial tools and facilities that allow investors to hedge against these risks.

There is also growing recognition that risk must be understood in relative, not absolute, terms. Some climate-vulnerable countries face greater near-term instability from underinvestment than from macroeconomic volatility. As such, treating them as uninvestable can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

While the volume of climate finance remains a central concern, it is increasingly clear that the issue is not lack of capital, but poorly allocated capital due to mispricing embedded in the system. In other words, the cost of capital is not a neutral input; it shapes which projects get built, which technologies scale, and which countries can realistically meet their climate goals.

Several ongoing initiatives are working to address these issues. The Bridgetown Initiative has called for new liquidity mechanisms and debt instruments for vulnerable states. The Inter-American Development Bank’s updated approach to blended finance seeks to increase mobilization and improve structuring. And global discussions on MDB reform continue to gain traction, including through the G20 and the COP finance tracks.

Yet much heavy lifting remains. Achieving a just energy transition will require confronting the systemic factors that continue to price sustainability out of reach for many. As clean energy technologies become cheaper and more widely available, the real barrier is no longer technical; it’s financial. And that is a barrier we have the tools to overcome.

Municipal bonds are a time-honored way to fund roads, schools, bridges and other public projects while paying investors interest, usually at tax-free rates.

But what happens when floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other climate events buckle roads, swamp public buildings and disrupt the municipal revenues that pay for the bond debt?

They can create what researchers from Northeastern University call a climate debt doom loop that makes it even harder for cities and towns to respond to and prepare for future disasters.

In a paper published in Nature Cities, a new journal from the prestigious science publication Nature focusing on resilient, greener environments, professor Auroop Ganguly and Ph.D. graduate student Aayushi Mishra worked with finance experts to describe how climate risk creates challenges as well as opportunities for municipalities to protect their infrastructure and their tax base.

“If more and more bridges and roads get affected by climate disasters, the financing aspect becomes a greater challenge,” said Mishra, who is working on her doctorate in interdisciplinary engineering. “This is especially the case for under-resourced communities, cities that don’t have a great tax base to rely on.”

But there are ways to disrupt the doom loop, she said.

The climate debt doom loop

Municipal bonds are debt securities issued by states, counties, cities and towns to cover costs such as capital projects, including the construction of schools, highways, water systems and sewers, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Municipalities and states rely on their revenue base to repay investors when the bonds come due. For generations, investments in the bonds, which currently finance more than 70% of the country’s public projects, have been considered low risk.

Climate events, both sudden and slow-moving, are exposing vulnerabilities within the public finance system, Mishra said. Underpricing bonds means there are not enough funds to address catastrophic storms, fires and rising waters.

The result is the “vicious cycle” known as the climate debt doom loop, according to the Nature Cities article. “Growing physical losses impact municipal public health, which limits adaptation efforts, thereby raising future climate exposure risks and subsequently increasing borrowing costs,” the research found.

The costs are high, the researchers said. In 2023 alone, the U.S. experienced 28 separate billion-dollar disasters.

Holes in the safety net

The job of dealing with climate blows to infrastructure is increasingly falling on cities, states and towns as the federal government withdraws support for such agencies as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Mishra and Ganguly said.

In the first week of the new year, CNN reported that the Trump administration is cutting dozens of frontline staff at FEMA.

At the same time, insurance companies are withdrawing from high-risk states such as Florida, Louisiana and California, Mishra said.

“The safety nets are getting eroded and the responsibility of not just recovery but resilience itself is falling onto states and municipalities,” she said.

Mishra said that creates an opportunity for market growth.

Disrupting the loop

Taking advantage of the low-cost, low-financing aspects of municipal bonds can help cities prevent their subways from flooding and protect waterfronts important for tourism, said Tom Doe, founder and chairperson of the board of Municipal Markets Analytics Inc. He collaborated with Northeastern researchers and others on the Nature Cities article.

“Attention needs to be drawn to the tax revenue streams that are in harm’s way,” he said.

Doe said he predicts that the $500 billion in municipal bonds issued annually will increase to a trillion in the 2030s “largely because of projects related to climate resilience and adaptation.”

Innovative approaches taken by cities and towns include an investment by Cincinnati in stormwater management and affordable housing due to anticipated in-migration as a climate safe haven.

Residents of Virginia Beach, Virginia, passed a multi-million-dollar bond referendum to finance flood defense infrastructure, Mishra said. And Miami voters passed a Miami Forever general obligation bond to address sea-level rise and promote affordable housing, among other things.

Ganguly, Northeastern distinguished professor of civil and environmental engineering, said in the Nature Cities article that Mishra built a bridge between academic theory, private sector expertise and public sector practice.

“She has been influencing or starting to influence best practices,” he said.

“The key takeaway is that this market is something that a lot of cities rely on for infrastructure financing,” Mishra said, adding that climate risk needs to be part of the conversation.

The Nature Cities paper is not about policy innovations that may be a hard sell to voters, Mishra said. “This is a paper that talks about things that are already here that we can employ.”",https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hurricane_disaster1400.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 14:59:41.358142

Zeldin specifically targeted rules aimed at encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, cutting emissions from power plants and safeguarding waterways from harmful pollution. The EPA is also seeking to decrease the amount of federally protected wetlands and rolling back Biden-era regulations on chemicals.

That day, the agency launched an ambitious legal strategy to make those deregulatory policies stick. By undoing so many rules as quickly as possible, the EPA aims to rapidly provoke lawsuits that can then work their way through a court system more favorable than ever to Trump. A final judgment in the administration’s favor would help cement the policies, making them harder for a future Democratic president to reverse.

“We are working hard to develop policies and adhere to the best reading of the law in a way that will make these rules durable,” EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch said in a statement. “The American people deserve certainty and predictability from the EPA that will last longer than a few years at a time.”

Conservatives and environmental groups agree that Zeldin’s decision to pursue a shock and awe strategy of announcing so many actions less than two months into the new administration resulted from lessons learned from the first Trump administration’s approach to deregulation.

When President Donald Trump was first elected, his administration was slow to start rewriting regulations, said Kenny Stein, vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, a libertarian think tank.

That meant lawsuits challenging those changes were still being argued in court when President Joe Biden took office and directed the Justice Department to stop defending Trump policies, settle cases or remand the policies back to the agencies for revision, Stein said.

This time around, the Trump administration has taken a different approach.

“Zeldin has kind of taken a lesson there and is basically just saying, ‘We know what we want to do, let’s do it,’” Stein said. “Zeldin is a lawyer himself, maybe that’s why he’s thinking like this: Let’s get to the courthouse now.”

Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, agreed the EPA under Zeldin is “really trying to move fast and break things.”

The EPA has been quick to announce proposed rules and initiate public comment periods, which are required by law before a rule can be finalized. In June, the agency issued its draft proposal to eliminate Biden-era restrictions on power plants’ emissions of greenhouse gases, mercury and other toxic chemicals. In July, it proposed rescinding the endangerment finding, the legal opinion underpinning most of the agency’s climate policies, while also throwing out limits on greenhouse gas emissions from cars. In September, it announced plans to cancel a rule requiring companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions.

So far, most of the rollbacks remain in the early stages, making it difficult to say whether Zeldin’s strategy is working, said Abigail Dillen, the president of environmental law firm Earthjustice.

“They’ve projected that they’re going to do a lot of this stuff. They’re not getting to the point of finalizing or even taking final action that’s actually in the courts yet,” Dillen said.

Under Republican leadership today, Congress serves no purpose other than to pop up as Trump’s cheering squad.","As a journalist in California, I spent a lot of time traveling to and reporting on the role of the U.S. in Latin America. It’s not a pretty picture. In Cuba, Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile, Argentina and other countries, there is a history of pure imperialism — propping up dictators, attempted assassinations, destroying local economies, and invading and occupying other countries — documented by historian Walter LaFeber in his classic work, “Inevitable Revolutions.”

If you thought those days were over, you were wrong.

We can now add one more chapter: Venezuela. There are so many things wrong with President Trump’s takeover of Venezuela and seizure of Nicolas Maduro that it’s hard to know where to start.

In no particular order of importance, it is a flagrant violation of international law, including treaties which the U.S. has ratified. Venezuela is not a national security threat to the U.S. Venezuela has never attacked any American citizens or property. Venezuela is responsible for only a tiny sliver of illegal drugs coming into the U.S. There’s no way Trump can justify blowing up small boats off the coast of Venezuela, seizing its oil tankers, or kidnapping its leader — admittedly an illegally elected leader — as a matter of self-defense.

Trump’s war against Venezuela is also a repudiation of his campaign promises to focus on “America First” and avoid “endless foreign wars,” and “regime change” in particular. Promises made, promises broken. As with Vietnam, Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq, here we go with another ill-fated U.S. attempt at regime change — this one all Trump’s.

And it may not end there. Flying back to Washington on Sunday, Trump told reporters he is also considering intervening in five other countries. That should prompt some Trump supporters, and maybe even Republican members of Congress, to pipe up: “This is not what we voted for.”

This is also an invitation to other world leaders to follow Trump’s example of asserting absolute power within his country’s “sphere of influence.” Russian President Vladimir Putin will certainly claim that Trump’s takeover of Venezuela validates his own attempts to seize Ukraine. One can easily imagine Chinese President Xi Jinping looking at news from Venezuela and concluding, “If Trump can get away with that, why can’t I? April looks like a good time to seize Taiwan.”

Trump’s war against Venezuela is just the latest manifestation of his abuse of presidential power. In the last 11 months, he has flouted domestic law by firing tens of thousands of federal employees without cause, firing 17 inspectors general, firing the head of the Office of Special Counsel and the director of the Office of Government Ethics, directing the Justice Department to prosecute his political opponents and tearing down the East Wing of the White House.

Now he is defying international law by violating the United Nations Charter, ratified by the U.S., which prohibits any country from using military force against another country without either its consent, a self-defense rationale or the authorization of the U.N. Security Council. Trump also violated the War Powers Act of 1973, which limits a president’s ability to send troops into armed conflict without congressional approval. Like the rest of us, members of Congress only learned about the invasion of Venezuela and Maduro’s seizure after it happened.

So what’s Congress going to do about it? Absolutely nothing, of course! And that’s the most disturbing news of all.

Rather than condemn Trump’s refusal to consult Congress before going to war, as required by the Constitution and the War Powers Act, Republican leaders of Congress have again simply rolled over. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) both hailed the Venezuela operation as “decisive.”

It makes you wonder if we even need a Congress anymore.

One by one, Congress has been abdicating its constitutional powers to the president. It long ago abandoned its unique power to declare war. Last year, it surrendered its sole authority to levy tariffs and its constitutional power of the purse. Now it is happy to sit on the sidelines while Trump illegally takes over another country and seizes its oil.

On Dec. 8, in an op-ed for the New York Times, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) asked: “What’s the Point of Congress?” Good question. Under Republican leadership today, Congress serves no purpose other than to pop up as Trump’s cheering squad. Who needs Congress? Better to shut it down.

The firm advised Vistra Corp. on the USD 4 billion deal.

International law firm King & Spalding announced yesterday (5 January) its role in advising Texas-based retail electricity and power generation company Vistra Corp. on its acquisition of Cogentrix Energy, an independent power producer headquartered in North Carolina.

The King & Spalding team advising Vistra includes New York M&A and private equity partner Enrico Granata and partner David Runnels, counsel Emma Jiang, senior associate Andrew Ketner and associate Matthew Kraemer of the firm’s Houston-based corporate, finance and investments practice.

Vistra has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Cogentrix Energy, which comprises 10 modern natural gas generation facilities with 5,500 MW of combined capacity. The USD 4 billion deal (net purchase price) also includes seven combined cycle gas turbine facilities, two combustion turbine facilities and one cogeneration facility. The transaction, expected to close in mid-to-late 2026, is subject to regulatory approvals from the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as state regulatory approvals.

“The Vistra team is excited to announce the acquisition of the Cogentrix portfolio, marking the second opportunistic expansion of our generation footprint over the past year to support our ability to serve growing customer demand in our key markets,"" commented Vistra president and CEO Jim Burke. “Successfully integrating and operating generation assets is a major undertaking, and our talented team continues to demonstrate that it is a core competency of our company.”

Cogentrix Energy is indirectly owned by funds managed by Quantum Capital Group.

Quantum founder and CEO Wil VanLoh said: “We are pleased to have reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the Cogentrix portfolio to Vistra.

EPN Urges Trump EPA to Halt Proposed WOTUS Rule That Weakens Protections, Ignores Science and Puts Public Health at Risk

Washington, D.C. — This week, the Environmental Protection Network (EPN) submitted comments opposing the Trump Administration’s proposed definition of “Waters of the United States,” which was established to protect America’s rivers and streams and, ultimately, the well-being of communities. EPN urges the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to abandon this damaging proposal and instead rely on the 2023 Conforming Rule, which already addresses the Sackett decision. EPN is also calling on EPA and USACE to work proactively with states and Tribes to fill the gaps in water resource protection created by Sackett.

“This rule defies the Clean Water Act and well-established science, putting the health and welfare of the American people at risk,” said Peter Murchie, EPN Senior Director for Policy and a former EPA Puget Sound National Program Office Branch Manager. “Finalizing it would roll back decades of progress, remove protections from most wetlands and millions of miles of streams, and increase pollution, flooding, and costs nationwide. EPA exists to protect our water, not make it easier for polluters to harm natural resources we depend on.”

“The decades of research and billions of dollars spent monitoring and protecting water quality in this country will be reversed if this rule is finalized as proposed,” EPN wrote in their comments. “This rule will result in the loss of CWA protections for most of the wetlands in the country and millions of miles of streams. This in turn will dramatically increase pollution raising the costs of wastewater and drinking water treatment for communities, increase flooding exacerbating property damages, and destroy habitat eliminating hunting and fishing uses.”

Key Takeaways From EPN’s Comments

EPN warns the proposed rule would gut what remains of Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction, resulting in a minimal scope that will prevent achievement of the act’s goal to protect the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters.

EPN urges the agencies to abandon this damaging proposed rule, rely on the 2023 Conforming Rule (called the Amended 2023 Rule in the proposal), and work proactively with states and Tribes to fill the gaps in water protection created by Sackett.

The proposed “bright line” definitions of relatively permanent flow and continuous surface connection rely heavily on the ambiguous concept of a “wet season,” are scientifically indefensible, and will invite endless litigation over case-specific jurisdictional determinations. Decades of research and field experience show that multiple lines of evidence are necessary to determine whether a stream or wetland must be protected under the Clean Water Act, consistent with the Sackett decision.

EPA and the Army Corps lack a sufficient basis to claim that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and EPN believes they have not conducted a meaningful assessment of small business impacts under the RFA.

EPN finds that the RIA analysis focuses so heavily on cost savings from reduced permitting and regulatory requirements that it fails to adequately account for the direct and indirect environmental costs, as well as the shift in responsibility and costs to states and Tribes that may take on the program to protect their resources.

EPN believes the agencies must consider the impacts of activities in jurisdictional waters, because jurisdictional status is key to restoring and maintaining the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters by ensuring regulatory review.

At a hearing in December, Dr. Betsy Southerland, an EPN volunteer and the former Director of Science & Technology in EPA’s Office of Water warned that the proposed rule ignores the real-world consequences: more flooding, more toxic runoff, higher water bills, and the loss of places families fish, swim and enjoy everyday.

Prior to today’s comments, EPN submitted comments requesting a 15-day extension to the WOTUS rule’s 45-day comment period, citing timing constraints and the proposal’s significant impacts on Clean Water Act protections and public review needs. Despite the comprehensive time needed for review, EPA did not grant the additional time necessary for communities to weigh in. Nonetheless, EPN worked closely with its volunteer experts to ensure thorough, science-based comments were submitted within the limited timeframe.

(Scientists have accounted for those natural processes in determining, by overwhelming consensus, that human activities are the primary and largest driver of climate change.)
Trump 2.0’s attack on climate change information has received a lot of media coverage in the last year—and for good reason.
The agency is only continuing this trend with its most recent webpage takedown of anthropogenic causes of climate change.
Like climate change, the Trump administration’s efforts to remove climate data from government websites feels vast, intangible, and overwhelming.","In 1969, a year before the Environmental Protection Agency was born, one of President Nixon’s aides sent out an alarming memo about a novel existential threat to the administration. Was it the Soviet Union? Nuclear weapons? Nope. It was the “carbon dioxide problem.” That aide, Daniel Moynihan, was explicit about the impact humans were having on a warming planet. “[M]an has begun to introduce instability through the burning of fossil fuels,” he wrote. In Moynihan’s own words, the stakes of projected planetary warming and sea-level rise were apocalyptic: “Goodbye New York. Goodbye Washington, for that matter.”

It’s hard to believe that almost 60 years later, today’s EPA—the federal agency responsible for protecting environmental and human health—has wiped away the connection between humans and climate change from its website.

In early December, the EPA surreptitiously removed at least 80 webpages related to the causes, indicators, and impacts of climate change, by far the most extensive removal of climate change information from the agency’s website yet during Trump’s second administration. One of the most alarming changes was the deletion of any mention of anthropogenic climate change (warming specifically caused by humans) from its Causes of Climate Change webpage.

“The decision to omit human-induced climate change from the federal agenda represents a significant shift in the long-standing connection between science and policy,” said Lindsay Anderson, a professor in environmental engineering and interim director for the Cornell Energy Systems Institute. “The influence of human activity on recent climate patterns is supported by decades of scientific study.”

Forget fossil fuel consumption, agriculture, road construction, deforestation, and aerosols—all human-led greenhouse gas activities that contribute to the Earth’s warming climate. Now, according to the EPA, planetary warming can be attributed to “natural processes” like changes in the Earth’s orbit and rotation, solar activity, planetary reflexivity, and volcanic activity. (Scientists have accounted for those natural processes in determining, by overwhelming consensus, that human activities are the primary and largest driver of climate change.) Other pages that went dark during the agency’s latest scrub included the EPA’s flagship Climate Change Risk Analysis (CIRA) project and Framework for Evaluated Damages and Impacts page.

In the last year, the administration has systematically overhauled the government’s information landscape across federal agencies: taking down full webpages, erasing specific words like “climate change” and language related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, inconspicuously excising sentences and paragraphs it disagreed with, removing whole datasets without a trace, and rerouting URLs or making them defunct altogether. The scale of the data takedown is almost inconceivable.

Some of the biggest losses have been deletions of climate and environmental justice resources like the Council on Environmental Quality’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), which went down in the days immediately following President Trump’s inauguration. And this summer, to the horror of scientists, researchers, and environmentalists, all five National Climate Assessments, along with the US Global Change Research Program and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s climate.gov webpages, went dark.

To many, the scale of the EPA’s recent webpage deletions is as important as these other, earlier data losses. “This type of change feels more insidious,” said Izzy Pacenza, project coordinator at the data rescue organization Environmental Data & Governance Initiative. Pacenza feels as though this most recent information loss is one of the most calculated to date. “We’re seeing the wholesale removal of entire websites and webpages. Now, we’re [also] seeing specific sentences and paragraphs that discuss anthropogenic causes of climate change removed.”

The new information removals are chaotic and inconsistent. For example, the EPA’s Future of Climate Change page—which states that “human activities have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which has changed the earth’s climate”—contradictorily remains untouched at the time of this publication.

Trump 2.0’s attack on climate change information has received a lot of media coverage in the last year—and for good reason. According to an Environmental Data & Governance Initiative report last summer, the scope and speed of website changes under Trump 2.0 far outpaces those of the first Trump administration. “The way that information has been removed,” Pacenza said of Trump’s second term, “it’s not this sweeping attack. It feels much more deliberate.”

Scientists, researchers, historians, scholars, and activists have been sounding the alarm since last January that the administration is obfuscating information and distorting facts. For them, data removal affects the monitoring and assessment of a variety of scientific and societal trends, including income inequality, racial disparities, access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. In short, data disappearance makes it harder to make evidence-based arguments for policy change. Even industry, from insurers to oil and gas firms, have worried that the administration has gone too far in decimating access to credible federal data.

But how does disappearing data affect the everyday person?

The public relies on accurate US data to make informed choices that impact their livelihood and wellbeing. From an environmental viewpoint, credible local, state, and federal data can show whether a home is in a floodplain, if a community is at risk for “forever chemicals” in its drinking water or for bad air quality, what to do in cases of extreme heat or drought, or how to prepare for dangerous weather events like Category 5 Hurricanes. The list is extensive—and it’s nonpartisan.

Distorted federal data also makes it harder to know what information to trust. Around the time that the Trump administration took down the site that had housed the National Climate Assessments, the Department of Energy published its own report questioning the very basics of climate science. The authors of this dubious report—which have since been called out by mainstream scientists for cherry-picking information and circumventing scientific review processes—have now been tapped to write the next National Climate Assessment. Prior assessments have historically had real impact on the American public. Many constituents, from farmers to small business owners, use them to prepare for the impact of heatwaves, droughts, and floods, and local governments use them to design infrastructure projects and neighborhood public health plans. Inaccurate or incomplete information will ultimately leave communities vulnerable to and unprepared for the climate threats that await them. And the administration’s piecemeal approach to removing, excising, and changing other crucial data leads to a general lack of trust in the information provided by all federal agencies.

It’s a playbook that has been used by other authoritarian regimes. Hungary and Turkey have taken similar steps to erase and distort information, exploiting state-run websites to control national narratives and shape what the public consumes. Perhaps most crucially, the distortion and disappearance of authoritative data make it difficult for the public to hold the government and its institutions to account.

Take the EPA’s July proposal to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding, the scientific and legal foundation allowing the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its proposed rule to rescind the declaration, the EPA was legally required to hold a comment period during which anyone could submit direct feedback on the proposal. Such comment periods are one of the main ways—other than the voting booth—that the public can communicate with the government on important and impactful issues.

But credible data that could have helped the public make an informed decision on this particular proposal has been made sparse: all five National Climate Assessments had previously been removed, and the EPA by that point had made almost a thousand changes to the agency’s webpages. By restricting access to factual agency information—like resources about greenhouse gases and their connections to human health—the EPA actively suppressed the very information needed to engage in the regulatory process. The agency is only continuing this trend with its most recent webpage takedown of anthropogenic causes of climate change.

Like climate change, the Trump administration’s efforts to remove climate data from government websites feels vast, intangible, and overwhelming. It’s hard to pinpoint one specific issue or circumstance and call it out for what it is. Data rescue coalitions have saved enormous amounts of data and shed light on the meticulous and calculated lengths the administration has gone through to obfuscate the facts. But they cannot rescue all the disappeared data. And whether the government says so or not, the planet is changing. Temperatures are going up, seas are rising, and storms are getting more extreme. By hiding data about these changes, the Trump administration is attempting to keep citizens in the dark. It’s time to shed a light on the administration’s climate change disinformation project, and to keep it there long enough that citizens can act accordingly.",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/40984626834_9d968fecc1_k.jpg.webp,N,,2026-01-06 14:59:28.328862

The U.S. climate transition has hit a roadblock. Its climate ambition of achieving 50% Electric Vehicle (EV) market penetration by 2030 mandates a 24% annual growth in EV sales. However, the U.S. EV market has experienced slow growth for over 20 consecutive months (Fig. 1)1. Similar trend is observed in many other countries. France, Germany, and Italy saw stagnation or even decline in EV adoption since Q3 2023, far below the 27% annual growth needed to meet net-zero emission targets2. In contrast, EV adoption is accelerating on the other side of the globe. China’s EV penetration rate has exceeded 50% since July 2024. Australia, with a similar EV penetration level to the U.S., experiences 44% growth in EV sales from Q3 2023 to Q2 2025.

The slowdown in the U.S. stems from multiple factors, including range anxiety3, battery safety concerns4, infrastructure deficiencies5, high interest rate6, saturation of company car fleet7, etc. While many of these issues exist globally, China’s sustained growth demonstrates that offering highly affordable EVs could potentially help markets overcome these challenges and sustain organic market growth.

Chinese automakers currently offer some of the world’s most affordable EVs. China’s BYD Seal, a top-selling mid-size EV in Australia, is priced 22% below its American counterpart – Tesla Model 3. BYD’s advanced Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) model, the Qin L, offers 81-mpg fuel economy and a 2100-km range (80-km all-electric range)8, all for $13,800 – half the price of the U.S. PHEV sales leader, Toyota Prius. These advantages help explain the rapid EV adoption in China and countries welcoming Chinese EVs, such as Australia.

The U.S. is tightening market access for foreign EVs. Taking Chinese EVs as an example, in May 2024, the Biden administration imposed a 100% additional tariff on Chinese EV imports. Subsequently, the Trump administration raised this tariff substantially to 145%-245%, before negotiations reduced it to 135%. Similar tariff increases have appeared in U.S. trade with many other countries. It is, therefore, important to analyze the impact of the tariffs from a cost perspective.

EV Tariff Impact Assessment

In this study, we first analyze the potential effect of the increased tariffs from the consumer perspective, then argue that this move risks forfeiting a critical opportunity for the U.S. to enhance EV affordability, stimulate market growth, and hit climate targets. Finally, we discuss potential strategies to improve outcomes. Our assessment is based on a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) framework2,9, which measures the cost of purchasing and using a vehicle.

Given the uncertainty surrounding future tariff rates following potential negotiations and the already substantial effect of the 100% additional tariff, we use the scenario of Chinese EVs under the 100% additional tariff to illustrate the impacts. Considering the limited profit margin of Chinese automakers, full tariff pass-through is assumed in the baseline case, with varying pass-through rates tested in sensitivity analysis. Using mid-size cars – the largest segment in the U.S. market – as a representative example, we compare the TCO of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) with that of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), the major competitors to BEVs.

The results indicate that BEVs currently do not offer a significant TCO advantage against HEVs in the U.S. For most states, the TCO of HEVs and BEVs are close (Fig. 2a), and BEVs even cost $387-2582 higher than HEVs in more than 10 states. This partly explains the limited momentum to overcome the current EV market stagnation. A comparison across states without Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates further reveals that EV penetration rates are generally higher in states where BEVs provide clear TCO savings. For instance, in Arizona, Utah, and Illinois – where BEVs save $4679, $3178, and $2287 over HEVs in the lifetime, respectively – the EV penetration rates reached 9.4%, 8.7%, and 7.8% in 2024 (Fig. 2b).

If China-produced EVs were introduced into the U.S. market without additional tariffs, they could significantly enhance EV affordability in all 50 states (Fig. 2c). China-produced BEVs could save $10,000-20,000 over their lifecycle compared with HEVs, substantially more than U.S.-made BEVs ($12,500-15,000 more saved). This price advantage could potentially trigger a surge in EV adoption in the U.S., akin to the situation seen in Australia. Even with higher electricity prices and potential battery replacements, Chinese EVs would still save $6000-16,000 compared with HEVs. Such affordability-improvement benefits can be mirrored across all other segments (Fig. 2d), particularly in small and compact vehicle segments. These segments accounted for over 37.8% of the U.S. auto market, yet exhibited EV penetration rates of only 4.5%, far below the fleet average of 11.6%. Limited model availability and high prices have been key barriers. More affordable options could unlock substantial market growth in these segments.

However, China-produced EVs no longer offer affordability benefits under high U.S. tariffs. (Fig. 2e). Using representative mid-size car models as an example (Fig. 2f), the TCO of BYD Seal would have been 19% and 20% lower than that of Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Camry Hybrid. With the tariff, these numbers reverse, making the BYD Seal 19% and 17% more costly. Assuming lower tariff pass-through rates of 50% and 75%, the TCO of mid-size Chinese EVs would be only 2% lower and 7.8% higher than that of HEVs (Fig. 3a). Under alternative assumptions for energy prices, maintenance costs, and battery degradation, additional tariffs would raise the TCO of Chinese EVs to 16%-21% higher than that of HEVs (Fig. 3b).

This situation is not unique. EVs from Japan, Korea, and the EU also face tariffs exceeding 25%, further reducing the affordability of EV products in the U.S. This means that the U.S. has to rely on the affordability of domestically produced EVs to incentivize consumer purchases, whereas EV sales suggest this strategy has not been successful. Moreover, the up-to-$7500 tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which primarily benefit U.S.-made EVs, are set to expire in September 2025. This could further erode the EV affordability, creating additional barriers to EV market growth in the U.S.

A Win-Win Solution

While consumers experience welfare losses from tariffs, several stakeholders stand to benefit. The automotive industry provides 9.7 million jobs in the U.S10., accounting for 2.8% of the total employment. In swing states like Michigan, 20% of the workforce is employed in the auto sector11. Imposing EV tariffs could safeguard domestic manufacturing and employment, enable U.S. automakers retain substantial market shares, strengthen political support in key states, and increase government revenues.

However, these gains come at the expense of the low-carbon transition and long-term industrial competitiveness. Elevated tariffs hinder access to affordable EV imports, slowing progress toward decarbonization. Reduced market competition may also weaken incentives for innovation and efficiency improvements among U.S. automakers. The U.S. exported 2.5 million cars in 202312. More than half of the production from U.S. automakers were sold in overseas markets, where they face direct competition without tariff protection. Additionally, U.S.-based suppliers, such as Goodyear, Lear, and Qualcomm, produce parts for automakers in China, Japan, and the EU. Tariff escalation risks retaliation and complicates their international operations.

Localizing foreign production capacities, e.g., Chinese EV supply chains, in the U.S. offers a more balanced strategy. First, it helps preserve the affordability of Chinese EVs even with U.S.-based production, thereby supporting vehicle electrification. BYD’s electric bus plant in Lancaster, California, the world’s largest electric bus manufacturing facility, exemplifies this. Electric buses produced there, with 70% U.S. content by value13, cost 10%-30% less than U.S.-made alternatives14. Second, localized production generates social and economic benefits for local communities. BYD’s Lancaster plant has contributed to a 25% increase in the city’s annual revenue and a 35% growth in local employment, demonstrating the synergy of collaboration between Chinese firms and U.S. supply chains. Third, localizing Chinese EV supply chain can foster technological spillovers, talent development, and market competition, incentivizing U.S. automakers to innovate, improve EV affordability, and strengthen global competitiveness.

The global EV trade is facing rising barriers. The EU imposed 17%-38% tariffs on Chinese EV imports. Mexico has removed EV import tax exemptions for countries without free trade agreements. Canada and Turkey also imposed protectionist policies. In this context, we argue that, to meet EV penetration targets, partnering with Chinese companies to build local supply chains can be a feasible strategy for these countries. The affordability advantage of Chinese EVs can be largely maintained with localized manufacturing. For example, the cost of BYD Seal produced in Hungary would be 25% lower than its Tesla counterpart15. Moreover, this can be achieved without sacrificing those countries core interests.

The challenges facing China-produced EVs are not isolated incidents. Amid complex political, economic, and technology competition contexts, global manufacturing and supply chain are increasingly fragmented. Particularly, trade barriers to critical and strategic technologies such as batteries, photovoltaics, and semiconductors are all on the rise16. Many of these technologies are essential to low-carbon transition. We argue that international cooperation between foreign advanced production capacity and local supply chains should be strengthened to achieve the co-benefits in climate change mitigation, domestic social welfare, and industrial competitiveness.

TCO Calculation Model

The TCO approach is widely used and well established in techno-economic analyses17,18. It accounts for all costs incurred over the lifecycle of a technology and can be applied across a broad range of technologies. In this study, we developed a TCO model to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on consumers. The TCO of vehicles comprises of both purchasing cost and using cost, including depreciation cost, license and registration cost, insurance, maintenance and repair cost, and fuel cost (Eq. 1). The tariffs add the depreciation cost and is presented separately in this study. In the U.S., the tariffs include the basic tariff, the Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF), the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF), and the additional tariff, which is assumed to be 100% due to its already significant effect.

$${TCO}={C}_{{dep}}+{C}_{{reg}}+{C}_{{ins}}+{C}_{{rep}}+{C}_{{fuel}}+{C}_{{tar}}$$

(1)

where,\({TCO}\) is the total cost of ownership ($);\({C}_{{dep}}\) is the depreciation cost ($);\({C}_{{reg}}\) is the license and registration cost ($);\({C}_{{ins}}\) is the insurance ($);\({C}_{{rep}}\) is the maintenance and repair cost ($);\({C}_{{fuel}}\) is the fuel cost ($);\({C}_{{tar}}\) is the tariff-related cost, which is presented separately in this study ($).

The depreciation cost is calculated by multiplying the price and the depreciation rate that declines over time (Eq. 2). The license and registration cost varies by state and is derived from regulatory data across all 50 U.S. states. The insurance is the sum of a fixed base rate and a variable portion that also differs by state (Eq. 3). The maintenance and repair cost is obtained based on the average per-km rate and the total mileage traveled (Eq. 4). The fuel cost is calculated as the product of energy consumption and fuel price (Eq. 5). For PHEVs, energy consumption includes both electricity and gasoline, which are calculated based on the Utility Factor (UF)9. The energy price in each year is calculated using the escalation rates provided by the Argonne National Laboratory9.

$${C}_{{dep}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=1}^{{VL}}\frac{{P}_{0}\times ({R}_{R{S}_{t-1}}-{R}_{R{S}_{t}})}{{\left(1+{R}_{D}\right)}^{t}}$$

$${C}_{{in}{s}_{i}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=1}^{{VL}}\frac{{(P}_{0}\times {R}_{R{S}_{t-1}}\times {R}_{V{I}_{i}}+{C}_{F{I}_{i}})\times {R}_{{IF}{L}_{t}}}{{\left(1+{R}_{D}\right)}^{t}}$$

Key Assumptions and Considerations

In this study, we chose representative models for TCO calculation. All vehicle models are categorized into 10 segments based on the wheelbase, i.e., cars: mini, small, compact, mid-size, and large; SUV: mini, small, compact, mid-size, and large19. The representative models are the top sellers in each segment. Detailed specifications of these models, including the price, energy consumption rate, and the wheelbase, are provided in Supplementary Table S3. The TCO results are listed in Supplementary Table S4–S13. Abbreviations used in this paper, along with the full names, are listed in Supplementary S15 and S16.

The tariffs’ impacts are complex, involving multiple stakeholders and heterogeneous effects20. For consumers, tariffs lead to welfare losses, whereas certain industries may benefit from protectionist measures. Given the difficulty of directly comparing these diverse costs and benefits, we adopt TCO as the primary indicator to assess the outcomes of tariff policies. It is also related to broader welfare dimensions, such as low-carbon transition. A more comprehensive assessment framework would, however, require further in-depth analysis.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44168-025-00330-6/MediaObjects/44168_2025_330_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-06 13:00:40.629024

Vistra has inked an agreement to acquire Cogentrix Energy, taking ownership of its 5.5 GW portfolio of natural gas generation facilities for a net purchase price of around $4 billion, the company announced Monday.

The acquisition includes “three combined cycle gas turbine facilities and two combustion turbine facilities located across PJM, four combined cycle gas turbine facilities in ISO New England, and one cogeneration facility in ERCOT,” Vistra said in a release.

Cogentrix is indirectly owned by Quantum Capital Group, which purchased it from Carlyle for $3 billion in 2024.

Vistra said it will acquire Cogentrix in a cash-and-stock consideration comprised of $2.3 billion in cash and $900 million in Vistra stock, plus the assumption of $1.5 billion of Cogentrix debt, less around $700 million of expected tax benefits directed from the transaction.

In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Vistra said Goldman Sachs is “committed to provide up to approximately $2 billion in an aggregate principal amount of senior secured bridge loans” to help finance the transaction along with fees and expenses.

Vistra President and CEO Jim Burke said in the release that the acquisition is the “second opportunistic expansion of our generation footprint over the past year to support our ability to serve growing customer demand in our key markets.”

The first expansion was Vistra’s acquisition of 2.6 GW of natural gas capacity from Lotus Infrastructure Partners, a deal that closed in October.

The Cogentrix deal is “attractively priced and shows use of balance sheet to create value accretively,” said Jefferies energy equities analyst Julien Demoulin-Smith in a Tuesday note. “The move to get into New England and diversify on the margin makes abundant sense to us — we see ISO-NE as the most attractive power market in the U.S. given the seemingly unsustainably low price of capacity over time.”

“Watch carefully for evolution, but see this move aligning with our perspective of pivoting into deeper value,” Demoulin-Smith said.

Demoulin-Smith noted that the increase in price since Quantum acquired the portfolio in August 2024 marked a “sharp improvement as the value of power [and] capacity expanded,” and the outlying regulatory approvals needed to move forward. “Regulatory review uncertainty has increased after the [Department of Justice] opposition to [Constellation’s] acquisition of Calpine transaction,” he said.

With the fund up 33% over the past year (more than double the return Chinese EV leader BYD shares), and now the question is whether US technology’s lead can hold.

Tesla and US chipmakers like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) lead in autonomous driving and semiconductor innovation. But BYD’s competitive pressure continues to mount against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), with the Chinese manufacturer expanding its global market share rapidly.

The Trade Policy Wild Card

The biggest macro factor for DRIV isn’t consumer demand or battery costs. It’s trade policy: tariffs and industrial incentives that determine where EVs get built and sold. DRIV holds $340 million in assets split between US tech giants and global automakers. When tariff threats emerge or federal EV tax credits shift, the fund’s diverse holdings react differently.

Watch for announcements from the Office of the US Trade Representative on Chinese EV and battery component tariffs. These typically surface quarterly or around major trade negotiations. The federal EV tax credit structure also matters. Changes favor domestic manufacturers like Tesla and General Motors (NYSE:GM), both top-10 DRIV holdings, while penalizing funds with Chinese exposure.

When tariffs on Chinese solar panels took effect in 2018, US-focused solar ETFs outperformed by double digits. A similar dynamic could play out if stricter EV trade barriers emerge in 2026.

It’s a Chip Fund in Disguise

DRIV’s structure reveals something counterintuitive: information technology represents 29% of holdings, the largest sector allocation. Consumer discretionary, where automakers live, is only 24%. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leads at 4.1% for Waymo’s autonomous tech. NVIDIA and Qualcomm combine for 5% exposure to automotive AI chips.

If the US maintains its EV edge, it won’t be through cheaper cars. It’ll be through superior semiconductors, software, and autonomous systems. DRIV is positioned accordingly. Chinese EV makers like BYD, NIO, and XPeng combine for under 5% of the portfolio.

Check Global X’s monthly fact sheet to track sector drift. If information technology allocation rises above 30%, the fund is doubling down on the US technology advantage thesis. If it falls, managers may be hedging against a scenario where Chinese manufacturers close the gap through volume rather than innovation.

Consider IDRV for Lower Costs

The iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IDRV) offers similar exposure with a 0.47% expense ratio versus DRIV’s 0.68%. That 21 basis point difference compounds over time. IDRV holds $168 million in assets with Tesla as its second-largest position at 4.7%, slightly higher than DRIV’s 3.4%. The trade-off: IDRV has higher Chinese EV exposure with BYD, NIO, and XPeng combining for roughly 11% of the portfolio.

The Bottom Line

Over the next 12 months, watch trade policy announcements from Washington for the macro signal and DRIV’s information technology sector allocation for the micro one. If both trend favorably, the fund’s 33% gain could extend considerably.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock-2351361009-huge-licensed-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 11:59:52.906633

Progress on decarbonization is likely to influence standards for responsible nickel production worldwide, particularly in China, which faces similar challenges in its nickel industry.","Nickel is widely used across many areas, including electronics, aerospace manufacturing, stainless steel and batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage. Despite its growing importance to the clean energy transition, current nickel production is emissions-heavy and associated with significant environmental and social impacts.

Nickel production remains heavily reliant on coal-fired power. In Indonesia, the world’s largest nickel producer, annual production reached 2.2 million tons and accounted for 22% of national emissions from the energy and industrial sectors in 2023. For every ton of nickel produced in Indonesia, an average of 93 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent is released.

At the same time, demand for nickel is expected to grow significantly. Under the International Energy Agency's net-zero scenario, global nickel supply would need to roughly double by 2050, driven mainly by low-carbon technologies such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

To address rising emissions, the Indonesian government has released a policy roadmap targeting an 81% reduction in emissions from the nickel industry by 2045, aligned with national climate commitments and development goals. The government’s commitment to decarbonizing nickel production stems from Indonesia’s aspiration to become a green leader by supplying the minerals needed for the clean energy transition. Decarbonizing nickel production would help attract investment in domestic processing and manufacturing, position Indonesia for long-term competitiveness in the fast-growing battery and EV markets, and reduce the local environmental and health impacts associated with coal-based production.

Home to the world's largest nickel reserves, Indonesia produced nearly two-thirds of global raw nickel (mine production) in 2024, exceeding the combined output of all other producers. The Philippines, the second-largest producer, contributed about 9% of global output.

Many of Indonesia's nickel processing facilities are located in remote areas with limited energy infrastructure and rely on coal-based power to supply the massive amounts of energy required to process laterite nickel ore. Indonesia has 55 nickel processing facilities in operation. The vast majority, 90%, use smelting, a process that melts ore into metal at extremely high temperatures. The remaining 10% use a chemical process known as leaching. The smelting process is the largest source of carbon emissions in Indonesia’s nickel industry, accounting for 97.9% of the sector’s total emissions, or 170.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

In nickel smelting, the final production stage uses electric furnaces to convert ore into metal. The electricity used to power these furnaces accounts for more than 60% of total energy use in the production process, and nearly all of it, 97%, comes from coal-fired power plants built and operated by the nickel industry outside the national grid. The scale of electricity demand in the nickel industry is huge: In 2023, it consumed about 100 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity — enough to power 10 million U.S. homes for a year, or roughly 80% of all household electricity use in Indonesia.

These numbers underscore the need to prioritize decarbonizing Indonesia’s nickel sector. Since these emissions come from a relatively small and identifiable number of industrial sites, they present a major climate opportunity. Targeting action at just a handful of facilities could achieve substantial emissions reductions.

A Tale of Two Smelters

Only one smelter in Indonesia operates primarily on renewable energy: a facility in Sorowako, South Sulawesi, powered by three hydropower plants with a combined capacity of 365 megawatts. Like many nickel smelters, the facility initially relied on coal power but gradually transitioned to hydropower, seeking a cheaper and more reliable long-term option, as hydropower offers greater supply certainty than coal. Following the transition, the facility reduced production costs by 40% per ton of nickel while eliminating 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions each year. In addition to powering the smelter, the hydropower plants generate an extra 8 megawatts of electricity used by the local community.

In Morowali, Central Sulawesi, the situation is markedly different. The region produces about one-third of Indonesia's nickel, and over the past decade the number of smelters has increased tenfold. But renewable energy adoption has stalled. Facilities have installed only small-scale solutions, such as rooftop solar panels for offices and lighting. Larger projects have been proposed, including a 255-megawatt solar facility, but timelines for construction and operation remain uncertain.

What explains the contrast between Sorowako's success and Morowali's struggles? Two factors stand out: proximity and regulation.

Sorowako's smelter was developed with renewable energy in mind and is located near hydropower sources. In contrast, most smelters in Morowali were built far from substantial renewable energy potential and national grid infrastructure. This distance creates immediate logistical challenges. Building transmission lines requires large upfront capital investments with slow returns, reducing the financial attractiveness of renewable energy projects.

However, the barriers extend beyond economics. Distance also introduces significant regulatory challenges. Companies would need to build transmission lines through natural forests, navigating lengthy forest-use permits and land acquisition processes. Even when firms are willing to absorb these costs, they still face constraints related to Indonesia’s state-run electricity monopoly, PLN.

Morowali isn't an isolated case. Much of Indonesia's nickel industry faces similar constraints. In North Maluku, another major production hub, facilities are located even farther from reliable renewable energy resources and lack access to national energy infrastructure, particularly transmission lines.

Replicating Sorowako’s transition will not be straightforward. However, these barriers can be overcome. Infrastructure and policies can evolve. The key question is how to enable that transition at scale.

Decarbonization Pathways for Indonesia’s Nickel Industry

In response to these challenges, the Indonesian government’s decarbonization roadmap for the nickel industry focuses on two core areas: transitioning to clean energy and improving production efficiency.

Powering with Clean Energy

To enable the energy transition in nickel smelters, the roadmap proposes three key elements: clear development plans, an attractive investment ecosystem and government financing support.

The development plans vary by region and are tailored to local conditions. In Sulawesi, an on-grid model is the most viable option. The region already has grid infrastructure and significant renewable energy potential, including hydroelectric resources in Central Sulawesi, wind resources in the south and widely distributed solar potential. The priority is to extend the grid to connect smelters and convert this resource potential into operational renewable energy projects capable of supplying clean power to the industry. By 2045, the roadmap targets an electricity mix for the nickel industry of 61% hydropower, 30% solar power and 9% wind power to achieve the overarching goal of an 81% emissions reduction.

The roadmap’s other regional focus is North Maluku, which hosts a nickel industry comparable in scale to Sulawesi. Decarbonization faces distinct challenges there. The industrial parks are spread across the smaller islands of Halmahera and Obi, which lack existing grid infrastructure and large rivers for hydropower generation. The only viable clean energy sources are solar and wind, but both face land constraints. As a result, an off-grid model is more practical: Industrial parks will need to develop their own clean energy systems, potentially including green hydrogen power plants, to stay on track with decarbonization targets.

Developing these projects will require making them financially viable. At present, PLN, Indonesia’s state-owned electricity utility, caps renewable electricity prices at levels too low to attract sufficient investment. However, simply raising prices could discourage smelters from purchasing PLN-supplied power. To address this, the roadmap proposes an optimized pricing structure: increase solar and wind tariffs by 30% to 50% to improve investment incentives, while reducing hydropower prices by 40% to reflect existing cost competitiveness. Together, these adjustments would result in an estimated 10% increase in PLN’s industrial electricity tariffs — enough to enable renewable projects without imposing significant additional costs on smelters.

Pricing alone won't resolve the infrastructure challenge. Grid expansion faces a fundamental financing constraint: Transmission infrastructure offers low returns on investment, making it unattractive to private investors. Government support is therefore critical. The roadmap calls for financing guarantees and co-investment to reduce risk. It also recommends regulatory reforms to enhance business certainty through a more transparent and efficient permitting process, better integration with regional spatial planning and greater flexibility for private developer participation. Together, these measures would create a more attractive environment for clean energy investment.

Cleaning the Process

Fuel combustion is used at different stages of the smelting process. While the final smelting stage relies on electricity to heat furnaces and melt ore into metal, earlier stages — ore drying and calcination — rely on fuel combustion, typically by burning coal to heat the material before it enters the electric furnace.

These fuel-based stages represent another critical piece of the decarbonization puzzle. They account for one-third of total emissions and, as a result, offer more feasible near-term decarbonization options than the power transition alone. The quickest gains come from efficiency improvements.

This starts with controlling ore quality, since lower-quality ore requires more energy to process. Facilities can also capture and recycle waste heat into earlier production stages. Some facilities have already adopted these practices with clear benefits for both their bottom line and carbon footprint. For example, smelters in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, and Kolaka, South Sulawesi, incorporated waste heat recovery systems at the design stage, reducing energy use in the heating process by 10% and 25%, respectively. The roadmap calls for clearer policies and targets to accelerate adoption of these technologies across the industry.

But efficiency improvements alone won't be enough. The roadmap also identifies fuel and material substitution as key decarbonization measures. Coal used directly in smelters can be replaced by natural gas as a transition fuel, before cleaner options like hydrogen become viable. On the materials side, auxiliary inputs, including reducing agents such as semicoke and anthracite, can be replaced with biochar produced from agricultural waste.

Cost remains a barrier. The government already caps and subsidizes natural gas prices for several industrial sectors, including heavy industries such as steel. Extending this policy to nickel would enable a shift away from coal at manageable cost to the industry. For biochar, price is not the only challenge. Supply remains volatile, and quality is often inconsistent. Addressing these constraints will require national supply chain development, particularly large-scale processing facilities run by state-owned enterprises. Creating this scale would help stabilize supply and ensure consistent quality across the industry.

The Road Ahead for Responsible Nickel

Indonesia has demonstrated that critical mineral producers can build domestic processing industries rather than simply exporting raw materials. The next challenge is to show that industrial development and climate goals can advance together. The decarbonization roadmap offers a blueprint for this transition, setting targets and outlining policies and collective actions needed to overcome financial, technical and regulatory barriers.

Given Indonesia's concentrated nickel supply and growing global demand, how the country manages this transition has implications beyond its borders. Progress on decarbonization is likely to influence standards for responsible nickel production worldwide, particularly in China, which faces similar challenges in its nickel industry. The real test now is implementation: turning the roadmap's vision into tangible change across the sector.

Ultimately, decarbonizing nickel is not just about supporting the energy transition. It's about ensuring that everyday goods, from electronics to household products, are produced responsibly without further fueling climate change.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2026-01/nickel-mining-in-indonesia.jpg?VersionId=bK1NCKwd5RE7KxR8b34Hd8MCBIst2oKr&h=fe48e0cc&itok=o7hWktTd,N,,2026-01-06 13:12:33.013050

In late December, Generac bought the facility from Quad/Graphics for $20 million, according to records from the state Department of Revenue.

Generac said the new facility will allow the company to expand manufacturing of commercial and industrial backup power systems used by data centers and other industries.

The Sussex plant is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2026.

In a statement, Generac President and CEO Aaron Jagdfeld said demand for data center capacity globally is expected to more than triple by the end of the decade, creating “unprecedented demand” for power.

He also said the new facility in Sussex will grow the company’s manufacturing capacity to meet that demand.

“We are uniquely positioned to meet that challenge as a trusted brand focused on backup power solutions for more than 65 years,” Jagdfeld stated. “Our commitment to aggressively invest in serving this booming segment offers a generational opportunity for Generac.”

Along with a new plant in Beaver Dam that opened last summer, and expanded operations in Oshkosh, the company said the new plant in Sussex is part of a strategy aimed at boosting manufacturing capacity for its commercial and industrial products.

Generac said adding “large-megawatt generators” to the company’s product portfolio helped it enter the “rapidly growing” data center market.

During the company’s third quarter 2025 earnings call in October, the most recent earnings report, Jagdfeld said the large scale generators represent a “massive opportunity” for Generac as a “long-standing, well-known” company.

He said the company was already seeing “significant momentum in the data center market” and its order backlog of large-megawatt generators doubled in the third quarter to $300 million.

“The first domestic shipments of these new large-output generators began here in the month of October, and we are projecting strong sequential growth in sales to the data center end market during the fourth quarter,” he said.

Jagdfeld said the data center boom had the potential of doubling Generac’s sales of commercial and industrial products in the next three to five years.

Jagdfeld also hinted at additional expansion plans in October, saying the company was “actively exploring” additional investments in late 2025 to “aggressively” increase manufacturing capacity.

“We expect to undertake several important capacity expansion-related projects and investments during the fourth quarter to position Generac as a significant producer of these products well beyond 2026,” he said.

Jagdfeld said the company needed to add facilities and space because the large-megawatt generators are “big units” that “take up a lot of room.” In October, he said the company was in negotiations on “a number of facilities” both “in Wisconsin and other parts of the U.S.”

Demand for large output generators also helped bolster the company during an “extremely low” power outage environment that lowered demand for home standby and portable generators, said York Ragen, Generac’s chief financial officer.

“Commercial and industrial product sales for the third quarter increased 9 percent to $358 million as compared to $328 million in the prior year,” Ragen said.

That’s as the company’s net sales decreased by 5 percent in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in the prior year, with residential product sales down approximately 13 percent.

The project is positioned as a domestic source of critical minerals that could support electrification and downstream industries, including batteries for uncrewed systems and other defense and aerospace applications previously affected by rare earth and critical mineral constraints.​​

Wendover Lithium Project performance

The Wendover facility is designed to produce 5,000 metric tons per year of battery-grade lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) from existing potash brine operations in Utah. According to project partners, recent test campaigns achieved a lithium extraction rate of 92.9%, with overall lithium chloride purity exceeding 99.5% prior to final conversion.​

In subsequent process steps, Aquatech reports converting the lithium‑rich brine into a lithium carbonate product with purity at or above 99.5%, meeting key specifications for battery manufacturing. This performance suggests that the integrated flow sheet—from selective extraction through concentration and conversion—can consistently deliver material suitable for high‑performance energy storage applications.​

Advanced ionic extraction technology

The Wendover Lithium Project combines Intrepid’s existing brine resource and operational footprint with Aquatech’s process engineering and Adionics’ ionic extraction technology. Adionics’ approach focuses on selectively recovering lithium from complex brine matrices, enabling the partners to convert what was previously treated as waste brine into a strategic mineral stream without developing a greenfield evaporation or mining asset.​

Test results indicate that the process can maintain both high recovery and high purity, two parameters that are critical for scaling lithium production for battery supply chains supporting electric vehicles and uncrewed systems. By leveraging existing industrial infrastructure, the project aims to shorten timelines compared to many early‑stage mining projects in the broader critical minerals sector.​​

Domestic critical minerals supply

Located in Wendover, Utah, the facility is expected to produce enough lithium carbonate equivalent to support around 5,000 EVs over the next decade, while creating new technical and operational jobs in rural Utah. For U.S. manufacturers of drones and other uncrewed platforms that have already faced pressure from China’s rare earth export restrictions and related supply chain disruptions, the emergence of new domestic critical mineral sources is an important part of long‑term resilience planning. Partners state that transforming waste brine into a domestic lithium source aligns with broader efforts to localize critical inputs for batteries, propulsion systems, and mission‑critical electronics.​​

“Intrepid, Aquatech, and Adionics have joined forces to develop the Wendover Lithium Project, which will deliver 5,000 metric tons per year of battery-grade lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) from Utah’s unique potash brine operations,” the companies note, describing the effort as “an unprecedented convergence of proven American resource mastery, world-class engineering excellence, and cutting-edge extraction technology.

Why It Matters Dry coating unlocks other advantages as well.","Ask the average driver what they want from a car, and it isn’t 0-to-60-mile-per-hour times or Nürburgring lap records. It’s something quiet, comfortable, reliable, and inexpensive to run. On all those fronts, the electric vehicle (EV) already offers a better experience than a gasoline car. EVs are more responsive, easier to maintain, and aligned with everyone’s idea of a sustainable future. After all, no one pictures a futuristic city cloaked in exhaust fumes.

Yet mass adoption isn’t driven by enthusiasts—it’s driven by the everyday buyer. And for that buyer, EVs remain too costly. Global EV sales passed roughly 20 percent of new cars in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency, but the inflection point for true mass adoption still lies ahead. Some major Western automakers are signaling caution: GM, for example, paused production of the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq in December and will run only a single shift at its Spring Hill, Tenn., plant through early 2026—an acknowledgment of softer near-term U.S. demand and rising costs. Meanwhile, global BEV growth is being pulled forward by China. If demand worldwide is rising while Western manufacturers slow production, the industry may be entering a major shake-out. Automakers cannot sustain a multiyear cost disadvantage against Chinese competitors, and only a handful that close that gap will emerge as long-term winners. And closing it ultimately comes down to building far cheaper batteries. To reach true mass-market penetration, EVs must match internal-combustion cars on both range and affordability—roughly 400 miles for US $20,000 to $25,000. That’s a tall order, because batteries make up about 40 percent of an EV’s cost, and the cells themselves dominate that figure. BloombergNEF’s most recent battery-price survey found that cell manufacturing is now the single biggest determinant of whether a vehicle can be profitably priced for the mass market.

Where the cost lies

About 70 percent of an EV battery cell’s cost comes from materials—the cathodes and anode active materials, separators, and current collectors—and 30 percent from manufacturing, according to data from Thunder Said Energy, an Austin, Texas–based consultancy focused on energy technologies. Progress on both fronts is vital. Chemistries such as lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) are steadily improving in cost and performance, and researchers are exploring cheaper current-collector materials and boosting energy density with low-cost silicon-doped anodes. But even as materials evolve, the way we build cells has changed remarkably little.

Today’s “wet-coating” process still resembles how it was done decades ago: active powders mixed with toxic solvents, spread as slurries onto metal foil, and dried in industrial ovens the length of a football field. A 50-gigawatt-hour cell factory—enough for about a million EVs per year—can require 50 megawatts of continuous power just for those ovens, according to a 2022 study in the Journal of Power Sources. That’s equivalent to the electricity demand of roughly 40,000 homes, the U.S. Energy Information Administration notes. The environmental and capital costs are enormous.

Rethinking the factory floor

That’s why the industry’s attention is turning toward dry electrode manufacturing. In principle, eliminating solvents from electrode coating could cut both energy use and cost, while shrinking factory footprints. But getting dry coating to work at scale has proven extremely difficult. Without liquids, it’s hard to mix and spread the fine powders evenly, maintain strong adhesion, and avoid damaging the materials through heat and friction.

At Anaphite, my company (which is located in Bristol, England), we’ve spent nearly five years developing an alternative we call our Dry Coating Precursor (DCP) technology. We start with low-toxicity solvents to disperse materials uniformly, then remove the solvent mechanically before dry coating. The resulting film-forming powder behaves almost like kinetic sand: granular when loose, cohesive under pressure. During manufacturing, it transforms into a smooth, flexible electrode layer that bonds tightly to its current collector.

The payoff is dramatic—an 85 percent reduction in coating-process energy use, up to 40 percent lower cell-production cost, and a 15 percent smaller factory footprint, all without compromising yield or performance. These savings compound rapidly: percentage points shaved from cell cost can determine whether a vehicle remains niche or achieves true mass-market pricing.

Parallel paths toward the same goal

Anaphite is not alone in this pursuit. On a recent episode of the Volts podcast, Karl Littau, CTO of San Jose, Calif.–based Sakuù, described his company’s solvent-free “laser-printing” method, which he likens to “frosting a cake—without the mess.” Instead of wet slurries and ovens, Sakuù’s Kavian platform fuses dry powders directly onto foil with heat and pressure. Their approach can print electrodes of nearly any chemistry—LFP, NMC, or even formulations yet to be invented—by simply swapping material cartridges. In pilot programs, Sakuù reports that its process cuts carbon-dioxide emissions by about 55 percent, shrinks factory size by 60 percent, and slashes utility costs by more than half.

The machines themselves are modular and compact—“They could go in a garage,” Littau says—allowing manufacturers to scale production by adding units rather than constructing vast, energy-hungry facilities. While Anaphite and Sakuù take different engineering routes, the destination is the same: a low-cost, low-energy, high-throughput future for battery manufacturing.

Why It Matters

Dry coating unlocks other advantages as well. It enables thicker electrodes, which reduce the proportion of inactive materials and increase both gravimetric and volumetric energy density. The result: batteries that offer higher range per kilogram and per cubic centimeter. Combine that with EVs’ inherent benefits—quietness, smoothness, and low operating costs—and the case for electrification becomes irresistible.

Whether through DCP, Kavion, or the next breakthrough waiting in a lab somewhere, the dry-coating revolution promises to make clean mobility truly mainstream—bringing forward the day when buying an EV isn’t just the cleaner choice; it’s the obvious one.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-wearing-a-white-lab-coat-and-a-full-respirator-pours-a-powder-onto-a-metallic-testing-rig-with-holes-like-a-kitchen-col.jpg?id=62667826&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=60%2C0%2C61%2C0,N,,2026-01-06 11:59:56.619488

Against this backdrop, NextEra Energy and Google Cloud’s latest move to deepen their partnership represents a major stride in the convergence of energy generation and AI infrastructure.

The two companies plan to co-develop new gigawatt-scale data centres — each with dedicated power plants designed to meet their immense energy requirements.

“Our partnership with Google exemplifies this very singular moment when energy and technology are becoming inextricably intertwined,” says John Ketchum, Chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy.

“Together, we intend to build data centre capacity and energy infrastructure at scale, advance cutting-edge technology and reimagine how energy companies operate.

“By combining NextEra Energy’s unmatched skills as America’s leading energy infrastructure builder and operator with Google’s world-class technology expertise, we will help transform the energy sector.”

How Google Cloud will power NextEra’s digital transformation

Google Cloud’s AI and infrastructure capabilities will drive NextEra Energy’s AI acceleration journey.

The first commercial solution from this collaboration is expected to launch by mid-2026, available via the Google Cloud Marketplace.

By integrating Google’s Gen and agentic AI with NextEra’s asset data, the energy company aims to cut costs and enhance workforce safety.

This integration enables predictive issue detection, proactive responses to supply chain delays, crew availability challenges and weather disruptions — improving operational efficiency and reliability across the grid.

The partnership also promises a more resilient energy network, safeguarded against storm-related disruptions using Google’s open-source forecasting model TimesFM 2.5 and advanced weather prediction system WeatherNext 2.

Through Google’s security-constrained power flow modelling and other open-source optimisation tools, NextEra Energy will gain advanced grid management and utility planning capabilities — significantly reducing costs while strengthening energy reliability.

“Working with NextEra Energy to power our infrastructure growth further strengthens our long-standing collaboration and will help us meet increasing demand from our customers as they deploy AI technologies at scale,” says Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud.

“By infusing NextEra Energy’s deep domain expertise with Google Cloud’s AI infrastructure, platform and models, we can together support the digital future of energy infrastructure.”

A symbiotic model for the AI-energy age

Currently, three joint data centre campuses are under construction across the United States, with additional sites under consideration.

This collaboration builds on an established relationship — the two companies already share nearly 3.5 GW of combined energy deals under contract and in operation.

Further demonstrating their alignment, both recently announced plans to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Centre in Iowa, using nuclear power to support Google’s AI infrastructure.

As AI’s rapid growth continues to drive demand for energy-hungry data centres, partnerships like this underscore the mutual benefits of closer collaboration between energy providers and technology leaders.

The sites will be backed by renewable power and a new $30 million (£23.7m) Energy Impact Fund designed to support local clean energy and efficiency projects.

Around 375 data centres are operating across Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio with another 70 under construction. Cheap power abundant land and a business-friendly climate have made the state irresistible.

The problem is electricity.

Power requests linked to data and AI centres tracked by the Texas grid operator ERCOT have surged from 56GW to 205GW in just one year. That near-quadrupling is forcing a rethink of how the grid is planned and paid for.

The sheer scale of new demand – particularly from AI workloads – will require changes to ensure reliability. The risk is not theoretical, Texas already runs tight during extreme summer heat when air conditioning demand peaks.

Google says it will bring new generation onto the grid and pay the costs linked to its operations. The company has already contracted more than 6,200MW of clean energy through power purchase agreements in Texas.

Not every project will be fully self-powered. Some new mega-sites are expected to combine grid electricity with on-site gas generation creating hybrid models that blur the line between private power plants and public infrastructure.

In 2026, Detroit will continue drawing major events.","Detroit enters 2026 at a crossroads politically, economically, and structurally.

It will be defined by the arrival of a new mayoral administration, a revamped City Council, and a statewide election cycle that promises intense attention on Detroit’s voters, and these events and others have set the stage for a transformative year.

Meanwhile, neighborhoods continue demanding fairness: fair housing, fair policing, fair taxation, and fair representation. And after the Detroit Reparations Task Force submitted its sprawling 558-page report in late 2025, the question of how Detroit repairs past harms — or whether it will at all — hangs over everything.

As the city prepares for what could be one of the most consequential years in recent memory, the Michigan Chronicle has identified 10 of the most important issues Detroiters should watch in 2026.

These challenges will shape not just the political headlines, but everyday life: how families live, what neighborhoods look like, whether businesses thrive, and what kind of city Detroit chooses to become.

1. Reparations at a Turning Point: Will Detroit Act — or Retreat?

When the Detroit Reparations Task Force delivered its long-awaited report in October 2025, it presented a list of policy proposals while at the same time outlining a moral reckoning. Housing investment, water affordability, business grants, environmental remediation zones, police accountability reforms — the plan offered a comprehensive roadmap for generational repair.

In 2026, the plan’s fate hangs entirely in political hands.

Neither former mayor Mike Duggan nor new mayor Mary Sheffield have publicly committed to any portion of the report. City Council members are divided — some arguing for incremental adoption, others expressing skepticism about cost, implementation, or eligibility requirements tied to lineage.

Meanwhile, community activists insist that a ballot-initiated Task Force — launched with overwhelming voter support — demands more than symbolic acknowledgment. They expect action. Whether the city embraces the report or buries it in committees will reveal Detroit’s political soul.

This year, residents should watch for:

Whether council will adopt any of the recommended housing grants or water reforms.

How the city plans to define eligibility and verify lineage.

Whether a Reparations Administrative Office will be created — the backbone of program implementation.

How Detroit navigates funding debates without pitting neighborhoods against downtown interests.

2026 could mark either the birth of modern municipal reparations — or the moment Detroit turns away from bold repair.

2. Mayor Mary Sheffield’s First Full Year: Leadership, Priorities, and Power

Detroit’s new mayor enters office at a time of both opportunity and volatility. The first 12 months will reveal priorities, governing style, and political alliances — especially around development, public safety, and neighborhood investment.

Key areas to watch:

Hiring and departmental restructuring: The administration has already began to bring in fresh leadership, but she’s also showing that she will rely on continuity in certain departments like communications and neighborhoods?

Development philosophy: Does this administration break from the city’s decade-long downtown-first model? Or continue tax incentives and mega-project partnerships?

Budget choices: The 2026–2027 budget cycle will show where spending shifts — particularly in response to the reparations report, housing demands, policing reform, and a lack of federal funds the city has been getting for the past half decade from COVID relief.

Neighborhood engagement: A central question: Will the new mayor create meaningful channels for community participation or rely on traditional top-down processes?

Detroit hasn’t seen an open mayoral transition in years. The political mood is shifting — and the Chronicle will be watching how the new administration sets the tone.

3. City Council Dynamics: Budgets, Battles, and Political Ambitions

The mayor’s office sets the agenda, but City Council will determine how — or if — it gets executed.

And with new members who have differing political beliefs, expect there to be some early headlines about how well the group will mesh.

Council members are already bracing for fights over:

tax abatements and developer incentives

police funding and oversight

water affordability and drainage fees

expansion or rollbacks in surveillance technology

enforcement of community benefits agreements

The budget season, beginning in spring, will be especially trying.

A critical storyline: Will council unify or splinter into factions that slow progress on key issues?

Detroit’s governance in 2026 will live or die on the relationship between council and the mayor’s office.

4. Development Flashpoints: District Detroit, I-375, and Neighborhood Revitalization

Detroit’s development landscape is entering a new phase — one defined by questions of equity and accountability.

District Detroit projects, shepherded by Ilitch and Olympia Development, remain a lightning rod after years of stalled promises and generous tax breaks. In 2026, several key developments are scheduled to hit major milestones, and residents are watching to see whether promised jobs, housing, and community benefits materialize.

Michigan transportation officials pressed pause on a plan to reconnect Detroit neighborhoods with the I-375 Reconnecting Communities Project, saying the $500 million effort to replace the sunken freeway with a surface boulevard would not break ground in 2025 as planned. The Michigan Department of Transportation cited surging costs, concerns about long-term durability, and sustained public opposition as reasons for the delay. While the project might not take off in 2026 either, planning for it will be imperative this year.

And across Detroit’s neighborhoods, redevelopment remains uneven. Community groups want:

more affordable housing that matches local incomes

repair funds, not displacement

fewer corporate abatements

stronger enforcement of Community Benefits Agreements

a real strategy for vacant land and commercial corridors

2026 could redefine whose interests Detroit’s development machine serves — the corporate core, or the long-neglected neighborhoods beyond it.

5. Detroit Public Schools and the Fight for Education Funding

Detroit education policy is entering one of its most uncertain eras. The district faces:

aging buildings with billions in deferred maintenance

persistent teacher shortages

declining enrollment

challenges expanding mental-health and wraparound services

digital access disparities

pressure from charter school expansion

State funding remains the biggest obstacle. Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD) continues pushing for equitable per-pupil funding, facilities support, and legislative revisions that address decades of underinvestment.

2026 will also feature debates over:

use of formerly shuttered school buildings

implementation of African-centered curriculum initiatives

youth sports infrastructure

free internet access programs

STEM and skilled trades expansion

The future of Detroit’s children — and the future of the city — hinges on what Lansing and local leaders decide this year.

6. Transportation and Mobility: A System Struggling to Meet a Growing Need

If Detroit wants true economic mobility, it needs physical mobility. And right now, the system is strained.

Although service in recent years has drastically improved, DDOT continues to grapple with:

unreliable bus schedules

driver shortages

aging fleets

inconsistent safety and cleanliness

Meanwhile, repeated attempts to build a coherent regional transit system — linking Detroit to Metro Airport, the suburbs, and major employment zones — remain stalled by political resistance outside the city.

In 2026, key developments to watch include:

potential regional transit ballot initiatives

state-level road funding tied to electric vehicle adoption

mobility pilot programs (microtransit, autonomous shuttles, bike and e-scooter expansion)

long-term plans for walkability and safe streets in neighborhoods

Detroit’s transportation infrastructure is a mirror of its inequality. 2026 could be the year the city decides whether mobility becomes a right — or remains an afterthought.

7. Water, Sewage, and Stormwater Reform — Detroit’s Infrastructure Reckoning

Few issues cut as deeply across class, race, and neighborhood lines as water.

After years of shutoffs, drainage fees, basement flooding, and tension with the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), Detroit enters 2026 with an opportunity to reshape its water future.

Key storylines:

Affordability: Will Detroit adopt an income-based billing system that caps water and sewer charges at a percentage of household earnings?

GLWA negotiations: Detroit currently shoulders the vast majority of sewer system costs. Leaders are pushing for a more equitable cost-sharing model.

Flood mitigation: With heavier rains fueled by climate change, Detroit must accelerate stormwater infrastructure upgrades — or face repeated basement backups and neighborhood damage.

Liens and shutoffs: Advocates want the city to permanently end the practice of converting water debt into property liens.

Water is more than a utility. It’s a justice issue. And 2026 will test whether Detroit treats it that way.

8. Public Safety and Policing: Trust, Transparency, and Transformation

Policing remains one of Detroit’s most emotionally charged issues. In 2026, several debates will take center stage:

Police accountability: Calls for greater civilian oversight, transparency in use-of-force cases, and restrictions on surveillance technology will intensify.

Staffing shortages: The department continues struggling with retention and recruitment — particularly of Black officers.

The future of “One Detroit”: Advocates want to dismantle the multi-agency initiative, which they argue over-polices Black neighborhoods.

Community-based alternatives: Grassroots violence interruption groups, restorative justice programs, and mental-health response teams are asking for stable and expanded funding.

Technology: Facial recognition, license plate readers, and real-time crime centers will face renewed scrutiny.

Public safety in Detroit is not a binary debate. It’s a question of equity, accountability, and whether the city can invest in safety without sacrificing the civil rights of its residents.

9. Michigan’s 2026 Statewide Elections — and Their Implications for Detroit

Detroit’s political power often lies in its turnout. In 2026, every major statewide office is on the ballot, including governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and all 148 state legislative seats.

What’s at stake for Detroit?

school funding and facilities dollars

water affordability legislation

environmental justice enforcement

transportation and transit funding

criminal justice reforms

community development grants

tax policy affecting cities and families

Expect national attention on Detroit’s voters — especially young voters, Black voters, working-class families, and residents in neighborhoods that have historically been ignored by statewide campaigns.

Candidates who win statewide will shape Detroit’s fiscal, educational, environmental, and economic landscape for years to come.

10. Big Events & Detroit’s National Spotlight: Who Really Benefits?

In recent years, Detroit has hosted major national events — from the NFL Draft to prominent conferences and cultural festivals. These events bring visitors, media attention, and investment.

But they also raise important questions:

Do the economic benefits reach neighborhoods, or remain concentrated downtown?

Who gets contracts and vendor opportunities — big companies or local small businesses?

Are residents displaced or inconvenienced by event-related construction, closures, or policing?

How does the city leverage national attention to strengthen long-term community investment?

In 2026, Detroit will continue drawing major events. The Chronicle will be watching whether these moments become catalysts for inclusive growth — or simply downtown spectacles.

Looking Ahead: A City Defining Its Future

Detroit has been here before — at moments of potential transformation, where decisions made in council chambers and state capitols ripple into classroom sizes, water bills, bus stops, police encounters, housing stability, and neighborhood futures.

But 2026 feels different. The stakes seem clearer. The demands from residents are louder, more organized, and more urgent. But the vision also seems brighter with Mary Sheffield at the helm.

This year will test whether Detroit’s leadership is bold enough to confront the city’s deepest structural issues — or whether familiar patterns of delay, division, and deferral take hold again.

What happens next — in reparations debates, school funding battles, development negotiations, water reform, and political showdowns — will shape Detroit for decades.

And the Michigan Chronicle will be here to cover it, ask the hard questions, and amplify the community voices that must be at the center of every decision.",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/10-issues-in-2026-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 10:59:54.045764

105 groups and organizations (“EOs”) sent a December 16th letter to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Administrator opposing the agency’s Motion for Vacatur (“Motion”) in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in regard to pending challenges to the PM2.5 Clean Air Act National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”).

The EOs state in the December 16th letter that they are:

… gravely concerned by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recent action abandoning its defense of national health-protection pollution standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5 or soot).

EPA strengthened the PM2.5 NAAQS in 2024. The EOs argue that such strengthening was:

… in line with scientific, health-based evidence; consensus among experts that the existing standards were insufficiently protective; and the EPA’s statutory requirement to promulgate NAAQS that protect human health with a margin of safety.

They further argue that EPA has not disputed what they describe as the “overwhelming scientific evidence” supporting the NAAQS.

EPA in a November 24th Motion argued that in previously revising the PM2.5 NAAQS that it based its action on an erroneous interpretation of the Clean Air Act and exceeded its authority by revising the standard without initiating and completing a thorough review. The agency further argued that the result was:

… an unlawful tightening of the annual standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from 12.0 µg/m³ to 9.0 µg/m³, without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required. EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule before the area designation deadline of February 7, 2026.

The EOs ask that EPA “realign itself to its core mission and recommit itself to taking action that would truly protect human health and the environment.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 09:59:44.216908

While federal shifts under the current administration led to the termination of programs like the Environmental Protection Agency’s $156 million “Solar for All” grant for Michigan, local utility-scale projects are insulated by private financing and existing state-level utility mandates.

Three primary solar developments in Branch County continue to move forward as they rely on private investment and long-term utility contracts rather than the now-canceled federal grants.

Branch Solar Project, Developed by NorthStar Clean Energy for Consumers Energy, a 200-megawatt (MW) facility is expected to come online in February .

The project, located on over 1,500 acres in Union and Bethel Townships, secured $334 million in private construction-to-term financing, protecting it from federal budget cuts.

Coldwater Solar is a 150 MW facility, developed by Apex Clean Energy in Coldwater and Ovid Townships, is nearing its final operational phase after construction began in 2024. The project is slated to power approximately 30,000 homes annually.

DTE’s Cold Creek Solar Park is funded by Ford Motor Company’s clean energy agreement with DTE Energy, through the MIGreenPower program.

This was the largest purchase from a utility in U.S. history. DTE officials say when completed later this year, the park will enable Ford to attribute 100% of electricity used in its Michigan assembly plants to carbon-free, renewable energy.

The 100 megawatt solar panel project spans Coldwater, Quincy, and Butler Townships on leased property east of Fiske Road to Ridge Road, between Jonesville Road to just north of U.S. 12.

The federal funding cuts, which impacted seven major programs across Michigan, were primarily aimed at initiatives for low-income rooftop solar, energy efficiency upgrades, and green manufacturing.

The single largest loss was the $156 million solar program for disadvantaged communities. Other cancellations included $170 million for facility efficiency and grants for electric vehicle manufacturing plants in other parts of the state.

Branch County’s utility-scale solar farms differ from the canceled grant-dependent projects because they are “market-driven” and supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission, which continues to oversee the state’s transition to an 80% clean energy standard by 2035.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2484/files/2026/01/solar-faq-slider-for-site-1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 12:00:14.787005

My AEI colleague Mark Jamison argues that the right response here is to make it easier to expand the American power system.
Bottom line: Modernizing electricity regulation—rather than singling out data centers—is the best way to keep power affordable and preserve America’s edge in AI.","Americans staring wide-eyed at higher electricity bills have found a handy arch-villain: Big Tech and their artificial-intelligence data centers. These warehouse-size supercomputers are often portrayed by critics—politicians in both parties included—as massive energy hogs. And they certainly use a lot of juice, no doubt about it. Yet the best evidence suggests that, in many places, the biggest force pushing prices higher right now are less dramatic: the U.S. power grid itself.

Keep in mind that the economics of the sector can be counterintuitive. A new Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analysis reveals that from 2019 to 2024, places with spikes in electricity demand often didn’t see higher prices—and in some cases even saw lower ones. That’s because electricity costs are dominated by fixed expenses, not the marginal cost of pushing more electrons through the system. In some situations, adding customers or load spreads those fixed grid costs over more kilowatt-hours, which can soften price increases—or even lower them.

What did rise sharply were the costs of keeping the grid in working order and making it tougher against storms and other disasters. The LBNL study finds that recent increases in retail electricity prices were often driven by higher spending on transmission and distribution—especially investments to replace and harden aging infrastructure—alongside other factors that varied by state.

Moreover, a research summary in The Washington Post adds longer-term context, noting that transmission costs have nearly tripled and distribution costs have more than doubled over the past two decades, with the prices of key components such as transformers and wires rising faster than inflation. (The Post also highlights disaster-hardening expenses, including wildfire-related costs in California.)

So where do AI data centers fit into the story? Mostly, it seems, as an accelerant in specific regions rather than the main national driver. For example: The Wall Street Journal reports that New Jersey electricity prices were up about 19 percent year-on-year in August, citing several driving forces, including “a rapidly growing number of data centers pumping up demand in some regions [along with the] slow addition of new power generators, retirement of old plants. and costly grid upgrades are also playing a role. In other words, data centers tend to push prices higher where the grid is already stretched, rather than automatically driving up bills everywhere.

Still, over the next decade, the data-center role could shift from supporting player in certain locales to a full-fledged co-star across the country. An S&P Global forecast says utility-supplied power to hyperscale, leased, and crypto-mining data centers will rise from around 62 GW today to 134GW by 2030. At that scale, the relevant question isn’t “do they use a lot of power?” It’s “who pays for the new plants, substations, and lines, and how fast can the system build them?”

That’s where policy comes in. My AEI colleague Mark Jamison argues that the right response here is to make it easier to expand the American power system. He says current rules in many places were built for an era of slow, predictable growth and now make it harder to invest quickly. Jamison calls for faster permitting, clearer federal rules, and fewer limits on utility investment and power generation, including nuclear energy. Without those changes, he warns, the grid will struggle to keep up, driving up costs and forcing data centers to rely on expensive backup systems.

The House and Senate are set to take up the compromise three-bill “minibus” this month with hopes of providing updated funding levels for the Department of Energy, the Interior Department, EPA and a number of science agencies for the first time in nearly two years.

The release of the fiscal 2026 measures — Energy-Water, Interior-Environment and Commerce-Justice-Science — marks significant progress for appropriators, who have struggled to coalesce on a strategy to fund the government after passing an initial batch of three funding bills late last year.

Congress’ funding deadline of Jan. 30 is four weeks away, and the bipartisan, bicameral agreement on three more bills provides badly needed momentum as lawmakers try to avoid another costly government shutdown.

“President Trump set an important foundation by signing three appropriations bills into law in November, and we are carrying that momentum into the new year,” said House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) in a statement.

“Developed through committee-led negotiations and thoughtful deliberation,” Cole added, “this package demonstrates how an accountable process produces strong policy.”

Indeed, the negotiated minibus contains provisions supported by leaders on both sides of the aisle and funding levels that reflect a compromise between the severe cuts that Republicans proposed and the boosts that Democrats were aiming for. In general, the package would cut spending relative to a continuation of Biden-era spending levels.

Negotiators left out so-called poison-pill policy riders that would have undermined bipartisan support, including a proposal about federal lands favored by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Still, the GOP majority secured a number of conservative wins. Beyond cuts to EPA and the Department of the Interior overall, the package proposes to eliminate DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and defund the Office of Energy Justice and Equity.

Some bipartisan priorities were left on the cutting room floor, and appropriators sought a middle ground on others, such as an effort to create a new, consolidated wildland firefighting agency.

“There’ll always be hurdles, and it’s not a perfect bill, but I’m proud of it,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), chair of the Senate Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee.

Appropriators mostly defy Trump

Appropriators sprinkled cuts to some energy and environment programs throughout the spending package but avoided the much steeper reductions to Democratic-favored initiatives that the Trump administration proposed last year.

A number of energy and environment programs would maintain their current funding levels under the legislation.

EPA is facing a $320 million, or 4 percent, cut to its top-line budget — a much smaller slash than the more than $4 billion reduction President Donald Trump requested.

DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy would face a cut much smaller than the one proposed by Republicans. Democrats said the bill rejects Trump’s proposal to “zero out funding for critical solar, wind, and hydrogen research programs.”

“It’s no secret that reduction in spending came primarily from nondefense, and more specifically, the Green New Deal provisions under President [Joe] Biden,” Kennedy said in a brief interview, adding that nondefense spending in the Energy-Water bill would decrease by more than 3 percent.

“President Biden spent an enormous amount of money — enormous amount of money — on the Green New Deal, and it’s time we spent money on things we need more right now, like nuclear,” Kennedy added. Republicans often use “Green New Deal” to refer to renewable energy and climate programs.

The Energy-Water bill would boost funding for advanced nuclear energy development, as well as for nuclear weapons programs.

At the Department of Energy, negotiators are proposing to eliminate the Biden-era Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and to zero out funding for the Office of Energy Justice and Equity, as DOE proposed in a reorganization last year.

Appropriators rebuffed the White House’s bid to zero out funding for the popular Diesel Emissions Reduction Act grant program, which would get the same amount of money as last year. The Targeted Airshed Grant Program would also be level-funded.

The Interior Department overall would get about $14.5 billion, a cut of more than $200 million, with some of those cuts coming from renewable energy programs. Oil, gas and mineral production programs would see increases.

The Bureau of Land Management would get $1.34 billion, which is slightly less than Biden-era funding levels but hundreds of millions of dollars more than Trump proposed. The legislation proposes increases for oil production programs at both BLM and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

For the Forest Service, appropriators proposed $8.61 billion in discretionary spending and rejected the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to state forestry grant programs and research.

The National Park Service would be spared a 37 percent cut requested by the White House. Appropriators would instead give the public land agency $3.27 billion, a moderate drop from the current level.

Funding for the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality would stay about equal at $4.6 million.

Policy riders

Democrats and Republicans on Monday touted a lack of “poison-pill” policy riders in the spending package, which could have further complicated final passage.

“Despite their efforts to include over 140 hyper-partisan line items that would have weakened gun safety regulations, expanded oil and gas leasing on federal land, diminished investments in renewable energy, and imposed cruel culture-war constraints on LGBTQ+ Americans, none of these provisions were ultimately included,” House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said in a statement. “Democrats successfully defeated every single one.”

Still, lawmakers added a number of riders on oil reserves, endangered species, public lands and myriad other energy and environment issues.

Appropriators included language to the Interior-Environment bill report asserting that the Interior Department “shall maintain ownership of Federal lands” that are designated as national parks, among other categorizations.

Lee filed an amendment to the Senate’s version of the Interior-Environment bill last month that would have struck that language, angering conservation advocates who accused Lee of trying to sell public lands.

The package contains language to prevent the sage grouse from being listed as an endangered species and to exempt farmers and ranchers from certain greenhouse gas reporting requirements.

The bill does not extend a prohibition on staffing reductions at the Interior Department, which had been included in the stopgap funding bill that Congress passed in November.

Still, the package requires agencies such as the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management to “maintain staffing levels in order to fulfill the mission required.”

The Energy-Water title would prohibit DOE from providing financial assistance to any foreign entity of concern. It would also bar the agency from selling crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the Chinese government.

Consolidated wildfire agency

Appropriators denied a bipartisan push to establish a new, consolidated wildland fire agency at the Interior Department by moving fire services out of the Agriculture Department’s Forest Service.

Instead, lawmakers ordered the Interior and Agriculture secretaries to hire a nonpartisan research organization to do a feasibility study of a new fire agency, assessing the potential impacts of consolidating fire responsibilities and how a new agency would differ from the National Interagency Fire Center, which already coordinates fire response on public lands.

The agencies are also required to submit funding estimates and staffing plans for a new agency to appropriators.

The Forest Service’s wildfire management programs stand to get $2.4 billion in discretionary funding, plus a $2.48 billion budget cap adjustment for disaster-related spending. Non-fire-related accounts would get $3.71 billion.

Water projects protected

The bipartisan agreement shores up funding for the Army Corps of Engineers after a year in which Congress did not approve any earmarks for water infrastructure projects.

Without new congressional direction for water projects, the Trump administration unilaterally canceled or froze funding for numerous Army Corps projects, almost entirely in Democratic-led states.

Under the new spending package, the Army Corps would get $10.4 billion, an increase of nearly $2 billion relative to the fiscal 2025 levels. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund would receive an estimated $3.5 billion, an increase of $702 million, according to a bill summary.

“We increased the budget for the Corps of Engineers by 19 percent, and I think my Senate colleagues — and presumably my House colleagues — are gonna be very excited about that,” Kennedy said.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Kennedy’s counterpart on the Energy-Water Subcommittee, cast the minibus’ Army Corps funding as an opportunity to ensure the Trump administration spends funds on projects as Congress intends.

“Passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and [White House budget chief] Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent — by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions,” Murray said in a statement.

The Bureau of Reclamation would get $1.65 billion, a reduction of about 11 percent. The Bureau’s WaterSMART program would get an increase of $354 million relative to its current level.

EPA’s state revolving funds would receive $2.76 billion, roughly $2.46 billion more than the amount requested by the White House.

About $1.6 billion of that amount would support congressionally earmarked water and wastewater projects. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program would get $72.3 million, the same as it received in fiscal 2025.

Science, climate programs survive

While Colorado’s National Center for Atmospheric Research would not be explicitly protected from the administration’s attacks, most science and climate research programs would be spared the White House’s proposed reductions.

“Our bill makes clear that Congress, on a bipartisan basis, will not accept this Administration’s reckless, harmful cuts,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), ranking member on the Senate’s CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a statement.

The Commerce-Justice-Science bill would provide about $6.2 billion for NOAA — more than Republicans proposed — and would increase funding for the National Weather Service, including a $10 million boost to support staffing at weather forecast offices.

The legislation exceeds the White House’s request for NOAA weather and climate satellites by $135 million, according to Van Hollen’s office.

The National Science Foundation would get about $8.8 billion, maintaining fiscal 2025 funding levels for a range of research activities. House Republicans had floated deep cuts to NSF.

NASA would receive $24.4 billion, including support for the Artemis program and the agency’s “STEM” education initiatives.

The legislation would block a DOE move last year to cap indirect costs for research and demonstration grants. It would also block some of DOE’s reorganizations plans.

DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy would get $350 million , a reduction of $110 million relative to the fiscal 2025 level.

Appropriations outlook, Colorado holds

The funding package appears likely to clear the House and Senate and become law before the end of the month, but the road to final passage will be bumpy.

The House is expected to vote on the minibus as soon as Thursday. But first, it will have to go through the Rules Committee on Tuesday, where conservatives may protest some of the funding levels or argue that the legislation does not go far enough in advancing President Donald Trump’s agenda.

If the package passes the House, it will head to the Senate, where Colorado’s Democratic senators have already placed holds on he legislation because it does not address the Trump administration’s decision last month to “dismantle” the National Center for Atmospheric Research in their home state.

“We’re going to consider all our options,” Sen. Michael Bennet said Monday. “I wish the language were in there. There’s a broad, I think, bipartisan view that NCAR does incredibly important work for this country, and I still hope we’ll find a way to fund it.”

A spokesperson for Sen. John Hickenlooper confirmed that the senator is prepared to block progress on the package due to similar concerns.

The minibus could also face opposition from conservative senators who have previously protested the billions of dollars in funding earmarked for projects in lawmakers’ home states and districts.

The potential opposition means it could take a couple of weeks for Senate leaders to strike an agreement to vote on the measure, pinning a final vote on the package up against the funding deadline.

Appropriators have discussed the possibility of pairing the minibus with another funding stopgap bill to prevent a shutdown after Jan. 30 and buy more time to pass the remaining six fiscal 2026 spending bills, which are considered even more contentious.

And Nigeria possesses abundant renewable energy resources across the country, which are largely untapped: solar, hydro, geothermal and wind, providing new opportunities.

Globally, the agency expects investment in renewable energy in 2025 to be twice that of fossil fuels.
The conference will be hosted by Turkey, but Australia, which supported the call for a road map, will be leading the negotiations.","Two years ago, countries around the world set a goal of “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly and equitable manner.” The plan included tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency gains by 2030 – important steps for slowing climate change since the energy sector makes up about 75% of the global carbon dioxide emissions that are heating up the planet.

The world is making progress: More than 90% of new power capacity added in 2024 came from renewable energy sources, and 2025 saw similar growth.

However, fossil fuel production is also still expanding. And the United States, the world’s leading producer of both oil and natural gas, is now aggressively pressuring countries to keep buying and burning fossil fuels.

The energy transition was not meant to be a main topic when world leaders and negotiators met at the 2025 United Nations climate summit, COP30, in November in Belém, Brazil. But it took center stage from the start to the very end, bringing attention to the real-world geopolitical energy debate underway and the stakes at hand.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began the conference by calling for the creation of a formal road map, essentially a strategic process in which countries could participate to “overcome dependence on fossil fuels.” It would take the global decision to transition away from fossil fuels from words to action.

More than 80 countries said they supported the idea, ranging from vulnerable small island nations like Vanuatu that are losing land and lives from sea level rise and more intense storms, to countries like Kenya that see business opportunities in clean energy, to Australia, a large fossil-fuel-producing country.

Opposition, led by the Arab Group’s oil- and gas-producing countries, kept any mention of a “road map” energy transition plan out of the final agreement from the climate conference, but supporters are pushing ahead.

I was in Belém for COP30, and I follow developments closely as former special climate envoy and head of delegation for Germany and senior fellow at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. The fight over whether there should even be a road map shows how much countries that depend on fossil fuels are working to slow down the transition, and how others are positioning themselves to benefit from the growth of renewables. And it is a key area to watch in 2026.

The battle between electro-states and petro-states

Brazilian diplomat and COP30 President André Aranha Corrêa do Lago has committed to lead an effort in 2026 to create two road maps: one on halting and reversing deforestation and another on transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly and equitable manner.

What those road maps will look like is still unclear. They are likely to be centered on a process for countries to discuss and debate how to reverse deforestation and phase out fossil fuels.

Over the coming months, Corrêa plans to convene high-level meetings among global leaders, including fossil fuel producers and consumers, international organizations, industries, workers, scholars and advocacy groups.

For the road map to both be accepted and be useful, the process will need to address the global market issues of supply and demand, as well as equity. For example, in some fossil fuel-producing countries, oil, gas or coal revenues are the main source of income. What can the road ahead look like for those countries that will need to diversify their economies?

Nigeria is an interesting case study for weighing that question.

Oil exports consistently provide the bulk of Nigeria’s revenue, accounting for around 80% to over 90% of total government revenue and foreign exchange earnings. At the same time, roughly 39% of Nigeria’s population has no access to electricity, which is the highest proportion of people without electricity of any nation. And Nigeria possesses abundant renewable energy resources across the country, which are largely untapped: solar, hydro, geothermal and wind, providing new opportunities.

What a road map might look like

In Belém, representatives talked about creating a road map that would be science-based and aligned with the Paris climate agreement, and would include various pathways to achieve a just transition for fossil-fuel-dependent regions.

Some inspiration for helping fossil-fuel-producing countries transition to cleaner energy could come from Brazil and Norway.

In Brazil, Lula asked his ministries to prepare guidelines for developing a road map for gradually reducing Brazil’s dependency on fossil fuels and find a way to financially support the changes.

His decree specifically mentions creating an energy transition fund, which could be supported by government revenues from oil and gas exploration. While Brazil supports moving away from fossil fuels, it is also still a large oil producer and recently approved new exploratory drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River.

Norway, a major oil and gas producer, is establishing a formal transition commission to study and plan its economy’s shift away from fossil fuels, particularly focusing on how the workforce and the natural resources of Norway can be used more effectively to create new and different jobs.

Both countries are just getting started, but their work could help point the way for other countries and inform a global road map process.

The European Union has implemented a series of policies and laws aimed at reducing fossil fuel demand. It has a target for 42.5% of its energy to come from renewable sources by 2030. And its EU Emissions Trading System, which steadily reduces the emissions that companies can emit, will soon be expanded to cover housing and transportation. The Emissions Trading System already includes power generation, energy-intensive industry and civil aviation.

Fossil fuel and renewable energy growth ahead

In the U.S., the Trump administration has made clear through its policymaking and diplomacy that it is pursuing the opposite approach: to keep fossil fuels as the main energy source for decades to come.

The International Energy Agency still expects to see renewable energy grow faster than any other major energy source in all scenarios going forward, as renewable energy’s lower costs make it an attractive option in many countries. Globally, the agency expects investment in renewable energy in 2025 to be twice that of fossil fuels.

At the same time, however, fossil fuel investments are also rising with fast-growing energy demand.

The IEA’s World Energy Outlook described a surge in new funding for liquefied natural gas, or LNG, projects in 2025. It now expects a 50% increase in global LNG supply by 2030, about half of that from the U.S. However, the World Energy Outlook notes that “questions still linger about where all the new LNG will go” once it’s produced.

What to watch for

The Belém road map dialogue and how it balances countries’ needs will reflect on the world’s ability to handle climate change.

Corrêa plans to report on its progress at the next annual U.N. climate conference, COP31, in late 2026. The conference will be hosted by Turkey, but Australia, which supported the call for a road map, will be leading the negotiations.

With more time to discuss and prepare, COP31 may just bring a transition away from fossil fuels back into the global negotiations.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/709755/original/file-20251218-56-oxcot8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C464%2C5568%2C2784&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 10:59:39.445193

This can be attributed to innovative solar designs. For example, UCLA created ‘dark photovoltaics’ with a rare natural phenomenon. UCLA based its unique design on a forgotten idea dating back to 1821. Discover how innovative dark photovoltaics can transform the solar industry and potentially boost the global capacity even further!

UCLA revives a forgotten idea dating back to 1821

Now, dark photovoltaics may sound like an unfamiliar concept, but it is certainly far from it! In 1821, Thomas Seebeck created a pioneering device called the thermocouple. This device was quite the showstopper back in its day, and it measured temperatures through a concept which is known today as the Seebeck Effect.

In short, two different metal wire types are joined at their ends. These two wires then experience different temperatures, resulting in heat being converted into power. A device reads this generated voltage by using calibration data and changes it into a temperature reading.

Researchers from UCLA and Stanford University were inspired by the Seebeck Effect and thereby created their dark photovoltaics by using a rare natural phenomenon. The research team was led by UCLA’s Aaswath Raman, a materials science and engineering assistant professor. Their study was published in the scientific journal Joule in 2019. Additional study authors include Stanford’s Wei Li (post-doctoral scholar) and Shanhui Fan (electrical engineering professor).

Creating “dark photovoltaics” with a rare natural phenomenon

There have been significant breakthroughs in photovoltaics, such as the blackest-ever solar cell that produces record energy. Now, we could soon be generating solar energy even at night thanks to the researchers’ dark photovoltaics, which is driven by the rare natural phenomenon called radiative sky cooling.

According to Raman:

“This effect occurs naturally all the time, especially on clear nights. The result is that the object ejecting the heat, whether it’s a car, the ground, or a building, will be slightly cooler than the ambient temperature.”

Together, they engineered a straightforward device. The device was significantly cost-effective, as it reportedly cost the team under $30 to create it. What’s more, the device can potentially transform the solar technology industry.

This is how the prototype device works

The team painted an aluminum disk black on one side and placed the black side facing the sky. This disk radiates the surrounding air’s heat, which a thermoelectric generator converts into electricity thanks to the difference in temperature. According to their results, the prototype produced up to 25 milliwatts per square meter, which can power one LED light bulb.

Raman added that their device can be used produce electricity during the day and night, especially when integrated with existing solar technology installations. According to the International Energy Agency, over 1 billion people globally do not have reliable access to electricity. This would be a great stepping stone for people living and/or working in severely remote areas, as well as those without access to batteries.

Raman also believes their technology’s output could be enhanced as much as 20 times more than the current prototype by using advanced components. Their technology’s output will also be significantly higher in dry, hot climates that experience high levels of radiative sky cooling.

The team’s research proves that clean power production could soon become commercially feasible even during the dark hours. As they continue their research and development phase, one cannot help but become excited about the possibility of advancing renewable technologies even further and being one step closer to achieving zero carbon emissions. Other pioneering solar technology breakthroughs include the Apollo Panda solar panels that wrap around objects like Christmas wrapping paper.

The Public News Service Monday afternoon update, I'm Mike Clifford.

A day after the audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela, President Trump Sunday renewed his calls for an American ""takeover"" of the Danish territory of Greenland for the sake of U.S. security interests and threatened military action on Colombia for facilitating the global sale of cocaine, while his top diplomat declared, ""The Communist government in Cuba is in a lot of trouble.""

That's the take from CNN.

They report the comments from Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after the ouster of Venezuelan Nicolas Maduro, underscore that the U.S. administration is serious about taking a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere.

Meantime, as the new year rings in, more than 20 million Americans are facing much higher health insurance costs, including nearly 500,000 Michiganders enrolled in marketplace plans.

Healthcare advocates say insurance premiums are expected to double or even triple for some. comes after enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits expired at midnight on New Year's Eve.

Amber Bellazier is with the Michigan League for Public Policy.

She explains how these tax credits have served families in the state.

In terms of increasing access to affordable health coverage that really protects families financial security and helps to promote regular access to care, which we know ultimately improves healthy communities across the board.

Those in and Congress of support ending the credits say extending them would have added significant federal costs and argue that subsidies distorted the insurance market.

Crystal Blair reporting.

And employers in West Virginia and neighboring states continue to report trouble finding workers.

New data show hiring people have served their time after a criminal conviction known as second chance hiring can benefit both employers and communities.

Talisa Carter with the Urban Institute says many people are released from prison without proper identification and face housing challenges.

She says a focused resume can help level the playing field for candidates who are valuable to employers, but may not check all of the conventional boxes.

A resume that's skill-based really presents an opportunity for the formerly incarcerated to put their best foot forward in the workplace.

According to the Urban Institute, labor shortages are most common in the hospitality and retail trade industries.

And 10 most popular medications used largely by older adults will be on the average of 50 percent cheaper for most of Oregon's Medicare enrollees starting this year.

Stacey Larson is with AARP Oregon.

There are seniors who face very, very high out of pocket costs and often have to choose between utilities or their prescription drugs.

That situation is untenable.

Fortunately, some relief is in sight.

The change was part of the Inflation Reduction Act.

It requires Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices for common high-cost prescription drugs.

This is Public News Service.

Now that 2026 is underway, nearly 43 million Americans with student loans in default are expected to resume repayment.

Beginning this month, the U.S. Department of Education is sending notices that the administration's wage garnishment is restoring.

The action applies to federally held loans that have gone unpaid for at least 270 days.

The Education Data Initiative reports Georgia has roughly 1.7 million student loan borrowers with a total debt exceeding $70 billion.

Jack Wallace is director of government and lender relations at private loan company YRFI.

He says borrowers should act sooner rather than later.

We need to not put our head in the sand and pretend like this is going to go away.

So if you're getting an email from your servicer, which you should be, or getting an envelope by the U.S. Post Office from your service.

So you need to open it up and find out what's going on.

The Treasury Offset Program is the automated system the federal government would use to collect delinquent debts.

And a New York City bill designed to help renters was defeated in the 11th hour of the Eric Adams administration.

The Community Opportunity to Purchase Act allows vetted nonprofits the first opportunity to buy certain multifamily buildings when a landlord decides to sell them.

It comes as the city grapples with real estate companies buying buildings and letting affordable units fall into disrepair.

Elena Rodriguez with the New Economy Project says this last minute veto isn't the will of Adams' now former constituents.

New York City can't allow the actions of a lame duck mayor acting to appease powerful real estate interests to override the will of the city council and the communities it represents.

This veto is not only an attack on urgently needed housing policy, it directly undermines the council's role as a democratic institution.

Finally, almost 20 percent of people in Wisconsin use tobacco.

And for those who want to quit in the new year, keeping that commitment can be hard.

The group Truth Initiative has resources for folks who've decided to stay away from nicotine in 2026.

The second Friday of the year is sometimes called ""Quitter's Day"" because it's when people often backslide on their resolutions.

To counteract this, the nicotine prevention organization has launched ""You've Got This Day"" in its place.

Navajo Power is a Flagstaff-based public benefit corporation helping build utility-scale projects on tribal lands. Pratte, who co-founded the company, is also a Democrat vying for a spot on Arizona Corporation Commission.

Utilities have begun to rollback renewable initiatives voluntarily, according to Pratte, and “it’s all very political based — not upsetting who’s in power right now, regardless of what the economics bear out, and regardless of what the constituency wants.“

This market uncertainty is largely driven by federal decision-making, including grants being cancelled, like the EPA’s $7 billion Solar for All program, which would’ve helped power some 600 low-income homes on a reservation in northern Arizona.

While that sharpens the picture for the incentive at the federal level, scanning the national horizon in search of states pushing for their own OZ incentives is fuzzier.
States are going to want to build on that.” While Watkins and Fikri played their cards close to the vest as to which specific states, Fikri said some states are beginning to formulate long-term visions for their own OZ incentives.
Watkins noted Ohio is the only state with a sidecar OZ incentive.
“I hope that one day the incentive is so robust that states are beginning to add their own sidecar OZ incentives in ways that suit their respective needs, as Ohio has.”","When the One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law in July 2025, it made the opportunity zones (OZ) incentive a permanent part of the federal tax code. While that sharpens the picture for the incentive at the federal level, scanning the national horizon in search of states pushing for their own OZ incentives is fuzzier.

For many states, the urgent priority is the next round of OZ designations for what is being dubbed “OZ 2.0.” The process to nominate these areas begins July 1.

“Every state will be different, but that process is already getting underway,” said Jason Watkins, a partner in Novogradac’s Atlanta metro office and head of its OZ Working Group. “Everyone I have spoken with says that if and when states begin to pursue their own incentives, it’s a longer conversation that starts after these designations are made.”

Kenan Fikri, a senior fellow at the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a bipartisan public policy organization whose specialties include OZs, agreed.

“After designations are complete, we expect states to shift their attention to complementary strategies to unlock investment for priority places and use cases,” said Fikri. “We know [OZs are] powerful. They’ve done more for the housing supply than almost any other federal tool in decades. States are going to want to build on that.”

While Watkins and Fikri played their cards close to the vest as to which specific states, Fikri said some states are beginning to formulate long-term visions for their own OZ incentives. Fikri said interest in complementary incentives or tax credits may ultimately be determined by the fiscal situation, with states less inclined to advocate for their own incentives if their finances are not strong.

“If their fiscal situation starts to deteriorate in the coming years, I could see the need for revenue in the short term outweighing the intention to support investments in the long term,” said Fikri. “State finances are always a balance. I remain optimistic, but that could be a countervailing force against related OZ policy momentum.”

Data Shapes Decisions

Reporting requirements in OZ 2.0 will hopefully reveal greater information about OZ investments, said Leslie Lane, president at ACC Capital, a nonprofit based in Little Rock, Arkansas, that operates in multiple states in OZs. Lane is hopeful that additional data can help drive the application and interest of the federal incentive as well as improve the pitch for any potential, future

state-tier incentives.

“That’s the question is where are the dollars flowing into? That’s tough to answer because we don’t have a data source,” said Lane. “It’s not a good way to have that conversation because, while the federal government gets some of the data about this incentive, some of it doesn’t get shared to states. So, how many OZ deals are being done in a particular state or a particular census tract or geographic area, that’s a complicated answer to get today.”

Lane is hopeful that OZ reporting will mirror new markets tax credit reporting, which provides a database of location, asset type and more.

Due to the nature of the states’ legislative cycles, Lane agreed that the state-level work in OZs for the next six months is preparing to select new geographic zones for OZ 2.0.

“What we saw with the first wave was this was a new tool that people didn’t understand, so we were trying to get out into communities and help understand what it is,” said Lane. “The data will be coming. In terms of the state, one of the things is a timing issue. They’ve got to nominate (new zones) by a certain date and focus on that. Then they’ll have to have a legislative session. The state needs time to get to that next legislative session, then it will have the ability to have data to show what happened or not happened.”

Oh, Ohio

When it comes to state level policies, OZ experts have pointed to Ohio as a standout example. Watkins noted Ohio is the only state with a sidecar OZ incentive.

“Ohio has been the leader,” said Fikri. “I’m starting to hear more states talk about Ohio as an interesting model.”

Fikri said the way Ohio’s OZ incentive is structured, as an income tax incentive to encourage capital to invest locally, may appeal to states that consider bringing their own OZ financing programs online.

“Instead of a Cleveland-based investor investing in Dallas, they invest in Cleveland because of the extra incentive,” said Fikri. “Other states are attracted to that idea.”

Counterintuitively, Fikri said local sources of funding could sweeten the potential for national investors in a particular development or endeavor, as it would give more certainty to developing in a particular state or area.

“The Ohio model is to encourage Ohio investors to invest in Ohio projects. That’s the advantage,” said Fikri. “The goal is to make the returns more competitive, especially in a community where the appreciation potential is not the same as a large or fast-growing metro area.”

Hurdles to state-level incentives are the opportunity cost of the revenue as well as different capital gains tax regimes from state to state, said Fikri. Ohio, for example, offers an income tax incentive.

“Without the opportunity to conform, some might look at other income tax-based incentives or other direct contributions to projects,” said Fikri. “There are other ways states can engage at project or investor level.”

What OZs offer that other funding sources may not is scalability and unencumbered equity.

“OZ dollars can come in any size chunk,” said Fikri, saying $10,000 might be right for one development while hundreds of millions of dollars may suit another.

Further on Up the Road

Fikri hopes the next two years are a period of rising enthusiasm and creativity.

“I think that this is a critical moment of potential,” said Fikri. “We’re at a unique transition from beta to permanence. States really have the incentive to pay attention right now, learn from 1.0 and set themselves up for success. I hope we see a real flurry of policy innovation before the OZ incentive matures into something more familiar that states leave on auto pilot.”

As the incentive moves to implement reforms, Watkins and others are hopeful that after new designations for OZ 2.0 are affirmed that some of the longer-term goals, perhaps including state-level OZ incentives, can begin to take shape.

“The outlook for opportunity zones is as positive as it’s ever been,” said Watkins. “I hope that one day the incentive is so robust that states are beginning to add their own sidecar OZ incentives in ways that suit their respective needs, as Ohio has.”",https://www.novoco.com/static/images/favicon.4c5b39a4ae2a.ico,N,,2026-01-06 09:00:52.747477

Climate could also once again become a major issue at the Supreme Court in 2026, as the justices consider an oil industry bid to stop states, cities and counties nationwide from holding the fossil fuel industry financially accountable for rising global temperatures.

Beyond the courtroom, the administration is expected to soon finalize the rollback of a 2009 finding that underpins most climate rules, stoking debate over whether doing so will weaken an argument the oil industry has used to defend itself against liability lawsuits.

The legal fights come as the scope of climate litigation expanded in 2025. An Oregon woman accused the oil and gas industry of contributing to her mother’s death during a heat wave. Washington state homeowners filed a landmark lawsuit against oil majors arguing that climate change has caused more frequent and intense natural disasters, leading insurance premiums to rise.

“Climate litigation is evolving rapidly and is a symptom of the failure of governments everywhere to take meaningful action to address the threat,” said Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor at Vermont Law and Graduate School.

Still, the Trump administration is alone in “working overtime to prevent any of these cases from coming to trial,” Parenteau said.

“Other governments may oppose remedies being sought in some of the cases, but not they’re denying the reality of the threat or arguing that courts have no role whatsoever in adjudicating the issues,” said Parenteau, who has provided pro bono advice to a law firm bringing climate lawsuits in the U.S.

Here are five key climate issues that will play out in court in 2026:

1. DOJ battles states

The Department of Justice last spring sued four Democratic-led states, spurred by an executive order Trump signed in April instructing DOJ to target state laws the president says are “burdening” fossil fuel production.

DOJ’s lawsuits carry “potentially far‑reaching consequences for traditional energy companies,” the law firm Jones Day wrote in a recent note to clients.

Two of the lawsuits — against New York and Vermont — aim to invalidate state laws creating “climate Superfunds” that seek payment from energy producers for greenhouse gas emissions. If courts agree the state laws are barred by federal law, DOJ’s lawsuits could lead to a “de facto nationwide federal shield against state climate torts and ‘climate Superfund’ recovery schemes,” Jones Day attorneys wrote.

If New York and Vermont prevail, “traditional energy producers could face retroactive exposure untethered to federal permitting,” the law firm wrote.

“Either outcome,” Jones Day said, “will affect litigation risk and strategy across the energy value chain.”

DOJ’s lawsuits haven’t discouraged other states from considering their own climate Superfund laws. New Jersey lawmakers will discuss a proposed law in January, and Maryland has decided to investigate the possibility.

The Trump administration has also sued Hawaii and Michigan, seeking to block the states from joining their Democratic counterparts in launching lawsuits that ask the oil industry to foot the bill for climate impacts.

Hawaii has filed a climate liability lawsuit. Michigan has considered filing but has not yet started a case.

2. California climate disclosure

California’s first-in-the-nation climate disclosure laws had been set to take effect Jan. 1 before a federal appeals court in November pumped the brakes on one measure requiring major companies to report climate risks.

The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came just after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the Supreme Court to block the climate disclosure laws, arguing the appellate court had failed to act.

The 9th Circuit suspended SB 261 — which was scheduled to take effect in January — pending appeal. The law would require businesses with revenues of more than $500 million to disclose climate-related financial risks and measures taken to mitigate and adapt.

The court declined to stop enforcement of the second law — SB 253 — which takes effect in June. It would require corporations with at least $1 billion in revenue to report carbon emissions across their supply chains, along with emissions connected directly to their operations and energy purchases.

The sweep of California’s laws means they likely apply to most large companies across the United States, and they have drawn increased attention since the Trump administration withdrew a Biden-era climate disclosure rule advanced by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Oral arguments on the matter are scheduled for Jan. 9. The California Air Resources Board has said the Jan. 1 deadline is no longer in effect, but companies may voluntarily report.

Exxon Mobil in October filed its own lawsuit against California, arguing the state’s disclosure laws seek to embarrass large fossil fuel producers in the hope that they will be “shamed into curbing their emissions.” The state has filed a motion to dismiss.

3. Taxing tourists to pay for climate change

A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked Hawaii from imposing a tax on cruise ship passengers to offset the costs of climate change.

The 9th Circuit issued the block on Dec. 31, a week after a lower court rejected a request from the cruise industry and Trump administration to stop the first-in-the-nation fee from taking effect Jan. 1.

The cruise industry sued the state in August, seeking to halt its plans for an 11 percent surcharge on the gross fare paid by a cruise ship’s passengers.

The Trump administration got involved in November, calling Hawaii’s “green fee” a “scheme to extort American citizens and businesses.”

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bradley Craigmyle last month told Judge Jill Otake of the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii that the fee conflicts with federal law barring states from taxing vessels operating in U.S. waters. The state has said it is “confident in the legality” of its law.

The state will be able to increase fees on hotel room and vacation rentals, but the 9th Circuit stayed the cruise tax until it hears the case on an expedited schedule.

4. A Supreme Court battle royale

The nation’s highest bench will soon reveal whether it will take up the oil and gas industry’s latest effort to quash a swath of lawsuits seeking to hold companies financially accountable for the costs of climate change.

Exxon Mobil and Suncor Energy have asked the justices to find that federal law bars local governments from seeking relief for climate change in state courts. A decision to take up the case would be a significant — if preliminary — win for the companies, which have warned that the liability lawsuits could cost them billions of dollars.

It takes the vote of four justices to agree to hear a petition, a threshold most requests fail to achieve. The court rebuffed similar efforts twice in 2025 but did hand energy companies a narrow procedural win in the litigation in 2021.

The Trump administration has backed the oil companies’ petition, boosting its chance of being heard by the justices.

Oil industry lawyers have argued there is a “clear and acknowledged conflict” as to whether federal law precludes local governments from suing fossil fuel producers for the alleged effects of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Boulder, which sued the oil companies, has argued that states have always had the authority to police in-state injuries, pointing to similar lawsuits against the manufacturers of opioids and asbestos.

5. Endangering a key oil industry defense

Even as oil and gas producers challenge climate liability lawsuits at the Supreme Court, the industry has notched nearly a dozen wins against the local governments that are suing them, convincing judges the claims are preempted by the Clean Air Act.

But fossil fuel companies’ winning argument could be undercut by the Trump administration’s move to repeal the endangerment finding, the 2009 EPA decision that serves as the foundation for many federal climate regulations.

“It’s been their go-to, the one that has knocked the cases they’ve won out of court,” said Parenteau of Vermont Law and Graduate School.

The Sierra Club said in a recent report that repealing the Obama-era finding would expose polluters to “significant common-law liability” because EPA would no longer be authorized to address interstate greenhouse gas emissions.

Oil companies’ argument has been that a 2011 Supreme Court case — American Electric Power v. Connecticut — bars plaintiffs from suing climate polluters under federal common law because greenhouse gas emissions are regulated by the Clean Air Act.

“Repealing EPA’s authority to regulate climate pollution under the Clean Air Act would be a disastrous decision for many reasons,” and Andres Restrepo, a senior attorney at the Sierra Club, adding the environmental group “would explore all possible avenues — including but not limited to litigation — to hold polluters accountable in the absence of federal action.”

Donald Kochan, executive director of the Law & Economics Center at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, called the theory “wholly unpersuasive.” The Supreme Court, he said, will determine whether the Clean Air Act preempts legal challenges by looking at what Congress has authorized an agency to do — not by what an agency has chosen to do.

“Their argument is that if the federal government steps back, the states are allowed to step in,” Kochan said. “But the courts are looking at whether or not Congress has chosen to exercise its federal statutory authority in this space, not whether the executive agencies have chosen to act in this space.”

He said courts look to reach decisions “based on fixed law, not on the changing nature of executive discretion.”

Still, the uncertainty has put the industry on edge, said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at Bracewell who headed EPA’s air regulations office during the George W. Bush administration. Some of the larger trade associations, he said, have raised concerns about the proposal.

The Chamber of Commerce in its public comments on the endangerment finding repeal sought to reaffirm that the Clean Air Act would “continue to displace” federal common law claims regarding greenhouse gas emissions. It also asked EPA to note that state laws imposing climate liability are barred under federal law.

“I don’t want to overstate the industry’s concern,” Holmstead said. “They view it as something that may increase their litigation risk, but companies are also starting to weigh that against the uncertainty of having EPA regulations.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d8/db/7e8ed7184dcabd1e0a46f59b6a5b/fbi-officials-text-messages-20838.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 10:14:20.075390

“Introducing ‘sticks’ is essential to reach deep decarbonization goals in the long run.” The researchers were surprised by how effective incentives can be at accelerating the clean energy transition in the near term.","Newswise — A new study from a team of researchers that includes faculty from the University of California San Diego and Princeton University shows how a mix of subsidies for clean energy and taxes on pollution can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

While these kinds of policy mixes are widely used in the real world, the the study, published in Nature Climate Change is the first to show how the combination of such policies can be simulated in economic models that are the backbone of nearly all climate policy discussions – including the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil held Nov. 10-21.

The results reveal that financial incentives can spark rapid adoption of cleaner technologies in the near term, but without policies that also punish polluters it won’t be possible to stop climate change.

“This work helps make our climate models more realistic about how governments actually behave,” said the study’s coauthor David Victor, professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and co-director of UC San Diego’s Deep Decarbonization Initiative (D2I). “For years, models have told us what’s economically efficient — but not what’s politically possible. Our goal is to bridge that gap so policymakers can craft strategies that survive real-world politics.”

The research provides a rigorous, data-driven look at how policy design and political timing affect the nation’s ability to decarbonize its energy system.

A study arriving at a critical moment

The study comes out at a pivotal time for U.S. and global climate policy. The transition to a new U.S. administration in 2025 has cast uncertainty on many clean energy incentives enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). At the same time, the federal government has never implemented a meaningful tax on warming pollution, although some states have adopted small tax-like policies.

“In the United States, we are removing the reward policies designed to accelerate decarbonization and it's unlikely this administration will introduce any policies that punish larger emitters,” Victor said. “ Meanwhile, other countries are taking different paths — China is adding new incentives and some penalties and Europe is leaning heavily on policies that make emissions more expensive. You’re seeing a global experiment in real time.”

He notes that the paper, while focussing on the U.S., can serve as a “road test” for other nations around the world about which mix of policies will have the biggest impacts reducing fossil fuels.

Testing policy sequences: rewards, penalties and political timing

The paper’s modeling also explores what happens when climate policies are added, delayed, or repealed over time. To test how such policy choices shape long-term progress, Victor and coauthors used a multisector, state-level energy systems model (GCAM-USA) to simulate how different approaches affect emissions, technology costs and clean energy adoption across all 50 U.S. states through 2050.

Using real data from federal and state programs, the researchers compared scenarios such as:

Incentives only — Long-term subsidies that make renewable energy and electric vehicles more affordable.

Penalties only — Economy-wide carbon pricing that makes fossil fuels more expensive.

Combined approaches — Starting with incentives, followed by penalties after 10 or 20 years.

Inconsistent policies — Reflecting political instability, with incentives that start, stop and restart over time.

In simpler terms, the researchers created a set of “what-if” policy simulations. Using the ""carrot and stick"" metaphor that refers to the set of policies of rewards and punishments to encourage decarbonization, the authors describe what happens in a world with “no stick, more carrot,” versus “more stick, less carrot,” or policies that change mid-course.

“As ‘carrots’ make it cheaper for companies and consumers to adopt green technologies, those technologies see greater uptake,” they write. “Introducing ‘sticks’ is essential to reach deep decarbonization goals in the long run.”

The researchers were surprised by how effective incentives can be at accelerating the clean energy transition in the near term. These policies include tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable power, government grants and loans for clean manufacturing and rebates that help homeowners install heat pumps, rooftop solar panels and energy-saving upgrades.

Consistency will make energy greener and cheaper in the long run

The study also finds that political consistency — keeping incentive programs stable and reliable — is just as important as the size of the subsidies or the stringency of future penalties. When incentives are applied consistently, the researchers found the economy can reach an 80% reduction in energy-related carbon emissions by mid-century. When those incentives are withdrawn or delayed, investment slows and later emissions cuts become more expensive.

“When policy is unpredictable, companies delay investment,” Victor said. “That delay can make it politically and economically harder to act later.”

Bringing political realism — and durability — into climate models

Victor describes the study as part of a broader research agenda at UC San Diego’s Deep Decarbonization Initiative to make climate models more attuned to real-world politics and human behavior. This extension of the initiative involves scholars from around the country, many of whom served as coauthors on this paper.

“For years, analysts and reality have been drifting apart,” he said. “This work is part of a larger mission to make studies of climate policy much more realistic about what happens in the real world — how government policies affect investments and emissions.”

The authors hope the research can be used as a guide for key decision makers around the globe. They conclude, “Understanding what works — and when — is key to reaching global climate goals.”

Reduced access to critical climate data In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers, and consumers to get data.
That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.
“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.
Hindered federal climate risk regulation Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social, and governance stance.","(Yale Climate Connections ) – Property insurance rates have spiked since 2021 due to the increasing frequency of climate-related natural disasters, inflation in the cost of building materials and supply chain issues. The typical homeowner saw an average increase of $648 in their annual premium from 2021 to 2024. And those rates are expected to increase by an average of 8% nationwide this year — with homeowners in some states facing much higher increases, such as a projected 27% hike in Louisiana.

An increasing number of American homeowners are linking those increases to climate change. A majority of them (72%) say that natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires exacerbated by climate change are somewhat or very responsible for the rise in homeowner insurance costs, according to a poll by Data For Progress.

There is a bipartisan consensus that prices are rising too fast — nearly 80% of homeowners in Texas, for instance, want to see rates reduced, and one-third of Florida homeowners say that rate increases are the most important issue for them (even ahead of inflation and housing costs) — though Americans are torn on the role of climate change.

Insurance companies are regulated on the state level, and there have been heated debates in states as diverse as Idaho, Minnesota, Louisiana and Colorado about policies and regulations to slow the increase in rates. In Iowa, which was expected to see a 19% increase in home insurance rates this year, nearly 180 researchers and educators signed a statement calling attention to the role of climate change in driving up insurance costs — and calling for better building standards and a faster transition to more renewable energy sources in the state, such as solar and wind.

The federal government plays a role in all this through its funding of programs to share the risk of losses such as the National Flood Insurance Program and disaster relief efforts. It also provides access to climate data used by insurers to foresee potential risks and formulate rates.

The Trump administration’s policies on climate, cutting funding to key programs, reducing access to and limiting the collection of climate data, and slashing the ranks of federal regulators are contributing to an increase in property insurance rates for homeowners, said insurance industry analysts and experts.

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.

Asked about the Trump administration’s plans to help reduce property insurance rates, a White House spokesperson declined to speak on the record, but provided Capital & Main with a statement from an unnamed official:

“More people are living in Florida than ever before, which naturally causes an increase in rates,” the statement said. “It’s inaccurate and silly to pin this on climate change. The Administration is working to lower costs across all industries for Americans.”

Tariffs

The steep tariffs on materials like lumber, steel, and aluminum are raising construction and repair costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers through higher home insurance premiums. First, insurance coverage limits “may no longer provide enough protection as the cost of materials and labor needed to rebuild your home increases,” noted Wawanesa Insurance in a blogpost. “Second, repair costs following claims will be higher, potentially influencing future premium rates.”

The main insurance industry trade group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, has been actively lobbying against tariffs because of their impact on home insurance.

Cuts to disaster relief funding and resiliency programs

The administration has cut disaster relief funds at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are given to local governments and states following natural disasters. The money is used to repair or reconstruct homes and finance housing. Without those resources, communities devastated by such catastrophes won’t be able to rebuild homes and infrastructure in more resilient ways, “and these communities will pay higher insurance premiums as a result,” writes DeLong, the Consumer Federation advocacy associate, and Ethan Weiland, another CFA research associate.

In April, the Federal Emergency Management Agency terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, which provided grants to states and communities to fund projects that reduce the risk of damage from flooding, tornadoes, and other natural disasters. Ending the program “means terminating mitigation projects that would have saved lives, lowered the risk of property loss, and reduced homeowner, farm, and business property insurance premiums,” DeLong and Weiland noted.

Reduced access to critical climate data

In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers, and consumers to get data.

One of the reports, which was uploaded by the Consumer Federation of America, on rising homeowners insurance costs from 2018 to 2022, showed how this increase outpaced the rate of inflation and that policy nonrenewal rates were higher in areas with higher-than-expected losses from climate-related disasters.

“We need reliable, long datasets,” said Kieran Bhatia, head of climate and sustainability for North America at the global reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. “Without them, you basically are kind of putting your finger up to the wind a little bit about what is a realistic [extreme weather] event.”

Bhatia and other climate risk specialists expressed their concerns during a panel discussion during New York Climate Week in September.

“If you want to promote economic growth, the best way to do that is to have good information,” said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress. “Capitalism relies on good information to make an efficient economy, and insurers are subject to that rule as well. But now no one has this essential climate information.”

Rollback of renewable energy initiatives

The administration’s rollback of renewable energy initiatives — such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All initiative — has directly impacted the underwriting market for clean energy projects. That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.

And President Donald Trump’s executive orders to block state and local climate change measures — such as those that seek to limit carbon emissions or require oil and gas companies to pay for climate damage — could escalate future litigation risk for insurers as climate change worsens.

“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.

Hindered federal climate risk regulation

Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social, and governance stance.

By reducing federal oversight, the administration is downplaying climate-related financial risks. This leaves property and financial markets more exposed and increases the instability that can be caused by higher costs and limited insurance availability.

Approval of new fossil fuel projects

The administration’s strong push to increase oil and gas production, such as approving six new liquefied natural gas terminals along the Gulf Coast, will likely accelerate the pace of climate change and lead to higher insurance premiums, said Ethan Nuss, senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network.

“The Trump administration’s fast-tracking of dirty energy mega-projects — like the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG (CP2) methane export terminal — increases the risk exposure of both insurers and neighboring communities that will be stuck paying out larger claims and skyrocketing premiums or be forced out of their ‘uninsurable’ homes.”

Changes to the TSCA fee structure are generally done via rulemaking by the EPA, says Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy at the Environmental Defense Fund.
But some chemical industry members and lawyers point to the fee structure renewal as a chance to make broader changes to TSCA.
Doa calls the expiration of the fee authority “a Trojan horse” for the chemical industry.
Congress is working on TSCA update bills Some members of Congress agree with the ACC that it’s time to update TSCA again.","The year 2026 will be a big one for the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the major US law that covers the manufacture, import, and use of chemicals that may cause harm to humans and the environment. Congress gave TSCA a big overhaul in 2016; 10 years later, parts of it are up for renewal. Industry says it’s time for another significant makeover, but environmental advocates have doubts.

One important provision of TSCA that will expire on Sept. 30 is the one allowing the EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers and importers. This fee authority helps cover the law’s implementation costs, such as testing and performing risk evaluations.

Changes to the TSCA fee structure are generally done via rulemaking by the EPA, says Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy at the Environmental Defense Fund. “Fees can be renewed through a simple process that wouldn’t require reopening the statute at all,” she tells C&EN by email.

But some chemical industry members and lawyers point to the fee structure renewal as a chance to make broader changes to TSCA. Telly Lovelace, director of issues communications at the American Chemistry Council (ACC), says that Congress needs to address “structural issues in the program that have become increasingly evident since implementation began.”

The “structural issues” include the new chemicals review process, how the EPA prioritizes which chemicals to review, and transparency regarding its decision-making process on chemicals. Reforms in these areas “would help TSCA function as Congress intended, to protect public health and the environment while enabling American innovation and manufacturing competitiveness,” Lovelace says.

Doa calls the expiration of the fee authority “a Trojan horse” for the chemical industry. “And inside that horse will be rollbacks to the essential protections that keep Americans safe from the worst toxic chemicals,” she says.

During a Jan. 22, 2025 congressional hearing, Doa addressed some of the ACC’s criticisms about TSCA, including the slowness of chemical reviews. She said that many of the delays in the EPA’s approval process were due to companies failing to provide sufficient and timely data on exposure and toxicity.

Congress is working on TSCA update bills

Some members of Congress agree with the ACC that it’s time to update TSCA again.

Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), has expressed frustration with the slow review process for new chemicals on multiple occasions.

Members of both the House and the Senate say they’re working on bills to make changes to TSCA. During an Oct. 8 confirmation hearing for Douglas Troutman to lead the EPA’s chemicals office, Capito said that the EPW was working on bipartisan legislation. C&EN reached out to both Republicans and Democrats on the committee, but no one on either side agreed to comment on the record about their plans for new TSCA legislation in 2026 by the time of this publication.

Asked if the ACC is working with members in Congress to draft a reform bill, Lovelace says the council engages with Congress and staff regularly to share technical expertise and experience on TSCA. “That said, legislative proposals are developed by lawmakers, and we are not in a position to comment on the timing, authorship, or specific contents of any potential bill that has not yet been introduced.”","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/WCO-TSCA---287304:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2026-01-06 06:57:57.955823

This announcement, which represents a major step forward, confirms the US government's support for the group's project to deploy an enrichment plant on the site at Oak Ridge (Tennessee). Orano is now able to address the next steps of the project, in particular, a finalization of the contract and the filing of a license application with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in HY1 of 2026.

The project, known as IKE*, will help provide a new source for reliable and secure procurement of enriched uranium in the USA. It will allow the needs of operators of nuclear reactors in the USA to be secured in accordance with US regulations prohibiting the import of Russian uranium as of 2028. The new plant will also meet the growing needs of US energy utilities in the context of demand driven by artificial intelligence and data centers which require a stable, low-cost and low-carbon source of electricity.

The IKE project in the United States will complement the extension to the capacities of the Georges Besse 2 enrichment plant currently under construction in France, as Orano's first response to meeting Western energy needs. For more than 40 years, Orano's plants on the Tricastin site (Drôme and Vaucluse, France) have been supplying the world's nuclear fleet with low-carbon energy thanks to their ultra-centrifugation technology, recognized for its reliability and its low environmental impact.

Nicolas Maes, Chief Executive Officer of Orano, commented ""This is excellent news for Orano and a decisive step forward on our project for an enrichment plant in the USA! This recognition by the US authorities is an illustration of the confidence they have in our expertise and our capacity to deploy our technology to ensure robust security of supply to our customers.""

François Lurin, Senior Executive Vice President of Orano's Chemistry-Enrichment Business Unit, added ""We are very proud to have been selected by the US Department of Energy, as a mark of confidence in the know-how of our teams. We are very eager to start writing what will be a new chapter in Orano's history with this new industrial facility on US soil, as we continue to deploy the project currently underway to extend the capacity of our French enrichment plant on the Tricastin site by 30%. This forward-looking project represents a major investment for the Orano group. We are keen to set the next steps in the process in motion and look forward to commencing production by the start of the next decade.""

While these changes will impact the country as a whole, the effect here in Indiana could be particularly acute, environmentalists say.

The changes apply to a number of industries, including automotive, power plants and coal and gas.

The Trump administration has steered the federal agency tasked with protecting human health and the environment in an unusual direction over the last 12 months: The Environmental Protection Agency has deregulated and delayed swaths of industrial rules designed to protect the environment and human health, reversed course on climate policy and axed much of its own research arm.

The effect on Indiana will be acute, environmental advocates say. Environmental advocates say they are concerned many of the EPA’s rollbacks will jeopardize the health of Hoosiers who live in a state that already has a precarious relationship with environmental health. Many of the state's largest polluters such as coal plants, chemical factories and steel mills have received exemptions from the federal government this year.

In a U.S. News report earlier this year, Indiana ranked dead last in the ""natural environment"" category, which ranks states based on air and water quality as well as pollution threats. The report cited the state’s nearly 3,000 pounds of industrial toxins per square mile — the national average is closer to 900.

The state also has an above average number of polluted waterways and more coal ash ponds — small, toxic water bodies near coal plants where poisonous refuse is discarded — than any other state.

On March 12, 2025, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced the rollback of 31 different policies, calling regulations like those designed to regulate hazardous air pollutants “suffocating.”

""Today, the green new scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success,” Zeldin said in a press video. “President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living. We at EPA will do our part to power the great American comeback.”

Zeldin’s positioning the EPA to lower the cost of fossil fuel production and promote industry is a new look for the agency that has historically been tasked with protecting environmental health. And as the federal agency rolls back and deregulates one policy at a time, scientists say it's difficult to get the complete picture of the impact on human and environmental health outcomes, making it trickier to fight back.

“The strategy is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts kind of approach,” said Gabriel Filippelli, a biochemist and the executive director of the Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute.

By sawing off small policies here and big policies there, he said, the EPA is minimizing the appearance of the environmental regulation overhaul, but the intent is “actually a very, very concerted plan to eliminate all of them.”

Fighting such changes in court also becomes more difficult, he said.

“You can’t just have one lawsuit, you are actually having to fight against 20 different policy changes at the same time,” Filippelli said. “It just overwhelms the ability of the normal checks and balances.”

The EPA has the ability to repeal and amend its own regulations. It's this process that local environmental advocates are worried about.

Here are some of the EPA's changes from the last year that could have the greatest impact on Indiana.

Unraveling climate change policies

In late July, Zeldin and U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced perhaps the most consequential of EPA rollbacks.

Speaking at an Indianapolis auto dealership alongside Gov. Mike Braun and Indiana Energy Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski, Zeldin said he intended to repeal air pollution guidance. This so-called ""endangerment finding"" has set the stage for greenhouse gas standards and regulations since 2009.

Zeldin said that if the finding successfully makes it through the agency's repeal process and is revoked, it would “be the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

After a years-long legal battle ending at the Supreme Court, the endangerment finding gave the EPA the authority to manage six greenhouse gases as threats to human health. The finding led to several regulations on vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas industry — policies Zeldin said he would also like to undo.

Repealing this could exacerbate the negative effects of climate change, endanger public health and potentially slow the economy, local environmental advocates told IndyStar in July.

Rep. Sue Errington, D-Muncie, the ranking minority member of the House Environmental Affair Committee, said that summers in Indiana are already “hotter, longer and more dangerous than they were a decade ago."" Eliminating greenhouse gas standards, she added, will accelerate climate change and harm public health.

The EPA has also proposed eliminating the ""burdensome"" Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, enacted in 2008. In a Sept. 12 news release, the agency said that clawing back the program would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs.

The program requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers across the United States to record and submit their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA each year. The EPA proposed to remove all of these requirements.

Janet McCabe, a former EPA deputy under President Joe Biden and current visiting professor at Indiana University, recognized it might not seem like eliminating a recording program would increase emissions. But, McCabe said, it actually does.

""Reporting programs are often the first step to people recognizing what they emit, how much they emit, and realizing that there are ways that they can emit less,"" she said. ""It's very well in ingrained into how people do business, and it's hugely helpful to the country understanding and the industries themselves understanding and the public understanding where we are in terms of emissions.""

Delays, delays, delays

The EPA under Biden worked to reduce pollution across the United States with a series of regulations, but over the past year Trump's EPA has given companies more time to comply with those policies.

In some of these cases, McCabe said, it seems like the EPA is giving companies extensions to meet pollution standards because they plan to eventually rescind the Biden-era rules.

""He's telling industry, 'You don't need to comply with this because we're going to change it anyway,'"" she said.

In Gary, Indiana, this delay means that residents living near the steel industry will continue to deal with dirty air.

In August the EPA issued interim final rules to delay complying with the previous administration’s pollution standards until 2027. Interim rules are typically used to address natural disasters or public health emergencies, not to provide industry with more time to comply.

The EPA issued a report saying the timeline the Biden Administration had set was too short and would cost too much for the industry.

The delay could have long-term health impacts, especially for young children who live near these polluters, Annie Fox, a law clerk with the Clean Air Council, told IndyStar in September. Clean Air Council is one of many environmental organizations suing the EPA over the interim rules.

The Biden EPA also updated a series of hazardous air pollution rules for multiple manufacturing sectors, giving facilities a deadline to meet compliance. This year, Trump issued a series of executive orders, giving these facilities ""regulatory relief"" by extending the deadlines in an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on “foreign control over materials critical to national resilience.” The targeted industries include energy, national defense, agriculture and health care.

Two Indiana facilities received extensions: the chemical manufacturing plant SABIC Innovative Plastics in Mount Vernon and Cook Medical's medical equipment sterilization facility in Ellettsville. EPA previously listed both plants as high-risk to human health after considering the amount of chemicals released on site.

Cuts to EPA affect Indiana

In May President Donald Trump announced his intention to cut the EPA budget by 55%. Later that month Zeldin announced further agency budget reductions, totaling $300 million.

Zeldin said in a written statement in July that the cuts would save the U.S. $748.8 million and help the EPA become “responsible stewards of [American’s] hard-earned tax dollars.”

One $130 million program on the chopping block called Solar for All aimed to help nearly 7,000 low-income Hoosiers lower electric bills and reduce their homes’ reliance on fossil fuels for energy.

Indiana’s program director for Solar United Neighbor Zach Schalk called the cut a “huge gut punch” in an August IndyStar interview.

In a written statement Zeldin said spending money on programs such as Solar for All were like “throwing gold bars off the Titanic” and the EPA under him and Trump would not condone “frivolous spending in the name of ‘climate equity.’”

Hoosiers adapt to changing priorities

In November, the EPA announced plans to redefine ""Waters of the United States"", which could leave Indiana's dwindling wetland habitats with even fewer protections. The EPA is also greenlighting pesticides that contain chemicals environmental advocates worry contain PFAS, commonly known as ""forever chemicals."" In addition, the agency is trying to loosen regulations that control heavy metal emissions, like mercury, from some coal and oil-fired electric plants, and has begun to remove the term climate change from certain webpages.

Filippelli said he's concerned about the future of health and the environment in Indiana and the country oversall.

""We already have a lot of environmental burdens,"" Filippelli said, referencing the state's poor air quality and the high number of Superfund sites across the state. ""All of that just leads us to be particularly vulnerable when they start relaxing some of these protections that have been very hard fought.""

Despite the federal government's disinvestment in renewable energy and environmental protections this year, Filippelli said he still hears from communities across Indiana who have an appetite for a clean, healthier future; many Hoosiers still want an electric vehicle or solar on their property. Funding is often the issue.

Filippelli said people are finding clever ways to navigate state level funding and local philanthropies will still finance some projects, but much of the Biden-era federal funding for such initiatives is gone.

""Certainly these transitions that people were hoping to see happen really quickly are much slower now, there's no greenwashing that. We're stepping backwards,"" Filippelli said. ""But community appetite is still there and we are committed to serving that appetite with good solutions.""

Southwest Power Pool files interconnection agreement with FERC

The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) has taken formal steps to add a large utility-scale solar project near the Oklahoma–Texas border to its regional transmission grid.

SPP recently filed a Generator Interconnection Agreement (GIA) with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allow Rabbit’s Foot Solar, LLC to connect to the SPP system, with Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) designated as the transmission owner.

The proposed Rabbit’s Foot Solar project would be built in Bowie County, Texas, immediately adjacent to southeast Oklahoma, placing it near the edge of SPP’s 14-state footprint.

RWE plans 298-MW solar facility in Bowie County

Rabbit’s Foot Solar is a 298-megawatt (MW) project being developed by RWE Clean Energy, one of the largest renewable developers operating in the United States.

According to RWE, the solar farm is designed to generate enough electricity to power more than 55,000 homes annually. Construction is expected to begin soon, with commercial operations targeted for 2027.

RWE described the project as being in advanced stages of development and a key component of its long-term growth strategy in the U.S. renewable market.

Rabbit’s Foot Solar is designed to deliver home-grown, reliable American energy, while supporting economic development in Bowie County and across the region, the company said.

Why SPP is involved in a Texas solar project

While most of Texas operates within the ERCOT grid, SPP maintains a limited but strategic footprint in northeast Texas, including Bowie County. SPP primarily serves states across the central U.S. within the Eastern Interconnection, managing high-voltage transmission and wholesale power markets.

SPP explained in its filing that the Rabbit’s Foot GIA includes provisions that do not fully conform to the organization’s Open Access Transmission Tariff, requiring FERC approval before the project can proceed.

SPP’s request underscores the growing complexity of grid planning as renewable projects expand near interconnection boundaries.

Oklahoma solar pipeline grows rapidly

That might not be a problem given the current bipartisan enthusiasm for nuclear energy, but that good will could evaporate if the industry again falters.
GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy has plans to build several smaller reactors starting in Ontario.","Once a home of the Manhattan Project, the fields surrounded by forested valleys and rolling hills in Oak Ridge, Tenn., could soon yield another nuclear first.

Concrete foundations and pilings are rising here for what is expected to be one of the first of a new generation of nuclear power plants, known as small modular reactors. The company behind it, Kairos Energy, has been developing its technology for almost a decade and is now deep in the throes of construction.

Many companies are racing to build reactors that experts say could, over time, be cheaper than the kind of large nuclear power plants that have been in use for decades. To hear corporate executives and government officials tell it, the world is at the dawn of a new nuclear age that will provide cheap energy and satiate artificial intelligence technology’s staggering appetite for electricity.

At the center of this promise is the idea of shrinking the vessels where nuclear reactions heat water to produce steam used to spin turbines. The components of these smaller reactors, the thinking goes, can be mass-produced and assembled more easily than conventional designs built by a small army of highly skilled workers.

The nuclear power industry has long struggled to complete projects. Almost all U.S. nuclear power plants in operation started generating power decades ago, most before Bill Clinton became president. In recent decades, steep costs and long delays, coupled with concerns about safety, have stymied nuclear energy.

“I think a lot of people recognize the value of what nuclear can bring but are still a little bit nervous about whether it can actually be done,” said Mike Laufer, co-founder and chief executive of Kairos Energy, which is based in the San Francisco Bay Area. “Credibility can be very hard to earn, but it can be lost very quickly.”

The United States has more nuclear power reactors than any country, but it badly trails in building new ones. In the last decade China has built more than three dozen reactors while the United States completed just two. Those two, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant near Augusta, Ga., came years late and cost $35 billion — about three times the original estimates.

President Trump wants new reactors to be a signature achievement of his term. His Energy Department has awarded $800 million for new reactor technologies and $1 billion in loan guarantees to restart the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania. The government is expected to offer billions more.

During a recent visit to the Idaho National Laboratory, Mr. Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, blamed regulatory hurdles for helping stifle the growth of nuclear energy. He said the creation of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission almost 50 years ago had led to excessive bureaucracy.

“Since that date, we have permitted, constructed and brought online two reactors,” Mr. Wright said.

Some experts, however, contend the main problem is an industry that has repeatedly struggled to deliver. The hurdles facing advanced reactors are even bigger, the experts say, because they are novel and some require a new kind of uranium fuel that the industry has only limited experience with.

New reactors will also require significant financial investment and federal aid. That might not be a problem given the current bipartisan enthusiasm for nuclear energy, but that good will could evaporate if the industry again falters.

“Once again it’s the bright shiny object,” said Peter Bradford, a former commissioner on the N.R.C. and a longtime critic of the high costs and delays that characterize new types of reactors. To be successful, a new design should be able to compete with other types of energy, he added. “Nuclear has just never been able to do that.”

The Race to Lower Costs

Nine years ago, the three founders of Kairos Energy began developing their designs, pinning their hopes on a new approach. The three men all studied nuclear and mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where J. Robert Oppenheimer, the leader of the Manhattan Project, once taught.

Kairos executives said they had opted to test each phase of the plant’s development as it progressed, rather than take the approach more common in this line of work: Design, construct and hope for the best.

Unlike conventional nuclear plants, Kairos’s reactor will not have large, domed buildings made of concrete and metal. And steam will not billow from huge water towers. Instead of water, the Kairos reactor will heat salt.

The reactor will rise a bit over about 32 feet. The full commercial design includes two reactor buildings and a turbine with an overall footprint of 60 acres.

The company, which has 540 full-time employees, designs and produces its own components. It makes many of the parts in Albuquerque, about 60 miles from Los Alamos, the ultimate headquarters of the Manhattan Project.

NuScale, a company that was once expected to deliver the first small reactor, in November 2023 had to cancel a project in Idaho after utilities pulled out of agreements to buy electricity from it because costs had risen too much.

The company said its technology was now advancing through a partnership with ENTRA1 Energy, an owner and developer of power plants. In September, the two companies and the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal government owned power company, announced plans to develop nuclear reactors. The first NuScale units will be built in Oak Ridge and could deliver power by 2030, the company said.

Other companies are pursuing similar projects.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy has plans to build several smaller reactors starting in Ontario. TerraPower, a company backed by Bill Gates, is building a reactor in Wyoming.

Radiant Energy Group, a start-up, says it is set to build this year a portable, micro reactor that will produce enough electricity to power 1,000 homes. Such devices are for special uses like providing energy to data centers or the military.

“If you don’t need a grid connection, we’re a great solution,” said Ray Wert, a company spokesman.

Like Kairos, Radiant plans to manufacture its reactors in Oak Ridge, home to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the Energy Department’s 17 national laboratories.

Big Backers and a New Fuel

At its site in Oak Ridge, Kairos is working on a test reactor expected to be complete in 2028; a demonstration unit, capable of producing electricity, is aimed for 2030. The company has a contract to supply 500 megawatts of energy capacity — about half the capacity of the typical large-scale nuclear plant — to Google by 2035.

Google’s involvement could make a huge difference. Technology companies investing in A.I. bring the kinds of money and interest that were missing in the early 2000s when delays and soaring costs last scuppered ambitions for a nuclear renaissance.

Kairos declined to say how much its plant would cost. But the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit research organization, estimated in 2023 that NuScale’s canceled Idaho project, which would have been roughly the same size as the one Kairos is building, would cost about $9.3 billion.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/29/multimedia/00biz-kairos-nuclear-01-lgjb/00biz-kairos-nuclear-01-lgjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:13:22.766478

After years of incremental improvements and proof-of-concept products, we're finally entering an era where next-generation technologies can and will reach commercial scale, geopolitical realities will reshape our supply chains, and the economics of manufacturing will fundamentally be transformed.

The decisions made in 2026 will determine which companies, regions, and technologies will dominate the next decade of energy storage. Having worked at the forefront of silicon battery development for the past two decades, I see five critical trends that will define the year ahead and set the trajectory for the industry's future.

The silicon battery breakthrough

2026 will see the first large-scale deployment of silicon batteries in EVs. This breakthrough will accelerate awareness of the fundamental cost and performance advantages of silicon over traditional lithium-ion chemistry, resulting in end users demanding silicon-level performance across all applications.

The great battery performance arms race

In 2026, increasing awareness of silicon battery performance will trigger what I call ""The Great Battery Performance Arms Race,"" where consumer electronics and EV manufacturers will begin to compete on fundamental battery performance. Energy density will dominate the near-term CE discussions, while extreme fast charging will drive the most radical innovation. Although charge anxiety is not typically associated with CE applications, the prospect of ""flash charging"" a device—think earbuds, phones, toys—to 100% in a few minutes will change both device design and how we use them. EV innovation will be all about charging. While broad adoption will only begin in 2026, the industry will recognize that fast charging will enable smaller, cheaper batteries and eliminate range anxiety. EVs are starting to all look and perform alike. The most aggressive EV adopters of silicon will win significant market share over the next 3-5 years.

Regional battery manufacturing strategies will crystallize

The politics of the past year have continued to undermine dependencies on global supply chains. Strategic industries, especially those affecting economic security, will move more aggressively toward domestic production. It's become clear that Asian manufacturers prefer Asian suppliers while American and European manufacturers seek their own local partnerships. Localized battery production trends will be rejuvenated as policy leaders recognize the catastrophic economic threat from dependence on foreign battery technology. Trade policy uncertainties have accelerated this trend beyond simple tariff considerations into fundamental supply chain architecture.

Asia becomes the de facto leader in battery innovation

While domestic battery production will get more attention in 2026, localized battery innovation will lose ground to the massive battery R&D investments in China. Historically, the U.S. has been a leader in battery innovation, but that position is slipping rapidly. While Western markets remain mired in policy debates and deprioritize EV commitments at the federal level, Chinese companies will continue advancing at speeds that Western competitors cannot match, creating a definitive innovation gap. Western hesitation to maintain aggressive R&D investment will help cement Asia's position as the center of battery technology development.

Capital markets drive manufacturing finance evolution

2026 will force battery manufacturers to move beyond traditional equity funding toward project finance and industrial-scale investment structures. Traditional venture capital cannot support the massive infrastructure requirements of domestic battery manufacturing at scale. Companies with proven unit economics and operational factories will access debt markets and specialized industrial financing, marking the industry's transition from startup funding models to heavy industry capital structures.

Silicon emerges as essential infrastructure for data centers

Data center energy consumption is poised to reach critical capacity constraints. Next year will thrust the world into a high-stakes sprint for radically better energy storage. The near-instantaneous power response required by AI-enabled servers overwhelms traditional Li-ion technology. The extreme fast discharge feature of silicon batteries is the solution, and in 2026 we will start to see silicon batteries emerge as a critical component of the infrastructure that’s needed to power AI-enabled data centers. While it’s going to take some time for us to see them used in full production deployments, there will be pilot projects and programs that utilize silicon batteries to meet these demands, marking an inflection point for the industry as a whole.

Lucid reported record vehicle production in 2025, despite the challenging environment for EVs.

The company cranked out 18,378 vehicles last year, about twice as many as it did in 2024.

Production and deliveries grew in Q4 too, despite the end of the U.S. EV tax credit.

Lucid Motors reported record fourth-quarter and full-year production numbers on Monday, indicating solid growth amid a tough environment for electric vehicles.

Lucid produced 8,412 vehicles in Q4, a 116% jump over Q3. It delivered 5,345 EVs during that period, a 31% increase over Q3. That's despite the end of U.S. EV tax credits in September, which sent America's electric car sales sinking.

For the full year, the startup produced 18,378 vehicles, just over double the 9,029 units it cranked out in 2024. Full-year deliveries came in at 15,841 vehicles.

While Lucid remains a small player in the EV space overall, that strong growth—especially toward the end of the year—could mean that Lucid has made headway on the manufacturing bottlenecks that initially stunted output of the new Gravity SUV.

Lucid doesn't break out its numbers between the Air sedan and Gravity, so that's not clear yet.

Lucid met its revised annual production goal of around 18,000 cars, but fell short of the 20,000-unit target it set early in 2025. In part, that's because production of the Gravity has gotten off to a slow start.

In August, Interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said the company is ""not where we want to be"" when it came to Gravity production. He called out supply chain hiccups like the export ban of permanent-magnet motors from China, but said he expected production to accelerate through the end of the year.

The three-row SUV is supposed to be Lucid's volume seller until a more compact, $48,000 Tesla Model Y rival arrives later this year. So far, that vehicle is only known as ""Project Midsize,"" and it is the first of several new EVs on an updated platform.

Investors will definitely be looking out for more details on Gravity production—and Project Midsize progress—during the startup's next earnings call, which is scheduled for February 24 at 5:30 PM Eastern.

Later this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio will decide whether to keep its statewide net-metering rules intact or whether to switch ratepayers to a less lucrative program proposed by American Electric Power’s Ohio utility.

The changes put forth by the utility are drastic and would raise costs and discourage others from going solar, a broad range of critics say.

“In a time that people are struggling to pay their bills, they are trying to gut net metering, which is one of the ways folks who are able to [can] save money by putting solar on their rooftop,” said Nolan Rutschilling, managing director of energy policy for the Ohio Environmental Council.

AEP’s proposal will be considered as part of the PUCO’s ongoing five-year review of the state’s net-metering rules. Parties’ case filings were due last month, although public comments can still be submitted.

The rules apply to the state’s investor-owned utilities: AEP’s Ohio Power Company, Duke Energy Ohio, AES Energy Ohio, and FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities. Ohioans have added more than 20,000 residential solar projects statewide since the current net-metering rules took effect about seven years ago, according to data from the sustainability consulting group Unpredictable City.

In effect, AEP wants to include distribution charges for all electricity flowing into a solar-equipped household, even if a big chunk winds up going back to the grid. The company describes the change as a shift from net usage to net billing. And it wants to limit net metering to customers who don’t pick their own electric generation supplier or take part in a community aggregation program.

The reduced compensation could substantially lengthen the payback period for rooftop solar investments.

“Residents that have already invested in solar have taken on the upfront capital cost because of the long-term utility savings supported by net metering requirements,” Casey Shevlin, director of sustainability and resilience for the city of Akron, wrote in a comment. ​“Their consumer rights need to be protected from net metering changes that could result in them benefiting less from solar investments they have made.”

Battles over net-metering rules have played out recently across the United States, including in the leading rooftop solar market of California.

There and elsewhere, critics of net metering argue that it forces the average customer to overpay for rooftop solar’s extra energy and that net billing is a fairer system. Supporters of net metering say that it provides systemwide cost savings by increasing distributed energy and that it’s a proven tool for deploying and democratizing clean electricity.

Among utilities, only AEP has formally opposed the recommendation by the commission’s staff to keep net-metering rules in place. The company’s proposal is supported by the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which said it wants to ensure there’s no ​“cost shifting” to people without rooftop solar.

But the AEP proposal has received massive pushback from environmental advocates, business groups, local governments, and others since its filing on the day before Thanksgiving.

The Citizens Utility Board of Ohio, Interstate Gas Supply, the Retail Energy Supply Association, Solar United Neighbors, the Ohio Environmental Council, and the Environmental Law & Policy Center have all filed formal replies with the PUCO, urging regulators to reject AEP’s arguments and to keep the current net-metering rules in place for all ratepayers.

AEP’s Ohio media relations office wrote via email, ​“Under net metering, a portion of the distribution-related charges are essentially shifted to other customers when the charges are calculated only for the net portion of the electricity delivered,” because infrastructure costs ​“are designed to be spread across the customers the system was built to serve.”

The company did not respond to Canary Media’s request for data showing how it or other regulated utilities would be hurt by net metering for customers who pick competitive energy suppliers or take part in community aggregation programs. The company has come after net metering before — and ultimately lost.

More than a decade ago, AEP took its arguments to limit net metering to the Ohio Supreme Court. The court ultimately dismissed that case after the PUCO released new rules that generally favored the company. A year after hearing lawyers’ arguments urging it to reconsider those rules, however, the commission changed course.

The current policy, adopted in December 2018, requires regulated utilities to compensate all rooftop solar customers for excess power, but it does not allow credit for distribution charges or for any avoided capacity charges.

AEP’s gambit to change the rules now surprised advocates for renewable energy, such as Mryia Williams, Ohio program director for Solar United Neighbors. ​“The PUCO staff had already concluded that net-metering rules are working as intended, and they didn’t think any changes needed to be made,” she said, referring to a Nov. 5 administrative law judge’s order in the rules docket.

The utility has not offered any data or other detailed assessment to justify its proposed changes, Williams said. And many rooftop solar owners relied on the current regulations when calculating whether to make the investment. ​“Everybody is just wanting to make sure that what’s already been promised is continued,” she said.

Plus, rooftop solar customers already pay for equipment to feed excess power to the utility. Levying distribution costs for electricity that customers wind up feeding back to the grid would, in effect, charge them for supplying the utility with distributed energy. Other energy suppliers don’t have to pay that expense, so it shouldn’t be something utilities can charge residents for either, said Nat Ziegler, manager of community solutions for Power a Clean Future Ohio.

Moreover, reducing net-metering compensation and limiting who can get it would discourage more people from adding rooftop solar, said Joe Flarida, executive director for Power a Clean Future Ohio.

“More generation on the grid will help limit the amount of price increases we’re seeing,” Flarida explained. ​“Certainly, if we can encourage more distributed energy, that would offset the amount of added power we need on the grid.”

Power a Clean Future Ohio is among the hundreds of groups and individuals who filed public comments with the PUCO, in addition to the formal party filings. That level of response represents a big change from a decade ago, Rutschilling said, noting increased interest in rooftop solar over the past few years.

People’s electricity bills have already jumped dramatically as grid operators like PJM have sounded the alarm about needing more electricity to meet demand from data centers, increased electrification, and other factors. And results of the most recent auction will almost certainly increase costs even more.

A bill introduced last fall would declare it state policy to ​“ensure affordable, reliable, and clean energy security,” with ​“clean energy” specified as meaning electricity from nuclear or natural gas, with no reference at all to renewables. But any new nuclear power requires years of review, and even with expedited permitting, Rutschilling noted, orders for new natural gas plant turbines have lag times of several years.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Solar-panels-on-home_GettyImages-1075631094.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4a77003943d409d4737112d82b6acb0e,N,,2026-01-06 10:00:09.700516

That skepticism persists despite a major policy hurdle — which led to legal fights costing taxpayers more than $4.2 million — now being out of the way.

As a part of a $50.1 billion budget deal that resolved a four-month impasse, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and members of his party who control the state House agreed to pull out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The controversial interstate program would have capped the total amount of carbon emissions that some companies in Pennsylvania could emit and forced them to pay for each ton emitted.

Leaving RGGI was a major Republican goal. State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that his chamber was unlikely to move energy legislation until the state courts resolved a lawsuit regarding Pennsylvania’s entrance into the program.

With the program out of the way, Shapiro said he expects action.

“For years, the Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy production. Today, that excuse is gone,” Shapiro said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “It is time now to look forward.”

Energy auctions in Pennsylvania offer a window into the challenge facing utility companies and consumers. The auctions are held by the operator of the state’s vast energy grid and are used to procure enough electricity for the future, and in recent years, prices have skyrocketed. In 2024, prices increased by more than 800% from the year prior. And at the December auction, energy prices hit a record high and would likely have increased further without a cap agreed to as part of legal action brought by Shapiro.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission also told consumers this past summer that the state saw “soaring power usage during multiple heat waves since mid-June and scorching conditions that pushed electricity demand on the regional power grid to its highest level in 14 years.” Supply and demand are the biggest factors in prices, an expert told Spotlight PA at the time.

Rob Routh, a lawyer and advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he’s watching the state Senate in particular to see if lawmakers are willing to move legislation that would increase renewable energy production or if the caucus will only support the natural gas industry.

“Are they just going to be ideologically fixed on one type of resource to generate electricity — gas?” Routh told Spotlight PA. “Are they willing to consider an all-of-the-above energy approach, or is it an explicit rejection of renewables?”

More energy on the table

Lawmakers' proposals to increase energy production take many approaches — from speeding up permitting to adjusting tax credits. They’ve also focused on various industries, from solar to nuclear power.

Shapiro told reporters that he wants to see state Senate Republicans pass his energy package, a slate of bills also known as the “Lightning Plan.”

It includes legislation that would amend some tax credits to benefit clean energy production, create a new board to streamline permitting for energy projects, and require electric companies to buy more renewable energy.

Another key part of Shapiro’s plan is to create a Pennsylvania-specific carbon cap-and-trade program, similar to RGGI. A majority of the payments from power producers to emit carbon dioxide — 70% — “would be returned to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bill,” according to the Shapiro administration.

Pittman has shot down that idea outright, saying that his caucus is not interested in supporting “any type of artificial cap-and-trade” program.

He has been more open to the other parts of the plan. He told Spotlight PA that revisiting the renewable energy standards “has merit,” and that the caucus is “willing to have a conversation over” the tax credit rewrites. These tax credits currently can be claimed by companies for a variety of purchases, including natural gas to manufacture petrochemicals, milk for dairy processing, and hydrogen fuel. Shapiro’s rewrite would include a new tax credit for clean energy producers.

“We would certainly be willing to have a conversation about any initiatives that help speed up projects in development so shovels get in the ground as soon as possible,” Pittman said.

Pittman said his caucus’ energy priorities include efforts “to enhance the use of our resources,” naming carbon capture as an example — a process through which carbon emissions are contained before they reach the atmosphere and are injected into deep underground wells. The waste can also be used to drill for more oil.

He also talked about speeding up efforts “to lower the taxes on job creators,” and issuing permits more quickly. However, he did not name specific legislation that he would support in the new year.

“I really think the best approach is to be as nimble and inviting as possible, to not try to have government programs and government initiatives artificially attempt to drive the marketplace,” Pittman told Spotlight PA days after the final budget deal.

Renewable energy, not climate protection

State House Democrats have proposed a range of legislation to lower barriers to increasing renewable or low-carbon energy sources, such as requiring that new warehouses be built to be compatible with solar panels and reducing permitting fees for small nuclear power plants.

Both the state House and Senate have passed bills that touch on solar energy with bipartisan support in recent years, although they had different goals.

Last session, the state House passed a proposal that would allow third parties to operate community solar energy facilities, which consumers could opt into. The idea is that “solar energy reduces the load on the grid while lowering electric bills,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The bill was reintroduced last year, but hasn’t been considered by either chamber.

Last summer, the state Senate passed a measure that would tighten oversight of Pennsylvania’s growing solar energy industry to help ensure that solar panels are properly decommissioned and all waste is properly disposed of. The requirements would not apply to homes and businesses that use solar panels to “generate electricity for their own use,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The full state House has not taken it up.

Katie Blume, legislative director for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, doubts that Democrats and Republicans will push energy bills to the finish line.

She pointed to other unresolved disagreements, including the regulation of slot-like skill games, that both parties have agreed are priorities but have been unable to advance.

“Why should I have faith in the Senate to do anything on energy, let alone affordability, when they can't even figure out skill games in their own caucus?” Blume told Spotlight PA.

Rob Bair, chair of the Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council, which represents many unionized workers who build power plants, echoed Blume’s concern. Bair said lawmakers will have to compromise and bolster both natural gas and solar, industries that are often pitted against each other.

“Everyone understands we need to do it,” Bair said of increasing power generation in the state. “But we are watching everything closely to see if the chambers can actually come together.”

Environmental protection bills have even worse odds of passing the General Assembly, said state Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware) at a December advisory committee meeting on climate change issue.

Vitali said that the “political reality” in the Capitol is that legislators have to focus on proposals that are “in conformance [with] labor and labor jobs.”

“Climate isn’t among the top five issues of legislators,” Vitali said. “There’s a need for leadership. … They have to do more than introducing bills and paying [climate change] lip service.”

Data centers on deck

Lawmakers have also singled out data centers as a major reason to increase energy production in the state.

Companies such as Amazon Web Services and Blackstone announced tens of billions of dollars in private investments to build out data centers in Pennsylvania. These facilities require huge amounts of both energy and clean water — the latter is used to cool the campuses. One projection estimates that global energy demand will increase by up to 165% by the end of the decade because of AI.

At the same time, Pennsylvania’s grid operator — PJM Interconnection — is seeing record-high prices at energy auctions. Those higher prices trickle down to consumers, according to utilities.

The most recent energy auction hit the price cap negotiated by Shapiro and the grid operator, and still failed to procure the amount of energy PJM had targeted.

Pittman has also identified data centers as a key cause for increasing energy production in the state. Though he has not identified specific regulatory procedures that he supports for the burgeoning industry, he said consumer prices and energy production go hand in hand.

“The best way to protect consumers with the advent of data centers is to make sure supply meets demand,” Pittman said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “We want to see responsible growth of data centers. We want to see [the] responsible growth of power supply.”

Any energy-related legislation will likely be referred to the state Senate’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, and its chair, Gene Yaw (R., Lycoming), said he doesn’t think more renewable energy is the answer.

“Renewable energies and data centers, they don't go together at all,” Yaw told Spotlight PA. “Data centers require continuous, non-intermittent power. And renewable power — it's intermittent and of limited duration at best.“

Routh, the advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said gas plants have their own limitations and argued that Yaw’s comments ignore the effectiveness of battery storage technology for renewable energy.

Still, he called the data center issue “top of mind for legislators and their constituents,” and said there’s potential for state House Democrats and Senate Republicans to collaborate on regulating their energy usage.

He pointed to a bipartisan agreement in the state budget deal related to the PUC, which oversees utilities across Pennsylvania. The legislation, which is now law, allows the agency to review and validate utility companies’ predictions to PJM of the amount of electricity needed — those estimates help set costs for consumers.

​​Routh said that one bill he’s keeping an eye on would direct the commission to draft regulations to oversee data centers and prevent spikes in electricity costs.

“It's a new issue. It's the key driver for why people's electric bills are going to be going up in Pennsylvania,” Routh said. “There is the potential for bills around data centers to break through traditional partisan ideological lines.”",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNi8wMS8wMW1uLWdjeTEteXdqei15cjB5LmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2026-01-06 09:01:06.548741

By KATIE COX

WISH-TV | wishtv.com

As the calendar turns to 2026, several Indiana laws approved during recent legislative sessions went into effect Jan. 1.

While Indiana lawmakers typically schedule most new laws to begin July 1, some provisions are delayed until the start of the year. For 2026, several of those changes center on taxes, along with a mix of unrelated measures affecting daily life for Hoosiers.

Property tax changes begin phasing in

Several provisions of Senate Enrolled Act 1, Indiana’s major property tax reform law, took effect Jan. 1.

The law reduces property taxes by increasing exemptions and deductions so less of a property’s value is taxed.

For 2026, the standard homestead deduction will remain at $48,000. At the same time, the supplemental deduction will increase from 37.5 percent to 40 percent. The standard deduction will gradually phase out and be eliminated by 2031, while the supplemental deduction will rise to two-thirds of a property’s value by that year.

A new homestead tax credit will also take effect. Property owners will receive a credit equal to $300 or 10 percent of their property tax bill, whichever amount is lower.

Additional changes include the elimination of the 30 percent tax floor on depreciated business equipment purchased in 2026 or later, meaning businesses will no longer be required to pay taxes on at least 30 percent of the original purchase price.

Rental properties and farmland will also receive a new supplemental deduction that begins at 6 percent in 2026 and increases to one-third of the gross assessed value by 2031.

The Department of Local Government Finance was required to launch an online property tax transparency portal by Jan. 1. The portal is intended to allow property owners to compare their current tax bill with alternative tax rates and provide feedback to state and local governments.

State income tax decrease

Indiana’s state income tax rate will decrease slightly at the start of the year, dropping from 3 percent to 2.95 percent.

The reduction stems from the 2023 budget cycle. For someone earning $100,000 annually, the change amounts to about $50 in yearly savings.

SNAP purchase restrictions

Under Indiana’s “Smart SNAP” initiative, SNAP recipients will no longer be allowed to use benefits to purchase certain sugary snacks and drinks.

According to the Family and Social Services Administration, the change affects about 450,000 Hoosiers and roughly 5,000 retailers statewide.

Data privacy updates

A consumer data privacy law will give Hoosiers new rights over how their personal data is collected and used by companies.

Consumers can request access to their personal data, correct inaccuracies, request deletion under certain conditions and opt out of targeted advertising.

Businesses are required to disclose how data is collected and used, implement reasonable security practices and respond to verified consumer requests. The Indiana Attorney General’s office is responsible for enforcement, with an emphasis on compliance.

Other laws taking effect Jan. 1

Several additional provisions begin with the new year:

Under House Enrolled Act 1380, electric vehicle registration fees will no longer apply to motorcycle owners.

Senate Enrolled Act 108 limits facilities that host bingo or casino game nights to no more than three nights per week.

House Enrolled Act 1004 requires the Department of Health to establish a reporting process for violations related to health insurance commission disclosures.

House Enrolled Act 1285 requires schools to ensure at least one employee on site during the school year has received nonviolent crisis intervention training.

Senate Enrolled Act 331 requires drivers who change a vehicle’s color through paint or vinyl wraps to notify the Bureau of Motor Vehicles within 30 days. Failure to do so could result in a warning from law enforcement.

Both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly will reconvene for the 2026 legislative session on Monday, Jan. 5, at 1:30 p.m.",,N,,2026-01-06 03:59:11.266875

Tesla sales dropped 8.6% over the year, with fourth-quarter deliveries down 16%. BYD surpassed Tesla for annual sales, driven by a 28% rise in battery electric vehicle demand.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk now appears more focused on autonomous technologies than EVs, as the company launches robotaxi trials and humanoid robots.

In Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, he said: “People just don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off… it’s going to be like a shock wave.

“We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we’re making a couple million a year.”

EV leaders through history

Based in Ohio, Baker Electric was the world’s largest EV maker in the early 1900s, even outselling gasoline cars in some markets.

Detroit Electric also built more than 13,000 EVs, but petroleum’s low cost made gas models more practical.

The Mitsubishi i-MiEV, launched in 2009, became the first highway-capable, mass-produced EV of the modern era, offering a range of around 62 miles and enjoying 18 months without direct competition.

The Nissan Leaf followed in 2010, becoming the first electric car to exceed 100,000 and later 200,000 sales.

Tesla took the global EV lead around 2015, overtaking the Leaf. For much of the following decade, Tesla’s greatest hurdle was production capacity rather than demand.

By 2026, the EV crown has shifted to China, where BYD’s vertically integrated model and broad vehicle lineup across price points are driving success.

How BYD beat Tesla

BYD has expanded into Europe and Southeast Asia with affordable models like the Seagull.

The company began as a battery manufacturer, becoming the world’s largest producer of nickel-cadmium batteries by 2003 — widely used in mobile phones. It launched its first plug-in hybrid in 2008 and has since grown into a global EV powerhouse.

BYD has produced its lithium iron phosphate “Blade Batteries” for both its own cars and other automakers since 2020. Electrive reports Tesla has even used these cells in some Model Y vehicles.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d3a239318976f8db34264ebdd7e3d9c6:914ea74b1fc1a4a836f1568f0748e98b/copy-of-gettyimages-974732880-credit-joshua-lott-elon-musk-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 03:58:38.126399

With 3,069 counties across the nation, nearly 40,000 elected officials and a workforce of more than 3.6 million, counties are on the frontlines delivering essential public services – from infrastructure and public safety to health, housing, elections and disaster response. Because counties implement numerous federal programs and enforce various regulations, NACo urges meaningful intergovernmental consultation throughout the federal policymaking process.

NACo stands ready as a nonpartisan, practical, data-driven partner for Congress, the Administration and federal agencies. We are committed to collaborating — offering technical assistance, sharing best practices and working to ensure that federal policy is grounded in local reality, responsive to community needs, and effective for America’s counties.

NACo policy positions are debated and voted on by ten policy steering committees comprising more than 1,400 county officials, along with the NACo Board of Directors and full membership.

By the Numbers

Counties invest nearly $743 billion each year into local communities to fund essential programs and services.

Counties own and operate 44 percent of America’s roads and 38 percent of bridges

Counties support 40 percent of public transit agencies

County governments operate 91 percent of our nation’s local jails

Counties invest more than $146 billion in infrastructure and maintaining and operating public works

Sixty-two percent of counties have federally-owned lands within our jurisdictions

Counties support and operate more than 900 hospitals, over 700 long-term care facilities, 750 behavioral health centers and more than 1,900 public health departments

Effective governance in the United States rests on collaboration among federal, state, local and tribal governments. County governments, led by our elected and appointed officials, are instrumental partners in our nation’s intergovernmental system, which balances, divides and shares power and responsibilities between all levels of government.

While counties are uniquely positioned to implement and administer vital intergovernmental systems, county input is often missing or delayed in the federal policymaking process. This leads to policies that create unfunded mandates, regulatory burdens, or unintended consequences for local communities.

NACo calls for formalized, consistent inclusion of counties in the design, rulemaking and implementation phases of federal policies and initiatives. This means ensuring county officials are consulted before finalizing legislation or regulations that affect public infrastructure, social services, environmental policy, or public safety.

By elevating county perspectives early — the frontline implementers — the federal government can foster more effective and efficient policy outcomes to achieve our shared priorities. Strengthening intergovernmental partnership improves coordination, avoids duplication, reduces costs and ultimately delivers better results for our shared communities.

Counties own and maintain a significant portion of our nation’s transportation infrastructure—including 44 percent of public road miles and 38 percent of bridges—and are integral to local transit, rural connectivity, aviation and the movement of freight. As the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act (IIJA) approaches its expiration, Congress has a is working to pass a reauthorization bill that will determine new funding levels, make policy changes and set the new course for federal transportation policy.

NACo urges Congress to pass a bipartisan, multi-year reauthorization bill that recognizes the crucial role that counties play in our transportation system by significantly increasing local access to formula funds, maintaining and improving discretionary grant opportunities, strengthening planning and project delivery—especially for rural counties—and streamlining permitting requirements to move projects faster and cheaper. Including these priorities in the next bill will not just support counties, but improve safety, mobility and economic development nationwide.

Nearly 70 percent of the nation’s 3,069 counties are rural, home to 38.2 million Americans and covering over two-thirds of the country’s land mass. For many of these communities, the Farm Bill remains a cornerstone of local economic development, land stewardship, infrastructure investment and nutrition access.

Farm Bill programs support 1.9 million farms across the U.S., helping to sustain agricultural production, preserve family farms and protect working lands. These investments also drive job creation and support county-led efforts to expand infrastructure, steward natural resources and boost rural economies.

The Farm Bill’s nutrition title authorizes key programs that help county residents access healthy, affordable food. Counties administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in ten states, representing more than one-third of total participants. In nine of the ten county-administered states, counties are responsible for either partially or entirely covering the non-federal share of administrative costs, which was increased under H.R. 1. As counties work to improve payment error rates, we urge our federal partners to delay the implementation of benefit and administrative cost shifts enacted under H.R. 1 to provide counties with sufficient time to streamline and improve SNAP administration.

With programs in the 2018 Farm Bill set to begin expiring on Sept. 30, 2026, counties are encouraged to connect with lawmakers now to ensure passage of a five-year, bipartisan Farm Bill that expands conservation and agriculture programs, invests in rural development, supports access to healthy and affordable foods and protects working lands for future generations.

Disasters — from wildfires and floods to hurricanes and extreme weather — are increasing in frequency and severity. Counties are typically the first to respond, coordinate evacuations, provide emergency services, manage shelters, clean-up, rebuild, and support long-term recovery. Yet current federal disaster systems often are slow, unpredictable and administratively burdensome — leaving counties to absorb costs and delays when local budgets and services are already stretched.

NACo urges Congress to enact legislation that would streamline disaster recovery, increase transparency and efficiency and make federal assistance more accessible to the communities we serve. Specifically, counties support key provisions of the bill including a universal disaster application, transitioning from a reimbursement-based model to a grant-based model for FEMA public assistance, a public assistance dashboard to increase transparency and modernizing FEMA’s mitigation programs.

Additionally, counties call on Congress to pass long-term reauthorization and reform legislation for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to improve affordability, mitigation assistance, flood risk mapping and program administration. The NFIP reduces the impact of flooding on public and private structures by providing affordable insurance and encouraging communities to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations.

Furthermore, counties support increased funding for the Emergency Management Grant Program and other mitigation grants to strengthen local hazard mitigation and preparedness efforts.

Counties play a vital role in fostering economic growth, supporting labor market stability and building resilient communities. To continue meeting evolving needs — from aging populations to housing shortages — counties require predictable federal funding combined with local flexibility.

Federal investments in the Economic Development Administration (EDA) are critical to support local economies through infrastructure development, workforce initiatives and public-private partnerships. As new labor challenges emerge, counties are vital front-line partners to their federal and state peers in modernizing resources for job seekers and employers alike. Investment in and reauthorization of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) supports local workforce capacity-building as communities face growing service demands.

Meanwhile, counties urge increased funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), which supports local housing and community development ecosystems and expands economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents. The program’s strength lies in its flexibility—direct-to-county payments and a versatile list of allowable uses empower counties to identify community needs and tailor solutions to meet them.

Counties are also critical partners in delivering human services, advocating for expanded federal resources to combat poverty, strengthen families and support vulnerable populations. This includes increasing investments in child care, addressing the phase-in of the Child Tax Credit and improving child welfare programs.

Counties call for reauthorizing the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to preserve flexibility while enhancing support for family self-sufficiency. We remain committed to working with Congress and federal agencies to ensure policies promote vibrant communities, economic stability for all residents and local flexibility with accountability.

Counties invest billions annually to improve health outcomes for residents, leveraging key federal programs such as the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant and the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment and Recovery Block Grant. These programs fund essential services, including housing assistance, case management, school-based supports and peer services, helping counties address the ongoing mental health crisis. To sustain our impact, Congress must fully fund these programs.

The federal–state–local Medicaid partnership is essential to strengthening care systems nationwide. As states implement provisions under H.R. 1, NACo urges our federal partners to work closely with county leaders to ensure new federal requirements are incorporated into state and county systems that can reliably support beneficiaries and uphold program integrity.

Counties must be empowered to design behavioral health and reentry services tailored to local needs, with adequate federal resources to support prevention, early intervention, and reduced recidivism without to burden of unfunded mandates. Federal policies should remove barriers to local innovation by providing flexible funding, reducing unnecessary compliance burdens, promoting integrated, community-based approaches, and advancing affordability measures that help residents maintain coverage and reduce strain on local health systems.

NACo calls for federal policies that remove barriers to local innovation and cross-sector collaboration by offering flexible funding, eliminating overly rigid compliance requirements, and promoting integrated, community-based approaches. Federal support should provide adequate resources, encourage prevention and early intervention, and help reduce recidivism and unmet health needs — all without burdening counties with unfunded mandates.

Local control over land use, zoning, environmental stewardship, and infrastructure planning is a bedrock principle of local governance and accountability. Counties support federal policies that balance environmental protection, public health, safety and local economic needs. As both regulators and regulated entities, counties are responsible for protecting local air, water and land resources under delegated authority from state and federal laws. Federal regulations and guidelines are most effective when they are clear, understandable and easily administered at the local level.

Counties advocate for federal policies that formally include counties as cooperating agencies in land-use decisions, environmental reviews, and permitting processes, such as under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Meaningful consultation, partnership, and deference to local input ensure that infrastructure investments and environmental protections reflect community values, priorities and long-term local planning goals.

As the U.S. Departments of Interior, Transportation and Energy, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies develop future regulations, NACo supports meaningful consultation with county governments early in the rulemaking process, and federal investments should be implemented more quickly by reforming the permitting process. Early engagement helps prevent unfunded mandates and other unintended consequences that could arise from implementing federal policies. Additionally, NACo supports increased federal funding and flexibility to counties to ensure the successful implementation of future regulations.

In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, counties must be prepared — not just to deliver traditional public services, but to lead on broadband deployment, cybersecurity, AI governance, energy infrastructure, and digital equity. Counties are critical to ensuring that remote, rural, and underserved communities have access to modern infrastructure and services.

NACo supports federal investment and partnerships that help counties build technology capacity — from expanding broadband, strengthening cybersecurity of local government systems, supporting energy resilience, providing AI governance frameworks, to workforce development in high-tech and infrastructure sectors. These investments will preserve local decision-making while positioning communities for competitiveness, resilience, and innovation.

Counties administer the vast majority of U.S. elections, including voter registration, poll operations, mail-balloting systems, ballot tabulation and certification of results. The integrity of American democracy depends substantially on county election administrators’ capacity.

In 2026, NACo urges federal investment in county election infrastructure, supports the recruitment and training of election workers, and encourages the modernization of systems — including equipment, cybersecurity, and accessibility for voters. By strengthening county election administration capacity, Congress can help ensure secure, efficient, and accessible elections, preserve public confidence, and uphold democratic values.",https://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/GettyImages-2230868747.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 07:57:23.320823

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, which includes the Office of Coastal Management, will take public comments on the proposed dredging expansion until Jan. 14.

The permit would allow Venture Global to move watterbottom and materials dredged during the construction of the CP2 LNG marine terminal, along with other materials produced in maintenance work at the company’s existing Calcasieu Pass facility, for placement within 729 acres of open water and highly fragmented marsh inside the wildlife refuge.

In August, environmental groups and local fishermen complained when the Venture Global dredge spilled mud they said made its way into Big Lake and covered hundreds of acres of marsh. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in September confirmed claims that mud released during the August dredge spill entered Big Lake and affected the fisheries.

In October, For a Better Bayou, FISH, Natural Resources Defense Council, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network, Healthy Gulf and others filed a lawsuit challenging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the terminal and feeder pipeline in southwest Louisiana. The brief argues the commission failed to consider significant, concrete harms to local industry and communities.

A Lake Charles restaurant filed a lawsuit in November seeking less than $10,000 in damages from its local oyster supplier, Pig & Rooster Oyster Farms, which has filed a third-party demand with Venture Global, alleging the company’s dredging spill last August caused silt and mud to cover the company’s floating oyster cages.

The restaurant, Salt Revival House, claimed it received oysters “that were “dead, contaminated, discolored, or otherwise unfit for use and consumption,” according to the report. The farm states that the “vast majority” of 5.2 million oysters harvested since the spill have been unfit for sale or consumption.

Additionally, the oyster farm is asking a judge to halt Venture Global’s dredging operations until it complies with permits.

Venture Global, the second largest exporter of LNG in Louisiana and the U.S. behind Cheniere Energy, expects to have more than 27 million tons of annual production capacity by the end of 2026. The company opened its Plaquemines export terminal in December 2024.

To advance integration across its LNG supply chain, Venture Global has signed contracts with South Korean shipbuilders to buy nine LNG-powered tankers, all of which are which are expected to operational by the end of the year.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2021/12/Venture-Global.jpg?w=622,N,,2026-01-06 13:59:01.632145

Auto analysts said the industry is still sorting out what comes next, and the uncertainty in demand is hitting EV-related jobs nationwide.

Experts said companies like Ultium are working fast to develop new battery technologies to keep up with the pace.","Ultium Cells has cut more than 1,300 jobs at its Lordstown battery plant on Monday as the company pauses production.

The planned layoff comes after company leaders said electric vehicle demand is slower than expected, and Ultium said it plans to use the downtime to make upgrades aimed at flexibility.

Auto industry researchers told 21 News Ultium's plans to adapt during this pause matter because battery technology has changed quickly, and plants have to keep up.

Auto analysts said the industry is still sorting out what comes next, and the uncertainty in demand is hitting EV-related jobs nationwide.

Lordstown workers are expected to be laid off until summer, while others are indefinite.

Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty and OSU College of Engineering Industry Collaborations Director David Emerling said the lower demand is due to higher costs coupled with policy changes that don't incentivize consumers and investors in the EV market.

""What we need is more affordable, compelling EVs,"" Valdez Streaty said, ""I think the Lordstown, unfortunately, is just another casualty of what's going on in the overall EV market.""

Emerling said hybrids may matter in the near term if they can reduce range anxiety while battery tech continues to evolve, but Emerling and Valdez Streaty said the bigger issue is that companies need a stable environment to plan expensive, long-term projects.

They said that the environment has been disrupted after EV tax incentives went away and tariffs came into play, making battery production more expensive.

""Where we're at right now with the EV industry is turmoil,"" Emerling said, ""That is because of the fact that regulatory people in Washington are kind of changing the landscape fairly quickly.""

Despite the uncertainty, auto analysts are confident this stall in EV demand and pains Ultium's facing are temporary, but said updated policies, such as imposing incentives to boost EV growth, would be ideal to save jobs and plants like Ultium.

""I think the Lordstown example is just part of a larger issue with the EV industry. I think, really, the driver is the elimination of the Inflation Reduction Act, so you have the consumer credit that went away, which was for the purchase of new, used, and leasing,"" Valdez Streaty added, ""That eliminated at the end of September, but then you have the 45x credit, which helped manufacturers get funding for EV manufacture for batteries, and that's being phased out.""

""I don't think EVs are going away,"" she said, ""It's just a huge timeline shift slowdown because of the regulatory changes that happened with the IRA elimination, the corporate average fuel efficiency, the CAFE standards are less stringent, so manufacturers can continue to make trucks and SUVs and not be penalized.""

Environmental justice groups vary in size and strength, but they often do know how to do this sort of organizing.
RGW: For the climate movement to help, there needs to be real, frank conversations and reckonings around race and class, right?","It’s an odd fact that when environmentalists in the United States talk about the ups and downs of their movement in recent years, much of the discussion turns on something called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Efforts to push the potentially transformational Green New Deal—both the original resolution introduced in Congress in 2019 and subsequent legislation introduced by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders—were consistently rebuffed by lawmakers, with opponents claiming it was too ambitious and expensive. Instead, after Joe Biden was elected president in 2020, environmental policy issued from key spending bills on infrastructure and inflation reduction as well as a series of executive orders. The IRA, the Biden administration’s signature law, was primarily marketed as a way to tame inflation by cutting the federal budget deficit. Yet the bill devoted billions of new spending to clean energy, while Biden announced parallel government-wide environmental justice policies: Justice40, billed as a way to direct investment “to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution,” and the Community Change Grants Program, which Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency announced in late 2024 would award nearly $1.6 billion “to advance local, on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience, and build community capacity.”

Though some mainstream environmental groups hailed the Biden policies as sweeping and historic, a single four-year term was not enough time to reverse decades’ worth of inadequate and counterproductive policies on climate. The Biden years ended with the U.S. environmental movement in a fractured and demoralized state, partly because of a sense that the administration didn’t do enough to break the grip of the fossil fuel industry. A critique emerged that the Democratic policies were not able to meld clean-energy initiatives with the kind of racial and class equity envisioned by Justice40. As Politico reported in the year after the passage of the IRA, “The most aggressively climate-minded president in history is getting flak from his green base.”

A single four-year term was not enough time to reverse decades’ worth of inadequate and counterproductive policies on climate.

Both Rhiana Gunn-Wright and Maria Lopez-Nuñez are leading critics of the top-down technocratic environmental policymaking that many in the Democratic Party see as the only serious way to address climate change. Gunn-Wright joined the New Consensus economic and social-policy think tank in 2018 to work on the development of the Green New Deal; she later worked for almost five years on environmental and climate policy for the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive research center. Lopez-Nuñez, as a community organizer in Newark, New Jersey, helped pass a state law that is described as one of the toughest in the nation in restricting the cumulative effects of pollution. Lopez-Nuñez was also one of thirty-six members of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which Biden created by executive order almost immediately after his inauguration in January 2021. From there, Lopez-Nuñez watched as the Biden administration looked for technocratic solutions in the energy sector while failing, in her view, to connect with working-class communities. Gunn-Wright also faulted the Biden policies on equity grounds, writing for Hammer & Hope in 2023, “Black people [are] at risk of being left behind and locked out of the clean energy economies spurred by the IRA.”

Then came the election of Donald Trump. With its Project 2025 blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation, the Trump administration started to move aggressively to reverse as much of the Biden agenda as possible. Trump issued an executive order on the day of his inauguration freezing all IRA funds. Although courts ruled he did not have the authority to cancel spending that was already appropriated, his agencies found ways to eliminate billions in funding. Passed this summer, the administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” rescinded some of the IRA spending and tax credits while directing new subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Meanwhile, the EPA made huge cuts in staff and ended funding for environmental justice measures, while the Department of Energy issued a report in July asserting that the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are “less damaging economically than commonly believed, and that aggressive mitigation strategies could be more harmful than beneficial.” The moves through 2025 were directed at clean energy and environmental justice: in August, Trump’s EPA announced the termination of $7 billion in grants that were meant to help low-income households install solar panels on their homes and expand community solar power initiatives.

In speaking over Zoom and following up by email with Gunn-Wright and Lopez-Nuñez this fall, I wanted to understand the critique that recent Democratic policies were skewed against minority groups, as well as their views on how the environmental movement might move forward with new strategies in these years of all-out federal assault. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

—Dave Denison

Dave Denison: Let’s zero in on what took place in the Biden years. You’ll hear from the Biden partisans about all the billions of spending on environmental policy that happened. There also was a lot of talk in the administration about how to benefit diverse communities, right? But was it mostly talk?

Maria Lopez-Nuñez: Let’s start with the good. For the first time, community organizations could get access to up to $20 million at a time. The Community Change Grants were the start of something beautiful—the start. And they should have got it out much faster. Most of those Community Change Grants did not go out until the last six months. It’s funny because the Trump people complain that they were throwing money out the window. I wish they were! They were being slow as molasses to get money out the door. Now, at the same time, there were a lot of bad things in the IRA that were pushed, quite frankly, by environmentalists. Like carbon sequestration: what we saw on the ground is these science-fiction projects that were going to absorb the carbon. Instead of ending fossil fuels, we’re going to suck carbon up, put it back in the ground, and push carbon dioxide along pipelines—sometimes to extend the life of fossil fuel production. Things like that were problematic, to say the least. Another example: the hydrogen fuel projects that are probably going to be financially stranded assets—because who uses hydrogen? The whole making-fuel-out-of-water thing costs too much money without federal investment and would require the whole system be built anew—it is extremely challenging to reuse pipelines we already have. Hydrogen gas molecules are so small there would be leakage. So once the federal money is gone the whole thing falls apart. A bunch of these projects were being pushed on communities of color with no ability to refuse. And then there were all the “community benefits plans,” which were, again, to communities on the ground, often seen as extortion. Like, “Oh, we’ll give you a few jobs, but you’re going to trade in generational health, and you’re going to have a lesser quality of life because of these power plants that get dumped in your neighborhood.” It was a mixed bag with the Biden administration. I thought they were terrible messengers. They kept relying on influencers and the lily-white environmental people to go spread the message. They were not talking to the average person.

DD: Rhiana, you’ve written that after the IRA you saw the United States “relying on white supremacy to decide how to allocate the power and resources that come from going green.” I think that you’re talking about a whiteness problem in the environmental movement.

Rhiana Gunn-Wright: Whiteness is a problem for policymaking in general, right? I don’t think it’s unique to the environmental movement. It’s pronounced in the environmental movement because the movement has been segregated for a really long time. It’s understandable, however, because we have a political system that privileges white people and white voters. So when they’re at the center of that system, and you have electeds who want to get elected through that system, putting forward policies that center those folks and help them the most makes sense electorally. For you to think that a policy that primarily benefits white people is a net good requires a studied ignorance about how we are connected as people in the country. It just makes terrible sense in terms of sustainability.

DD: Give a quick example, though, of how some of these policies were geared toward more affluent white people.

RGW: The IRA’s tax credits, for instance. Individuals were going to get money for, say, putting solar panels on your house or switching to an induction stove. Tax credits are not distributed equitably. They privilege people who have tax burdens—if you don’t have a tax burden, you’re not going to see that money. And you need to have the money to do the initial investment and have a home to begin with. There was very little for renters, who are disproportionately people of color. They’re younger and have less money. Homeownership is like 75 percent white in the United States. So if most of the money that’s moving through the IRA for individual electrification of residences is moving through tax credits for homeowners, that’s going to be disproportionately white and affluent. The vast majority of people who took those credits made over $100,000 a year.

But it was also the whole debacle around permitting reform with former West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. This was a fight to curtail the environmental review process in order, ideally, to make it easier and faster to build clean energy infrastructure. The problem was that Manchin, and later much of the climate movement—especially the clean-energy wing—wanted to accomplish that by gutting the National Environmental Policy Act, the law that requires agencies to conduct environmental review for all energy projects, including fossil fuel projects. Weakening NEPA also makes it much easier to build these projects, largely by making it harder for communities to bring suits against them—even in places like the Gulf South, where residents are already saddled with tons of pollution. The climate movement advocated for permitting reform over the objections of the environmental justice movement, only for Trump to turn around and gut NEPA once in office, using the movement’s arguments to justify it, and cancel clean-energy projects and federal clean-energy funding. So now the only energy projects really benefitting from so-called permitting reform are fossil fuel projects.

What happens if you gut NEPA? How do people push back on fossil fuel permitting? These concerns were shrugged off by groups like the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, and the American Clean Power Association, and “abundance” advocates like Ezra Klein, the Institute for Progress, and the Breakthrough Institute as environmentalists being too picky, caring too much about birds and trees and not understanding what the stakes were. Many of the people who would be affected, particularly if fossil fuel projects became easier to build, were low-income folks—black, white, brown, Native, you name it—already living amid the kind of pollution that these dudes don’t even drive through. But it didn’t matter. Permitting-reform advocates put them in the same bucket as rich homeowners going to town council meetings to shout down a new wind farm. You’ll hear this language often when it comes to environmental justice: “They don’t understand the stakes of climate change. They don’t understand how our system works. They don’t understand the trade-offs that need to be made.”

DD: What you’re saying reminds me of a story I heard Yale professor Dorceta Taylor tell: when she got to her first environmental science class in college in the early 1980s, she was the only non-white person in the class. She asked the professor about it, and the professor came right out and said, “Well, black people aren’t interested in the environment.” So there is a stereotype—but that was a long time ago!

RGW: You see dog whistles in that direction still. If black people are involved in climate, they’re assumed to be environmental justice activists. Even if they don’t work on environmental justice, they’re called activists—even if they’re policy experts. Very prominent voices in the climate movement came out post-IRA and said they don’t know if environmental justice advocates care about climate change because they had reservations about the act.

MLN: I want to be clear: when I say white, I mean white upper-class rich people. Because I really feel a lot of solidarity with working-class white folks. They’re also being dumped on with a bunch of power plants and chemicals in their neighborhoods. Working-class people are busy enough as it is without having out-of-touch environmentalists tell them they need to take personal responsibility for stopping climate change. You get a solar panel on your roof and change your car, and that’s going to solve climate change? They don’t have the money to pay for those things upfront and then wait for a tax credit. And even if everyone did those things, they wouldn’t stop anything unless we go to the source, which is fossil fuels. Those are societal shifts, not individual ones like recycling or buying the right car. It should be about corporations ending their fossil fuel dependency.

RGW: You see this huge emphasis on expanding clean energy, but there’s so little attention paid to actually reducing the supply of fossil fuels. The Republicans have been very good about making clean energy an enemy of Americanness. You’re going to see very, very few politicians sign up to reduce the amount of fossil fuels or to deal with those very hard problems that come with fossil fuels.

DD: We don’t expect the Republican Party to stand up against fossil fuels. The Democratic Party, you know, there is a certain rhetoric that you’ll hear about climate change—but when it comes to a national movement against ExxonMobil and the banks that are behind ExxonMobil, the Democratic Party is petrified. And look back, not just to the Biden years but the Obama years. He’s the one who ramped up oil and gas and said, “That was me, people.”

RGW: You still get a lot of kudos on both sides for expanding fossil fuel production. In the Biden administration, there was this push and pull. You saw a stated commitment to environmental justice and steps toward that. But when you look into the programs, you see them watered down in a way to create the least amount of friction. For instance, Justice40 said that 40 percent of the benefits of environmental investment should go to disadvantaged communities. Sounds great. But then you start to get into the nuts and bolts of it. You’re not saying 40 percent of the money, you’re saying 40 percent of the benefits. Which means the Biden administration ends up counting funding of carbon capture and sequestration projects as part of Justice40—even though the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council asked them not to. There were community benefits plans where project developers agreed to invest some of the federal funding they would receive for the project in “employment and equity benefits” for the host communities. You also end up seeing a lot of preexisting programs, like the Weatherization Assistance Program, the Rural Energy for America Program, or HUD’s Healthy Home Grants, where money that was already going to disadvantaged communities is also being counted as Justice40 funding. So what you’re seeing is not an infusion of new investments or benefits in these communities so much as existing funding being recategorized in a way that suggests, perhaps, more progress than was actually happening. Similarly, a lot of the clean-energy money going out in the IRA was not included in Justice40. The tax credits to corporations, that wasn’t included in Justice40. That means that some of the biggest investments that the federal government is making environmentally are actually not subject to Justice40, because that would have been a commitment to environmental justice that could have upset really powerful donors.

“If every policy has to help white people—at least white upper-class folks—have a greater share of material resources, there’s only so many ways you can solve a problem.”

MLN: There were plenty of opportunities for state and municipal Democrats to get in line as well and look at their own budgets. A huge percentage of federal funding goes through the states. If there was a true Democratic commitment to Justice40, then states with Democratic governors should have stepped up and implemented Justice40 allocations within their budgets. Communities needed to see that money faster, and the path to that was through state governors, who should have taken up the Justice40 mantle. That would have gotten them the approval that they were so desperately looking for. Instead, they were like, “Okay, let’s direct a lot of the money and programs toward red states, and then Trump will protect it.” Sixty percent of the announced projects, making up 85 percent of the investments, were in Republican congressional districts. The hope was that Trump and the Republicans would not attack the IRA after their constituencies saw the benefits, but they went after all the funds anyway. We’ve seen he respects no line. He’ll run over anybody, even his supporters.

DD: I feel like that brings us back to where we are right now, with the near-total triumph of fossil fuel power in this Trump administration. You know he’s perversely opposed to wind power and solar power. There will be no talk in this administration of environmental justice or diversity—that’s all been squelched. And I wonder if you both think that the environmental movement is in any shape to take this challenge on. Is it too fractured, or too slumbering, to respond now?

RGW: What Maria was talking about, about civic engagement, is so true. Especially at a time when people don’t trust government and see the government not responding to the desires and the needs of everyday people, particularly if you are working class, broke, poor. This is an example of white supremacy really hampering policymaking, because it hampers your ability to think broadly and widely. Because if every policy has to ultimately help maintain white privilege or help white people—at least white upper-class folks—have a greater share of material resources, there’s only so many ways you can solve a problem. And again, we have to be very real about the history of the United States. For all that we talk about democracy, true democracy—as in public participation, everyone mattering—is coded as black and brown and dangerous to white people. And you see it in the Republicans. There’s this call, “We don’t want a democracy, we’re going back to the republic. We need an ordered republic.” Some people get a say. Other people don’t get a say. Only some people are fit to make these large-scale decisions. So when you ask if we are too fractured, I think, in raw materials, in people power, no. Even big climate groups that people think of as Big Green, they’ve had budget reductions, but they are not broke. There’s still a lot of money in the environmental space. Clean-energy investments in the United States are really taking a hit; new investments in renewable energy, for instance, fell 36 percent in the first half of 2025—about $20.5 billion—compared to 2024. But they’re not gone. Those were historic levels of investment in 2024, so even with the decline, there is still money going into clean energy, especially globally, where investments in clean energy have actually increased. And the environmental justice movement, I think, has in fact not lost energy, the way that the climate movement has post-IRA. There has been, for example, a lot of attention around environmental injustice related to data centers, particularly with Elon Musk’s xAI facility in Memphis. I’ve seen far more coverage and energy around those kinds of stories than I have with, say, the increase of greenhouse gas emissions over the last two years. The question is whether we’re willing to work together toward a vision of climate activism that likely does not look the way that white, affluent folks want it to look or are comfortable with it looking. Because there are lots of ways to tie in climate to the things people care about: health care, affordability, even antiauthoritarianism. There’s so much that the climate connects to that we can build coalitions around. It requires not making climate secondary but knitting it into an overall idea of what a good life is. People of color are some of the most persuadable people on climate change, if you talk to them and make the connections. Environmental justice groups vary in size and strength, but they often do know how to do this sort of organizing.

DD: Maria is in the middle of some of that. As you know, there is no White House Environmental Justice Council—that was done away with very quickly under Trump. But I saw that you’re part of an effort now called the People’s Advisory Council on Environmental Justice. It sounds like you’ve got an idea to take some of this discussion out of Washington and ignite it at the grassroots, right?

MLN: Environmental justice got on the radar during the Biden administration. He said it a few times on the campaign trail and created a council after being elected. It was short-lived, but for people on the ground the essence remained the same: How do you have a functional government that works for you, that doesn’t work for corporations? To that end, me and some of my colleagues decided that the best part of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council was the public hearings. At this moment in time, we need more of them. I don’t think that it’s possible to come up with good policies without the people that that policy is meant to serve. And that’s why we’re on tour to listen to communities. We are going to places that are unexpected, often neglected, less visible. We’re making sure we then reach out to every corner of the state where folks are working toward a better quality of life. In Greensboro, North Carolina, five hundred people came out without any promotion. There’s a need out there. Many communities feel neglected by both parties and disillusioned with processes and their governments at all levels. They spoke to enduring issues and dysfunctions in government, about how the silos within agencies and between different departments meant that people lived with contamination and health issues without hope for resolutions. There were communities living with the impacts of failed federal policy, with no access to programs that might make a difference. They don’t know that there is a national movement and have never heard of most mainstream environmental organizations. It just shows how much of a field there is out there. There are so many people in all the corners of this country who have not been engaged yet. No movement has ever knocked on their door and asked them for their vote or their opinion on what policies should be. So that’s what we’re trying to do.

RGW: For the climate movement to help, there needs to be real, frank conversations and reckonings around race and class, right? We did a little bit after the Green New Deal. We did some of that coalition building. Part of the reason I was so heartbroken by the IRA was that it felt like we had tried so hard to build these coalitions and were starting to work together in a way that was more productive. But when the rubber hit the road, it was more of the same. Climate activists and environmental justice activists are going to be most powerful when we are knit together in a larger coalition. So that means supporting immigrant rights. That means supporting voting rights. Supporting as in leveraging our money, our connections, our bodies to further these fights. The Biden administration, for all of its successes, really showed us the limits of that model and the need to move away from it. It didn’t really get us to where we needed to go. We had the biggest climate investment that the United States has ever made, and people didn’t know about it.",https://thebaffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/b82-denison-wright-nunez.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:00:20.023984

And it dropped a bit of a bomb about its plans to enter the US market, still leaving some wiggle room, but signaling a more concrete intention than we’ve heard yet.

Autoline Network posted a video interviewing Ash Sutcliffe, head of global communications for Geely Holding Group. Geely is a massive Chinese conglomerate, with several brands around the world. Some of those brands are Western brands, such as Volvo, Polestar, Smart and Lotus. It also owns its own homegrown brands, Zeekr and Lynk & Co.

The interesting part about this interview is that it happened at CES, which is currently happening in Las Vegas, Nevada. The interesting thing about Las Vegas is that it’s in America, and in case you haven’t heard, America effectively bans Chinese cars from being imported.

So, what’s Geely doing at CES? Well, they’re getting ready to enter the US market, according to Sutcliffe.

Sutcliffe mentioned that CES has become a primary show for high tech vehicles in the US, so Geely wanted to bring its cars here to let US media have a good look at them. Sutcliffe continued and said Geely is “looking at all global markets where we can expand… the big question for us is when and where will we go to the USA? I think we will have an announcement on that in the next 24-36 months. So, I think its exciting times for Geely Holding Group.”

Notably, Sutcliffe said that an announcement will come within 2-3 years, not that cars would be on the road by then. He specifically brought up Zeekr and Lynk & Co. as potential brands to bring to the US.

When pressed on tariffs, Sutcliffe brushed them aside, stating that Geely is a global company and understands how to work around or work with trade restrictions. He did point out that since Geely is a major shareholder in Volvo cars, its facility in South Carolina would be a natural option for local production. After all, Volvo and Polestar are already producing cars in the US, so bringing Geely cars wouldn’t be a big jump (Lotus also sells in the US, but doesn’t produce here).

Another concern is recent US regulations on Chinese software in cars, but Sutcliffe said that this won’t be an issue: as a global company it’s used to following various countries’ data protection regulations, so it will just do whatever needs to be done to follow those regulations, whatever they may be when the time comes. After all, EU has GDPR, California has CCPA, and so on.

Electrek’s Take

While the interview fell short of telling us about any specific plans for launch dates, it seems clear that Geely has put plenty of thought into this, and an entry into the US market seems likely, if not inevitable. Tariffs were never going to keep Chinese EVs out of the US forever, so we hope the US is ready to pick up the pace and get down to competing (hint: it’s not).

I haven’t had the opportunity to drive a Zeekr or Lynk & Co vehicle yet (though my Electrek colleagues have), but I have driven a few Chinese EVs, and have driven Volvos and Polestars, which both still have largely Western operations despite their Chinese ownership.

And what I, and any journalist or auto industry professional I trust, have found, is that there’s a lot of quality coming out of China right now.

There’s been a long-held belief in America that Chinese products are cheaper, lower quality, and that they merely consist of stolen ideas.

But regardless of whether that was ever true, what’s clear is that it’s not true in EVs. Chinese EVs are good, varied, affordable, and getting better quickly – and they have a lot of their own ideas, too.

The Chinese auto industry is booming, it’s booming because of EVs specifically, and that has catapulted it to being the largest auto exporter in the world, dethroning all the traditional automaking powers which have held the top position for the last several decades.

Meanwhile, Western governments are asleep at the wheel, kowtowing to automaker pleas to let them pollute just a little bit longer. And the automakers themselves fail to grasp trends in their own industry, in a year marked by several automakers ignoring their own sales numbers and doubling down on the shrinking fossil-fueled portion of the market.

I don’t think that’s a recipe for success for the West. Ignoring trends and refusing to adapt has rarely worked well for any company or any industry. And trying to delay the inevitable with tariffs doesn’t work either.

Geely’s pre-announced entry into the US could, and should provide a wake-up call for this nation’s automakers and government. They should have woken up long ago, but now they’ve been given a deadline: 2-3 years and we’re (announcing that we’re) coming for your market.

I’d like to hope the US will take this wake-up call… but let’s be honest, with the type of idiocy we have at the top, currently busy trying to steal a soon-to-be-worthless resource from a sovereign nation, that wake-up call is unlikely to happen until we get some real leadership around here.

There is still an open question as to whether US consumers will accept Chinese EVs, given the high levels of sinophobia in the country. But I think that if the US consumer is provided with high quality and affordable prices, the question will be easily answered. Besides, it’s not like we haven’t seen this before – many of the same things were said about Japanese cars in the 70s, and yet, here we are.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/ZEEKR-001-FR-Launch-China.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-06 02:58:30.817763

Even the most bullish industries are not immune to despondency.

Yet the findings of DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025 show that while the transition is uneven and slower than the world needs, it is not in decline. Despite the pessimism, it continues to move forward, reshaped by security concerns and an accelerating shift toward competitive renewable electricity.

MOMENTUM PERSISTS, BUT UNEVENLY

Some elements of the transition, particularly those driven by market fundamentals, are accelerating so quickly that they are becoming virtually unstoppable.

Solar PV, onshore wind and batteries have plunged in cost, largely due to China’s massive industrial scale clean energy manufacturing. As a result, variable renewables will account for 32% of global power by 2030, and more than half of the world’s electricity by 2040.

Electricity generation will grow exponentially, expanding 120% by 2060 as well rapidly becoming less carbon intensive, with the fossil share of power supply collapsing from 59% today to just 4% by 2060.

Yet other parts of the transition, those dependent on high-cost technologies or strong policy continuity, are struggling. Hydrogen and its derivatives, like methanol and ammonia, floating wind and novel nuclear solutions feature more muted growth in our forecast. While these technologies remain essential for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, their large-scale deployment is not expected until the 2040s.

Such divergence means that the overall transition is now marginally slower than DNV projected a year ago. And yet, despite short-term turbulence, we forecast that fossil fuels’ share of global primary energy will fall from 80% today to 36% by 2060, an unprecedented shift in the modern energy era.

SETBACK IN NORTH AMERICA

Much attention has focused on the policy reversals in the United States, where the rollback of climate measures and the renewed promotion of fossil fuels are delaying the region’s transition. Our modeling shows the changes will set back North America’s emission reductions by about five years and leave the region emitting 500–1,000 Mt more CO2 annually through to 2050 than previously expected.

These reversals do not meaningfully alter the global picture though, with China continuing to set renewables buildout records, installing more than half of the world’s new solar PV capacity and 60% of new wind. Many countries, particularly in the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Africa, are adopting Chinese clean technologies at scale. Europe, despite some economic and political headwinds, remains firmly committed to climate action while simultaneously striving to protect industrial competitiveness.

Across all regions, energy security now shapes energy policy as much as affordability and sustainability. Governments are seeking to reduce import dependence, build up critical supply chains and protect domestic manufacturing, all of which will take long time. This shift simultaneously boosts renewables in many importing regions, where solar, wind and nuclear are seen as secure domestic options, while increasing fossil output in exporting regions such as North America and the Middle East.

THE GRID BOTTLENECK

Electrification is the defining feature of the transition and electricity’s share of final energy demand will double from 21% today to 43% by 2060. But this rapid electrification is exposing the structural weakness in the world’s power grids, which are still expanding far too slowly.

Europe is already experiencing a “gridlock” that constrains renewable deployment. DNV’s analysis shows solar capacity in Europe could be 16% higher and wind 8% higher by 2035 if grids were built at the required pace.

North America faces a similar challenge, compounded by surging energy demand from AI data centers. While AI’s energy use may seem alarming, it will represent only 3% of global electricity by 2040. Still, in North America, where data center activity has the highest concentration, AI will account for an extraordinary 12% of electricity demand by that year.

OFFSHORE RENEWABLES

Offshore wind has recently faced rising costs, supply chain difficulties and delayed project pipelines, but our outlook shows a strong resurgence from 2030 onward. Costs stabilize and supply chains mature, setting the stage for offshore wind to become a central pillar of low-cost, energy-secure power systems. In the longer run, floating offshore wind is also poised for significant expansion as nations with deep-water coastlines seek domestic renewable resources.

Behind-the-meter solar and storage, already one-third of global solar installations, demonstrate how distributed generation is changing energy systems on land. A similar decentralization is emerging offshore, where hybrid floating platforms can power oil and gas operations and reduce emissions from maritime infrastructure.

Harder-to-decarbonize sectors face a slower trajectory than previously forecast. The global share of hydrogen in the 2050 energy mix has declined over the last three years from 4.8% to 3.5% in our outlook, reflecting delayed industrial adoption and slower cost reductions.

EMISSIONS ARE FALLING, GRADUALLY

Global CO2 emissions are expected to peak in 2025 and fall 43% by 2050. But this is not enough to meet the Paris Agreement. The remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C will be exhausted in 2029, and the world exceeds 2°C around mid-century unless stronger action is taken. By 2100, our forecast trajectory leads to around 2.2°C of warming, underscoring the need for faster decarbonization across all sectors.

For the ocean technology and maritime sectors, the transition is still moving, in some cases decisively, but it needs acceleration. Electrification, offshore wind, ocean-based renewable systems, zero-carbon fuels and subsea infrastructure will define the next phase.

The transition may be slower than we want, but it remains unstoppable. Our task now is to scale what works and fix what is blocked, ensuring the ocean industries remain at the forefront of the clean energy future.",https://oceannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/72-456959322-69467a660b02f.jpeg,N,,2026-01-06 03:58:34.387287

Combined, the two refineries produce 284,000 barrels of oil per day, about 17% of the state’s refining capacity.
“If you limit the supply of fuel coming out of California, you’re going to see that cost increase,” Paul Enos, CEO of the Nevada Trucking Association, told The Nevada Independent.
Joe Lombardo has repeatedly raised concerns about Nevada’s fuel insecurity, framing it as a safety issue if shortages cripple transportation hubs or first responder operations.
Nevadans already pay well over the national average because of its reliance on California fuel, which consistently ranks among the most expensive for gas.","The recent closure of a California oil refinery — and plans to shutter another in the near future — have some experts warning of potential fuel shortages and price spikes in Nevada and other Western states that depend on the Golden State.

California supplies roughly 88% of Nevada’s fuel, including diesel and jet fuel. But Phillips 66 closed a refinery in the Los Angeles area in October, and earlier this year, Valero submitted a notice that it plans to close a Bay Area refinery by April 2026. Combined, the two refineries produce 284,000 barrels of oil per day, about 17% of the state’s refining capacity.

Though there are several reasons for refinery closures, it comes as California is trying to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2045, including by slashing oil use.

“If you limit the supply of fuel coming out of California, you’re going to see that cost increase,” Paul Enos, CEO of the Nevada Trucking Association, told The Nevada Independent. “The policies that they make there have an impact (on) every citizen of Nevada.”

Gov. Joe Lombardo has repeatedly raised concerns about Nevada’s fuel insecurity, framing it as a safety issue if shortages cripple transportation hubs or first responder operations. Along with the Nevada Commission on Homeland Security, Lombardo recently formed a fuel resiliency subcommittee that he said is designed to “develop long-term strategies that strengthen our infrastructure, diversify supply routes, and protect Nevada’s future.”

The potential for a rise in prices from the refinery closures is what will mitigate potential shortages, said Elliott Parker, professor and economics chair at UNR.

“You’ve got to get people to drive less if you have less supply,” he said. “That comes with a cost — if you don’t let the prices go up, then you will have shortages.”

The need for ‘bipartisan, regional communication’

Almost all the gas, diesel and jet fuel consumed in the Las Vegas Valley is transported via the CalNev pipeline, which runs from Los Angeles to Las Vegas; another gas line runs from the Bay Area to Reno, and a third runs from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas.

In 2019, the fuel line that runs between the Bay Area and Reno was shut down as wildfires burned in California; in 2023, Gov. Joe Lombardo declared a state of emergency when the pipeline between Las Vegas and Los Angeles (which also serves Nellis and Edwards Air Force bases and McCarran International Airport) was temporarily shut down.

Earlier this year, the CalNev pipeline was again temporarily shut off because of wildfires.

Interspersed with the disruptions, California has passed multiple pieces of legislation targeting the oil industry, including creating an independent watchdog to monitor oil companies for price gouging; passing an electric vehicle mandate to eliminate the sale of new, gasoline-powered vehicles (which has since been blocked by the Republican-led U.S. Senate ); and authorizing state energy regulators to require refineries to maintain a minimum inventory of fuel.

Lombardo, a Republican, and Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs in 2024 jointly penned a letter to California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, expressing the need for “bipartisan, regional communication” when it came to California passing legislation that could have ripple effects on Western fuel supplies.

Four decades ago, more than 40 refineries operated in California. Now, the state is on pace to have just seven by the end of 2026 because of high operating and regulatory compliance costs, the political environment, conversions to bio and renewable fuels, and various state directives, Mische wrote in a paper.

Some companies have consolidated while others have focused on production at more efficient facilities — but the reduction has shrunk the state’s refining capacity from 2.38 million barrels of oil per day to 1.64 million barrels.

The closures, though, are aligning with California’s initiatives to reduce driving and lower carbon emissions. While California’s population was 6% higher in 2024 than in 2010, gasoline sales were 5% lower, said Elliott Parker, professor and economics chair at UNR.

“In a sense, the California policy is working to make gas more expensive to get people to switch to electric vehicles and hybrid cars,” he said.

‘Scary for consumers’

With the refinery closures, some experts are forecasting price spikes as high as $8 per gallon — others are projecting more modest increases under $1.50 per gallon.

Nevadans already pay well over the national average because of its reliance on California fuel, which consistently ranks among the most expensive for gas. As the national average for a gallon of gas dipped below $3 for the first time in four years in December, Nevadans continued to pay 75 cents to $1 more.

Nevada gets the remainder of its fuel from Utah, where at least one lawmaker is floating a bill for the state’s 2026 legislative session that would reassess its gas tax structure by shifting the levy onto fuel exports, such as the gas that makes its way into Nevada.

Nevada is “in a very vulnerable situation,” said Michael Mische, a University of Southern California associate professor and industry expert.

Sinclair Gas has announced potential expansions into Nevada, but any pipeline and infrastructure construction would take time. By next summer, Nevadans are likely to start feeling pain at the pump, said Miranda Hoover, state executive for the Energy and Convenience Association of Nevada, a trade association that represents liquid fuel and lubricant distributors, transporters, retailers and convenience store owners.

“It’s very scary for consumers, businesses (and) families working on a tight budget,” she said.

Low-income households and small businesses, which already spend a higher share of income on transportation and often have limited ability to reduce driving or absorb sudden cost increases, are hit first and hardest by price spikes, Caitlin Gatchalian, Nevada representative at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, wrote in an email.

“The refinery closures in California expose a real vulnerability in Nevada’s transportation fuel system,” wrote Gatchalian, whose group advocates for clean energy and transportation. “People and goods still need to move.”

Governor braces for impact

The newly created fuel resiliency subcommittee will explore options to expand infrastructure and storage, recommend policies for emergency response and coordinate with other agencies to accelerate permitting for critical infrastructure projects. Its first meeting is expected this month.

Oil production within the state, however, is unlikely to increase. Nevada lacks substantial crude oil reserves. In 1990, the state reached a high, producing more than 4 million barrels of oil, but that amount has steadily declined. Last year, Nevada produced around 170,000 barrels, a blip in the national production of well over 13 million barrels of oil per day.

Citing threats to homeland security if fuel supplies to first responders and transportation hubs are compromised, Lombardo’s office has said it’s critical the state take a proactive approach.

“Energy security touches every part of daily life, and waiting until fuel disruptions are visible to the public is already too late,” Chase McNamara, the governor’s policy adviser on natural resources, told The Nevada Independent.

McNamara did not elaborate on who will serve on the subcommittee, but did say it could include somewhere between 10 and 20 appointments.

Meanwhile, Sinclair Gas has announced it is evaluating a multiphased expansion across Western fuel markets, particularly in Nevada and California, that would supply as many as 150,000 barrels per day. The first phase, which includes “debottlenecking” its pipeline from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas, would move a projected 35,000 barrels per day from the Rockies into Nevada with a target operational date of 2028.

If the project comes online in time and can deliver its target amounts of oil, that would go a long way toward alleviating Nevada’s issues, Mische said.

Sinclair has also floated the idea of building a new lateral pipeline from Salt Lake City to Reno, and a pipeline expansion between Texas and Phoenix could benefit Nevada as major oil companies consider a pipeline between Phoenix and Las Vegas, Hoover said.

“We are looking at any and all options,” she said, including “planning for the future of energy diversification in the state where we don’t run into this again.”

Parker, the UNR economist, questioned if Nevada’s government has the clout to sway what happens outside the state. With one-tenth the population of California, “I don’t think there’s much Nevada can do,” he said. “We’re a small part of the market.”

The bigger question, he said, is what California wants to do.

“Does California want to intervene to try to increase refinery capacity or do they want to say ‘Yeah, it’s kind of a good thing to have higher prices?’” he asked.

About Vistra Vistra (NYSE: VST) is a leading, Fortune 500 integrated retail electricity and power generation company based in Irving, Texas, that provides essential resources to customers, businesses, and communities from California to Maine.","Highlights

Acquisition of Cogentrix includes ~5,500 megawatts of modern natural gas generation assets at an attractive purchase price, net of expected tax benefits, of approximately $730/kW of capacity.

Acquisition is expected to deliver mid-single digit Ongoing Operations AFCFbG1 per share accretion in 2027 and high single-digit accretion on average over 2027-2029.

Reiterating previously communicated capital allocation plan, including long-term net leverage target of less than 3x2, the expected return of capital to shareholders by way of the planned $300 million in annual dividends, and at least $1 billion of share repurchases each year.

IRVING, Texas, Jan. 5, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Vistra Corp. (NYSE: VST) today announced it has executed definitive agreements to acquire Cogentrix Energy, consisting of 10 modern natural gas generation facilities totaling approximately 5,500 MW of capacity. Cogentrix is indirectly owned by funds managed by Quantum Capital Group. The acquisition includes three combined cycle gas turbine facilities and two combustion turbine facilities located across PJM, four combined cycle gas turbine facilities in ISO New England, and one cogeneration facility in ERCOT.

Vistra will acquire these assets at a net purchase price of approximately $4.0 billion, which is comprised of the payment of approximately $2.3 billion of cash consideration and approximately $0.9 billion of Vistra stock consideration (5 million shares of common stock at a mutually agreed-upon value of $185 per share) to be issued to Quantum, and the assumption of approximately $1.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness at Cogentrix, less approximately $0.7 billion of net present value of expected tax benefits generated directly as a result of the transaction. The consideration payable is also subject to certain customary net working capital, cash, and indebtedness adjustments. The approximately $4.0 billion net purchase price implies a multiple of approximately 7.25x the 2027 expected Adjusted EBITDA contribution and approximately $730/kW for the portfolio.

""The Vistra team is excited to announce the acquisition of the Cogentrix portfolio, marking the second opportunistic expansion of our generation footprint over the past year to support our ability to serve growing customer demand in our key markets,"" said Vistra President and CEO Jim Burke. ""Successfully integrating and operating generation assets is a major undertaking, and our talented team continues to demonstrate that it is a core competency of our company.""

Burke continued, ""Our diversified fleet, anchored on natural gas and nuclear generation, will play a critical role in the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of U.S. power grids. The addition of this natural gas portfolio is a great way to start another year of growth for Vistra as we've completed, acquired, or developed projects in each of the competitive power regions where we operate. Vistra continues to look for opportunities that allow us to meet the growing demand of customers and meet our disciplined investment thresholds. We look forward to closing the transaction and welcoming new team members to the Vistra family.""

""We are pleased to have reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the Cogentrix portfolio to Vistra,"" said Wil VanLoh, Founder and CEO of Quantum Capital Group. ""We are excited to become shareholders of Vistra and have much confidence in Vistra's ability to deliver long-term value through its industry-leading portfolio and operational excellence. Quantum thanks the Cogentrix team for their partnership and looks forward to seeing the business continue to grow as part of Vistra.""

Acquisition of Cogentrix Portfolio

Portfolio Overview

Strategic Rationale

Adds Attractive Portfolio of Modern and Efficient Natural Gas Assets: Cogentrix portfolio is composed of a modern and efficient set of gas assets that adds baseload-weighted capacity, complements Vistra's fleet, and enhances Vistra's efficient generation capabilities. The portfolio has an average heat rate of approximately 7,800 Btu / kWh and features the Patriot and Hamilton-Liberty plants, which are 2016 COD facilities with sub 7,000 Btu / kWh heat rates.

Expands Integrated Fleet in Key Regions: Acquisition diversifies and expands Vistra's geographic footprint by adding 5,500 MW of net capacity across some of the most attractive and fastest-growing power regions in North America: PJM, ISO New England, and ERCOT. Combined with our current fleet, Vistra's generation portfolio will consist of approximately 50,000 MW of capacity across the US.

Fully Aligns with Vistra's Disciplined Approach to Capital Allocation: Acquisition expected to deliver immediate benefits to Vistra shareholders, including Ongoing Operations AFCFbG1 per share accretion in the mid-single digits in 2027 and high single-digit accretion on average over 2027-2029, driven by an attractive cash flow generation profile of the Cogentrix portfolio and expected tax benefits generated directly as a result of the transaction. Vistra expects the transaction to exceed its mid-teens levered return target.

Maintains Strength and Resilience of Vistra's Balance Sheet: Equity consideration reflects Vistra's commitment to continuing the execution of its disciplined capital allocation plan and to a strong balance sheet, including investment grade credit ratings.

Conditions and Timing

Five and a half months. That’s all the time Donald Trump needed to crush the only major climate law the United States ever managed to pass. It was swift work, using a sledgehammer and not a scalpel, and now the energy transition will have to make do with the fragments of the law that remain.

The words bleak and dispiriting come to mind. How else to describe the fact that the U.S. entered the year implementing an ambitious if inadequate decarbonization law, and is now exiting 2025 with that law all but repealed?

But there were also some reasons to be hopeful about the energy transition this year—if you knew where to look.

Let’s start with the numbers. During a year full of headline-grabbing destruction of U.S. clean energy policy, renewables still led the way. Through November, a whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity built in the U.S. came in the form of solar, batteries, and wind power. Electric vehicle sales hit a record, too—nearly 440,000 in the third quarter of the year—though the surge was driven in large part by consumers rushing to buy EVs before the disappearance of a federal tax credit axed by Trump.

There were also intriguing moments of alignment between Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and the transition away from fossil fuels. Geothermal and nuclear are two sources of carbon-free energy that the administration has, for whatever reasons, deemed desirable. So while the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eviscerated much of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, it spared tax credits for geothermal systems. And Trump has not only preserved Biden-era funding for nuclear projects but expanded it—possibly by orders of magnitude if an $80-billion plan for partially state-owned nuclear reactors actually happens.

The most important thing we saw this year is that Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition. Sure, he can slow it. He already has. But try as the administration might, there are forces at play bigger and more stubborn even than politics.

To be specific: Electricity demand is growing quickly in the U.S., and clean energy is the least expensive and most readily available way to keep pace.

The Trump administration would certainly prefer to meet rising demand with coal and gas, but in many cases it’s simply impractical.

Coal is increasingly the most expensive form of electricity. Gas, for better or for worse, certainly will help meet some of this new demand—but it faces very real supply chain constraints. Gas turbines are sold out among major manufacturers, with wait times stretching as long as seven years.

When the country is clamouring for more electrons and voters are increasingly upset about rising power bills, and the only thing that can be built quickly is solar and storage, renewables will simply have to be built. (They’ll just cost more than they would have without Trump.)

So while it hasn’t been a good year for clean energy in the U.S., the transition now has enough momentum that even a terrible year amounts to more of a slowdown than a derailment. It’s a matter of inertia.

Why Colorado Strongly Supports Electric Vehicles

Colorado’s EV incentives are part of a broader strategy to reduce air pollution, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and improve public health. Transportation is one of the largest contributors to carbon emissions in the state, especially along the Front Range urban corridor.

By offering financial incentives, Colorado encourages residents to:

Switch from gasoline vehicles to EVs

Install home and workplace charging stations

Support clean energy jobs and innovation

The result is a growing EV ecosystem that benefits drivers, businesses, and the environment.

Overview of Colorado State EV Incentives

Colorado provides incentives at multiple levels, including:

State income tax credits for EV purchases and leases

Rebates for electric motorcycles and e-bikes

Charging infrastructure incentives for homes and businesses

Utility company rebates and discounted charging rates

These programs can often be combined with federal incentives, making Colorado one of the most cost-effective states for EV ownership.

Read more:

How Colorado Incentives Compare With Federal EV Credits

In addition to state benefits, buyers may qualify for the federal clean vehicle tax credit administered by the Internal Revenue Service.

Key differences between state and federal credits

Because Colorado does not impose income or vehicle price caps, many buyers who are excluded from the federal credit still qualify for the state incentive.

Colorado Incentives for Used Electric Vehicles

Unlike some states, Colorado’s primary tax credit focuses on new vehicles. However, used EV buyers can still benefit indirectly through:

Lower purchase prices due to higher resale demand

Utility rebates for home charging

Local city or county programs

Some low-income assistance programs may also apply depending on location.

Electric Motorcycle and E-Bike Incentives in Colorado

Colorado also promotes smaller electric mobility options, which are ideal for urban commuting.

Electric motorcycle incentives

Qualifying electric motorcycles may receive a state tax credit

Credit amount depends on battery capacity and vehicle classification

E-bike tax credits

Colorado offers a refundable e-bike tax credit

Applies to residents purchasing qualifying electric bicycles

Colorado E-Bike Credit Overview

This program makes Colorado one of the most progressive states for micromobility incentives.

Home EV Charging Incentives in Colorado

Owning an EV is much easier with a home charging station. Colorado supports home charging through both state and utility-level programs.

State-level benefits

Charging equipment may qualify for sales tax exemptions

Installation costs can sometimes be included in broader energy programs

Examples of utility incentives

These rebates reduce upfront installation costs and encourage off-peak charging.

Public and Workplace Charging Incentives

Colorado understands that charging access is critical for EV adoption, especially for renters and businesses.

Incentives for businesses and property owners

Grants for installing workplace charging

Rebates for multifamily housing charging stations

Support for fleet electrification

Charging infrastructure grants

These programs help expand charging access across urban and rural areas.

Local EV Incentives in Colorado Cities

In addition to statewide programs, many cities and counties offer local EV incentives.

Common local benefits

Reduced vehicle registration fees

Preferred parking for EVs

Local rebates for chargers

Cities like Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins are particularly active in promoting electric mobility.

How to Claim Colorado EV Incentives

Claiming incentives correctly is essential to avoid delays or rejection.

Steps to claim the Colorado EV tax credit

Purchase or lease a qualifying EV

Register the vehicle in Colorado

Keep purchase and registration documents

File your Colorado income tax return

Complete the required EV credit form

It is recommended to consult a tax professional if you are unsure about eligibility or documentation.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

Many buyers miss out on incentives due to simple errors.

Avoid these mistakes

Buying a vehicle that does not qualify

Missing filing deadlines

Not keeping proof of purchase

Assuming dealer discounts replace tax credits

Being informed ensures you receive the full benefit.

Impact of EV Incentives on Total Ownership Cost

Colorado’s incentives significantly reduce the lifetime cost of owning an EV.

Cost comparison example

Over time, EV owners in Colorado often save thousands of dollars.

Environmental and Economic Benefits for Colorado

EV incentives do more than help individual buyers.

Statewide benefits

Improved air quality

Reduced healthcare costs

Growth in clean energy jobs

Reduced dependence on fossil fuels

These long-term gains justify continued investment in EV programs.

Rural America, the manufacturing heartland, benefited from job growth in 2022 and 2023.
This was a rare advantage for rural places with low quality of life.
But, despite what many believe, the geography of those cuts is dominated by rural places.
The deepest cuts come to Medicaid and other anti-poverty programs that see their heaviest use in rural places.","Michael J.

Small towns are in for a sobering stretch of economic challenges as elected officials reverse pandemic-era policies that had been reviving them.

COVID-19 was a huge, unexpected opportunity for rural America. The pandemic brought jobs and people to places that had been in decline.

One reason is the pandemic brought a sharp shift in household consumption toward goods and away from services. Rural America, the manufacturing heartland, benefited from job growth in 2022 and 2023. That growth slowed by 2024, but legislation like Sen. Todd Young’s CHIPS Act offered at least a hint that we might be entering a period of more stable factory employment.

Unlike most of the world, the U.S. economy boomed after COVID. The effects were particularly obvious in labor markets, pushing us down to the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment since the 1960s. This attracted immigrants — legal and illegal — many of whom came to rural America for economic opportunity.

This was a rare advantage for rural places with low quality of life. Economic migrants are driven more by good-paying jobs than luxuries such as walkable neighborhoods or nationally ranked schools. As was the case during the 19th and early-20th centuries, immigrants moved to places native-born Americans were fleeing.

Immigration became a once-in-a-century opportunity for rural places facing the deepest economic decline.

The pandemic also brought opportunities to rural places with high quality of life and small job markets. That’s because COVID accelerated remote work, severing the geographic ties between homes and offices and permitting families to choose rural communities while keeping their jobs.

New businesses also grew during the pandemic, bringing an excess supply of college-educated workers.

Meanwhile, rural America continued to benefit from tax policies, both federal and state. Rural Americans are older, poorer and face higher rates of disability. They pay less taxes and collect more benefits than their urban or suburban counterparts.

Indiana’s poorest rural county receives about $16,000 more per year in per-capita federal transfer payments than it pays (see https://jrap.scholasticahq.com/article/127868-federal-fiscal-exposure-of-us-counties). That same county receives $1,500 more per resident in state taxes than it pays (https://indianafiscalpolicyinstitute.wildapricot.org/resources/Documents/IFPI INTRASTATE DISTRIBUTION 2025.pdf).

Along with this, place-based economic policies favored rural counties. For example, child care tax credits, a popular state policy, did more to allow rural families to work than almost any other policy in the past half-century.

Taken together, these policies and economic realities offered rural America a brighter future. Today, everything I’ve just mentioned is at risk, or gone entirely.

The Trump administration has ended remote work for federal workers. Many states, including Indiana, have followed suit for state workers. That directly hurts rural America.

Tariffs and the trade war have reversed manufacturing employment and production. They are also eviscerating agricultural exports. Job growth effectively stopped in April. The deepest job losses are just now settling into rural America, with losses clustered in manufacturing, logistics and agriculture.

Immigration has also stopped, and with it the prospects of population growth for about two-thirds of rural counties. This loss of new families means employers won’t consider these places — they need workers. Schools will shrink, churches will lose congregants and decline will accelerate.

Federal funding will slow under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. That’s unsurprising and inevitable given our large federal debt. But, despite what many believe, the geography of those cuts is dominated by rural places.

The deepest cuts come to Medicaid and other anti-poverty programs that see their heaviest use in rural places. This will lead to the closure of a number of rural hospitals across the country by 2030, as they rely so heavily on this support.

There’s little disagreement on the magnitude of these effects in Washington, D.C., and statehouses across the country. But rural Americans voted so overwhelmingly for the GOP that neither party has much incentive to address these problems.

And so, they will come to pass until the 1 in 5 Americans who live in rural places decide the current policy environment is robbing them of a prosperous future.-30-",,N,,2026-01-06 00:12:28.641638

Legislation that would fund cybersecurity programs for electricity and water systems and help police departments fight cyber crime is scheduled for House consideration this week.

The House and Senate Appropriations Committees today released the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026 (HR __, 119th Cong. (2026)).

The legislation, a so-called minibus, combines three fiscal year (FY) 2026 appropriations bills into one. It has been pre-conferenced by House and Senate appropriators and is set for consideration by the House Rules Committee tomorrow at 6:45 p.m. in Room H-313 of the Capitol.

The minibus would provide $5 million “for local law enforcement grants for prevention, enforcement, and prosecution of cybercrimes against individuals,” according to its text.

The cyber crime grant program, to be administered by the Department of Justice through a new National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals, would focus on crimes such as extortion rather than crimes targeting businesses or government agencies, DoJ indicated.

The Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) would receive $190 million, a $10 million reduction from the office’s FY 2025 enacted level but $40 million more than the department requested, according to a report from the committees.

Of that amount, $1 million would go to CESER’s Energy Threat Analysis Center to “support the cybersecurity of rural energy infrastructure” and outreach to “small rural utilities and communities,” the report says.

A separate report indicates that the Environmental Protection Agency would receive $10 million for efforts to help water and wastewater systems improve their cyber defenses, which is a new spending category for EPA in FY 2026.

“This is a fiscally responsible package that restrains spending while providing essential federal investments that will improve water infrastructure in our country, enhance our nation’s energy and national security, and spur scientific research necessary to maintain U.S. competitiveness,” Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a news release announcing the minibus.

Congress has until Jan. 30 to adopt FY 2026 appropriations bills or enact another stop-gap spending bill like it did last November to end a government shutdown (CPR, Nov. 13, 2025 ).

AMERMIN said the project will support more efficient, lower-cost production of virgin-quality tungsten carbide powder from reclaimed feedstock, targeting applications tied to national security and everyday industrial demand.
CEO Ryan McAdams said the funding will allow AMERMIN to increase tungsten carbide output by 300% by expanding its tungsten carbide reclamation facility.
The company cited the concentration of global tungsten supply as a key vulnerability, noting that a large share of production is sourced abroad.

The Austin, Texas-based company positions the award as a step toward strengthening U.S. supply chain resilience and reducing dependence on foreign-sourced materials that are used across defense, energy, aerospace, construction, healthcare, technology, and other industrial sectors. AMERMIN said the project will support more efficient, lower-cost production of virgin-quality tungsten carbide powder from reclaimed feedstock, targeting applications tied to national security and everyday industrial demand.

CEO Ryan McAdams said the funding will allow AMERMIN to increase tungsten carbide output by 300% by expanding its tungsten carbide reclamation facility. The company cited the concentration of global tungsten supply as a key vulnerability, noting that a large share of production is sourced abroad.

AMERMIN’s model centers on recovering materials from “end of life” waste streams and returning them to manufacturing specifications to extend life cycles. Beyond tungsten, the company says it works across a portfolio that includes copper, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and other critical inputs.

The grant was awarded to MELT Technologies, L.P., which does business as AMERMIN, described as an asset recovery and processing business. AMERMIN is also described as a sister company to Drill Bit Exchange, which focuses on asset recovery solutions for the drill bit industry.

Founded in 2017, AMERMIN has been expanding its operational footprint in Texas. The company said the grant will help scale operations at its nearly 80-acre campus under construction in Briggs, Texas, with the broader expansion expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2026.

Texas lawmakers tied the award to both national security and regional economic benefits, emphasizing the role of domestic critical materials production in supporting American manufacturing and energy supply chains.

KEY QUOTES

“We appreciate the DOE’s confidence in AMERMIN to establish a reliable domestic source of critical materials and minerals, addressing important supply chain and national security issues. This funding will enable AMERMIN to increase the output of tungsten carbide by 300 percent through the expansion of our state-of-the-art tungsten carbide reclamation facility, reducing our country’s reliance on foreign nations like China, which produces 83% of the world’s tungsten supply. We know that America’s future depends on access to critical materials, and together we are charting a new path in American innovation.”

Ryan McAdams, CEO, AMERMIN

“Texas companies continue to develop technologies that enhance our lives and strengthen national security. This significant $11.5 million federal investment in Texas-born AMERMIN, located in the heart of my district, is a testament to the important work the company is doing to increase American manufacturing independence and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers for critical materials and minerals that are important to nearly every industry.”

Representative John Carter (TX-31)

“I am thrilled that AMERMIN was selected and approved by the U.S. Department of Energy to increase its production of critical minerals, directly aiding American oil and gas producers. Our country cannot afford to rely on our adversaries for the resources that power our energy industry. This investment strengthens our district’s role in American energy leadership while providing good paying jobs to Texas families.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2026/01/AMERMIN-Logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 03:58:41.922813

The agency had already cut more than 3,700 EPA employees in the first seven months of Trump’s second term.
Boom credits the “sustained advocacy” of the many environmental experts at EPN who urged Congress to adopt the bipartisan Senate approach and halt the relentless assault on the EPA.
“EPN volunteers will continue to press Congress to finish the job of ensuring EPA is fully resourced, accountable and able to carry out its proper mission of protecting the American people,” Boom said.","In a step toward heading off a government shutdown when a temporary funding agreement expires at the end of January, appropriators in both the Senate and House of Representatives released a bipartisan spending package Monday morning that kept the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency largely intact.

The spending package would fund several federal agencies and scientific bodies, including the EPA, departments of Interior and Energy and the National Science Foundation through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

The “minibus” bills, which will likely move to the House floor for a vote this week, allocated more than $38 billion to Interior, Environment and related agencies, or $9.5 billion more than the Trump administration’s budget request.

“This legislation is a forceful rejection of draconian cuts to public services proposed by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, in a statement.

“The bill prioritizes unleashing American energy, ensuring access to public lands, promoting the reversal of harmful Biden-era rulemakings that have hamstrung farmers and industries and rightsizing agency funding levels, including a $320 million reduction to the Environmental Protection Agency,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., chair of the House Appropriations Committee, in a statement outlining key provisions of the package.

The package allocated $8.8 billion for the EPA, roughly 4 percent less than last year’s $9 billion budget for the agency, a far less drastic reduction than environmental advocates had feared.

Both DeLauro and Cole noted the lack of “poison pills” in the package, referring to policy provisions added by opponents of a bill designed to sabotage its passage.

“This bill blocks the worst cuts and policy riders to EPA and shows Congress getting back to its job by passing bipartisan bills rather than relying on short-term stopgaps,” said Marc Boom, senior director of public affairs for the nonprofit Environmental Protection Network (EPN), in a statement. The group is made up of more than 700 former EPA employees.

Before Congress adjourned for the holiday recess in December, former EPA staffers led by EPN urged legislators to adopt the Senate’s bipartisan approach to funding the nation’s environmental regulators to halt what they called the dismantling of protections for Americans’ health.

The bipartisan Senate bill had negotiated a 5 percent budget reduction. The House, by contrast, had originally proposed a 23 percent cut, which was less severe than the Trump administration’s proposed 55 percent reduction but deep enough to hobble the agency’s core enforcement and research duties, warned experts with EPN.

Democratic members of the Senate Appropriations Committee said the package of funding bills rejects “draconian” cuts and policies pushed by President Trump and House Republicans, and reasserts congressional control over key funding decisions, in a statement Monday.

The bill is a notable step in the right direction, said Boom, “but it doesn’t yet undo the damage to EPA’s capacity to protect public health or prevent further destructive actions by Administrator [Lee] Zeldin.”

In July, the EPA announced staff cuts and “organizational improvements” affecting the Office of Research and Development (ORD) it said would save $748.8 million. The agency had already cut more than 3,700 EPA employees in the first seven months of Trump’s second term.

“Science is really foundational to EPA in its ability to achieve its mission, and now it’s at risk,” said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, a former principal deputy assistant administrator with ORD, at an EPN briefing last month. “Dismantling EPA’s Office of Research and Development would devastate the agency’s ability to protect us from legacy pollution and emerging threats,” said Orme-Zavaleta, who spent 40 years at the agency.

The administration already dismantled the Board of Scientific Counselors for ORD, Orme-Zavaleta told Inside Climate News, referring to the independent federal advisory committee established in 1996 to support the office’s research.

ORD once had more than 1,5o0 employees but now just 140 are left, she said. “There remains a lot of uncertainty about whether the agency is going to take the final step and dismantle the whole thing, or are they waiting to see how the budget plays out?”

It’s also unclear whether Colorado’s Democratic senators will support the package, after the Trump administration threatened to close the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a global leader in climate and earth science based in Boulder, and then vetoed a bill to fund a drinking water pipeline in the state.

Boom credits the “sustained advocacy” of the many environmental experts at EPN who urged Congress to adopt the bipartisan Senate approach and halt the relentless assault on the EPA. But the EPA’s budget remains historically low when adjusted for inflation, continuing a decade-long erosion of the agency’s capacity as its responsibilities have grown, he said.

Compromise Bill Rejects Extreme Cuts to EPA but More Needed to Protect Public Health

Washington D.C. – Today, House and Senate appropriators released a new compromise appropriations package which included the FY26 funding bill for the EPA.

This compromise EPA budget legislation delivers important progress by rejecting the most extreme cuts proposed by the Administration and House Republicans, blocking many harmful policy riders, and reflecting the leadership of Senate appropriators whose bipartisan work helped set expectations for the continuation of EPA’s original mission.

“This bill blocks the worst cuts and policy riders to EPA and shows Congress getting back to its job by passing bipartisan bills rather than relying on short-term stopgaps,” said Marc Boom, Senior Director of Public Affairs at EPN. “It’s a notable step in the right direction, but it doesn’t yet undo the damage to EPA’s capacity to protect public health or prevent further destructive actions by Administrator Zeldin.”

Congress will still need to do more to hold EPA accountable to work for the American people rather than big corporate polluters. Even with this agreement, EPA’s budget remains historically low when adjusted for inflation, continuing a decade-long erosion of the agency’s capacity as its responsibilities have grown. This chart, prepared by EPN staff, illustrates the issue.

The progress found in this bill follows sustained advocacy by former EPA leaders, policy experts and volunteers with the Environmental Protection Network, who urged Congress to reject deep cuts and instead adopt the bipartisan Senate approach. After what EPN has described as “a year of serial shutdown inside EPA,” EPN volunteers will continue to press Congress to finish the job of ensuring EPA is fully resourced, accountable, and able to carry out its proper mission of protecting the American people.

And for good reason: It’s where the country’s first school of forestry was established, by Dr. Carl Alwin Schenck, a German forester.
In 1968, Congress officially designated 6,500 acres of this land as the Cradle of Forestry in America National Historic Site to commemorate Schenck’s contributions.

He notes that some of the artifacts of the forestry school did some traveling themselves.","The Cradle of Forestry, located within North Carolina's Pisgah National Forest, is the historical epicenter of professional forest management in the United States. And for good reason: It’s where the country’s first school of forestry was established, by Dr. Carl Alwin Schenck, a German forester.

Schenck was hired in 1895 by George Washington Vanderbilt II, the owner of Biltmore outside of Asheville, to bring a rigorous European scientific approach to the Appalachian wilderness. He inherited land scarred by years of indiscriminate logging and focused on a dual mission: restoration and economic viability. Schenck believed that ""forestry is best which pays best,"" arguing that for conservation to succeed long-term, it had to be a profitable business model. (Later in life, he said that “forestry is a good thing but love is better.”)

Faced with a lack of trained professionals to manage Vanderbilt’s vast holdings, Schenck founded the Biltmore Forest School in 1898, offering a one-year intensive course that emphasized fieldwork over traditional classroom study. His students, often living in rustic cabins, spent their mornings in lectures and their afternoons performing hands-on labor: planting seedlings, felling timber, and managing nurseries. Until it closed in 1913, the school produced more than 300 graduates who became the pioneers of the burgeoning U.S. Forest Service and private timber industry.

In 1968, Congress officially designated 6,500 acres of this land as the Cradle of Forestry in America National Historic Site to commemorate Schenck’s contributions.

Today, the site remains a vibrant hub for conservation education, and it is now operated by FIND Outside, a national nonprofit that runs outdoor parks in North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky. The Biltmore Campus Trail consists of 3 miles of paved trails that give an idea of what life would have been like for a forestry student in that time period. Another trail provides examples of logging technology from the early 1900s, including a 1914 Climax locomotive. And a museum called the Discovery Center enables visitors to learn about what forest management entails: from soil science to hydrology to silviculture—the growth and cultivation of trees.

Clinton Wickers, the site manager for the Cradle of Forestry, says that FIND Outside has been in partnership with the Forest Service for more than 50 years. He notes that some of the artifacts of the forestry school did some traveling themselves.

“There are actual wood slabs that Gifford Pinchot [Schenck’s predecessor at the Biltmore property] took to the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, and they're all samples of trees from North Carolina,"" he says. Interactive features that visitors can experience at the Discovery Center include a helicopter simulator: ""Folks can sit in the cockpit of the helicopter and watch a film, and kind of it moves as if the blades are changing, and people can see what it would be like to be a part of a firefighting crew.”",https://img.atlasobscura.com/XDis-iPLYGHFcntBgpehm5A0s2FlMfMt-my-lKJ9r-o/rt:fit/w:600/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy9hNjU5/YmE2Ni0wOTZjLTQ4/NjktOTQ0OS1hMjE0/N2JjZTIwZGYyOWE2/OTU2OTFmNjZlMWU3/OTFfQ3JhZGxlIG9m/IEZvcmVzdHJ5IE5D/UE4gUGF2ZWQgV2Fs/a2luZyBQYXRoIFRo/cm91Z2ggRm9yZXN0/IDI2Mi5qcGc.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 21:12:53.564109

State: Flags to be at half-staff on day of fire chief's funeral, burial service

Since the start of 2025, just under $540 million in federal climate grants have been cancelled, impacting a total of seven programs.

""The most significant grant canceled in that bucket is Michigan solar for all grants,"" Annabelle Rosser, senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, said.

That program would have support solar development for thousands of households in low-income and disadvantaged communities through direct financial assistance for rooftop solar, community solar, energy storage and enabling upgrades.

The single-biggest cancellation, $170 million, was set aside to help Kraft Heinz could make their facilities more efficient.

That was a multi-state project, but cities like Mt. Pleasant and Grand Rapids also saw grants cancelled, according to an Atlas analysis.

""The vast majority of climate funding that was appropriated or kind of made available by Congress in the last administration, was awarded, and much of it was obligated, by the end of 2024,"" Rosser said. ""Then, in 2025, we saw a pretty significant cutback and basically a cancellation of a lot of the obligated grants.""

It wasn't just grants that were impacted, however. In the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" passed last year, green tax credits were cut. Ultimately, $3 billion in planned green investments were cancelled in 2025.

""There's still some investment moving forward in the state,"" Rosser said. ""There's like a pretty significant drop off and a rollback of some of those investments that will lead to job losses and economic losses in the state.""

Trump has railed against clean energy projects, calling them the ""green new scam.""

The Energy Department, which awarded the grants under the Biden administration, now says many of the projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a return on investment.

Supporters of green energy disagree.

""These cancelations are counterproductive,"" Bentley Johnson, federal government affairs Director at the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said. ""They're making energy bills, which are already really high for Michiganders, continue to go up, and they're a missed opportunity to help support our communities.""

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent notice Dec. 31 to Panther Operating Co. of Houston that it has proposed a $9.62 million fine for the failure of its Main Pass Oil Gathering pipeline system. An estimated 1.1 million gallons of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico when a connector on the pipeline malfunctioned, allowing oil to flow for more than nine hours, according to the agency. The leak was visible nearly 20 miles off the Mississippi River Delta.

Panther Operating Co., a subsidiary of Third Coast infrastructure, has 30 days to respond to the notice to explain how it will address the leak, contest the allegations or request a formal administrative hearing. Company representatives did not respond immediately to a request for comment Monday.

According to the notice, a Panther controller was aware of the leak at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 15 based on pressure gauge observations and noted a zero flow rate for the pipeline five hours later. However, the controller did not order the pipeline shut down before his shift ended the next morning at 6:00. His replacement called for it to be closed around 6:30 a.m., which was 13 hours after the pressure issues were first noted, the agency said.

“These factors have the potential to improve both the efficiency of capacity auction outcomes and the ability of the market to meet its resource adequacy objective,” ISO-NE said.
So far, there hasn’t been significant data center development in New England, but that could change, according to the grid operator.
“Such uncertainty … demands a capacity market design that procures capacity based on the most up-to-date and accurate data regarding supply and demand dynamics,” ISO-NE said.
The proposal received broad stakeholder support and is one part of a broader capacity market reform initiative, according to the grid operator.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

ISO New England aims to overhaul its capacity auction process by buying capacity a month ahead of time instead of three years in advance, according to a proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Dec. 30.

The proposal to switch to a “prompt” capacity auction framework in June 2028 would bring a range of benefits to New England, including making its load forecasts and other key inputs used to set the auction’s parameters more accurate, according to the grid operator.

In a change from current practice, the capacity auction would only be open to existing resources.

“These factors have the potential to improve both the efficiency of capacity auction outcomes and the ability of the market to meet its resource adequacy objective,” ISO-NE said.

Partly, the proposal aims to address uncertainty about New England’s future resource needs, according to ISO-NE.

Driven by home and vehicle electrification, ISO-NE expects its reserve margin will fall from 15% in 2029 to 8% in 2034, the grid operator said. However, that forecast may be overstated after the 2025 budget bill ended federal tax credits for electric vehicles, ISO-NE said.

So far, there hasn’t been significant data center development in New England, but that could change, according to the grid operator.

“Such uncertainty … demands a capacity market design that procures capacity based on the most up-to-date and accurate data regarding supply and demand dynamics,” ISO-NE said.

The proposal also calls for changing ISO-NE’s process for considering power plant retirements. Currently, power plant owners can retire a resource only by submitting a “de-list bid” into the capacity auction four years ahead of a planned retirement. ISO-NE plans to replace that process with a one-year advance notification requirement.

“The reforms to the capacity resource deactivation process will facilitate capacity suppliers’ use of more accurate information about resource and economic conditions before deciding upon whether to proceed with a deactivation — and will also improve the flexibility of deactivated resources to return to the market if conditions so warrant,” ISO-NE said.

The proposal received broad stakeholder support and is one part of a broader capacity market reform initiative, according to the grid operator.

ISO-NE is working with its stakeholders to develop a winter and summer seasonal capacity auction framework instead of its existing annual construct, which sends a price signal reflecting summer peak demand, the grid operator said.

“This will allow the capacity market to send a price signal that reflects the value of resources toward meeting winter demand, as it increases, which, in turn, will provide capacity suppliers with the incentive to ensure resources are capable of performing to meet that demand, by (for example) shoring up fuel supplies and/or installing dual fuel capability,” ISO-NE said.

In the same proposal — set to be filed late this year at FERC — ISO-NE plans to replace its existing summer performance-based capacity accreditation process with requirements that capture the marginal reliability contribution of resources during high reliability risk periods, the grid operator said.

ISO-NE said its proposal will include “novel” provisions that reflect New England’s gas pipeline constraints that can affect the region in the winter.

“The gas constraint will be modeled in the seasonal capacity auction, where it is anticipated to ‘bind’ in the winter auction clearing to reflect the more limited availability of gas during the winter months,” ISO-NE said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/VDqB3VmfC98duXFKZjdi2-6S0ffKhlbcrw85l8PlZS4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS81NjE4OTU4ODAzX2QxYjAyY2QwY2Jfby5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-05 19:58:27.641998

The funding is aimed at strengthening the U.S. supply of low-enriched uranium, the fuel used in most of the country’s nuclear reactors, and getting a jumpstart on domestic production of high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, a newer fuel needed for advanced nuclear reactors that are still under development.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the investment supports President Donald Trump’s push to improve energy security and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly Russia, which currently dominates the global HALEU market, according to Reuters.

But Trump administration officials argued the measures were needed to correct policy interventions by the Biden administration.","President Donald Trump’s pledge to rebuild Venezuela’s decaying oil infrastructure means Chevron, Exxon Mobil and other U.S. energy giants are on the spot: Is it worth the multibillion-dollar investment, not to mention the political drama?

For weeks, Trump has been courting oil companies, promising them a glorious return to Venezuela — home to the world’s largest oil reserves — after the South American country’s authoritarian regime seized private assets decades ago in its push to nationalize the petroleum industry.

Trump’s stunning capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, over the weekend comes as a down payment of sorts to the industry — though not necessarily one that the U.S. oil majors are eager to collect. (Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in a Manhattan courtroom today).

With Maduro out of the picture, “we’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,” Trump said Saturday following the leader’s arrest.

The administration’s pressure campaign amped up today when Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum began scheduling calls with oil company CEOs to urge them to take the plunge, Ben Lefebvre, Zack Colman and James Bikales report.

While oil companies have longed to recover their losses in Venezuela, reestablishing operations in the petrostate — Trump’s condition for repayment — is not so simple, Ben, Zack and James wrote in a story Saturday. Rebuilding decayed oil fields in a still socialist-led country amid a global oil glut is few people’s idea of a good time. And the larger political context is inviting unsavory comparisons to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, an operation that Trump has said “may have been the worst decision” in presidential history.

“We’ve seen what happens when we destabilize countries on behalf of American fossil fuel CEOs: They profit, our service members get hurt or die and regions collapse,” said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). “How do we prevent a civil war from erupting like it did in Iraq?”

It’s likewise unclear how the U.S. would guarantee the safety of employees and equipment, how companies would be paid and whether oil prices will rise enough to make Venezuelan crude profitable.

The glut of crude has driven prices so low that U.S. oil companies are starting to back off some of their production plans in the United States, write Mike Soraghan and Carlos Anchondo.

The International Energy Agency has said there are nearly 2 million extra barrels per day of oil in the global market, or about twice what Venezuela has been supplying.

Venezuela’s oil output has fallen to less than a third of the 3.5 million barrels per day that it produced in the 1970s, and the infrastructure that is used to tap into its 300 billion barrels of reserves has deteriorated in the past two decades. And there are other, more stable South American suppliers, such as those off the coast of Guyana.

Oil, minerals and Trump’s blockbuster Venezuela takeover

Experts say the U.S. takeover of Venezuela — with its oil reserves and vast gold and critical mineral supplies — previews a new foreign policy playbook for the administration that’s focused on access to resources and fending off other global superpowers in the region, write Hannah Northey and Robin Bravender.

“It’s a window into the centrality of resource politics to Trump’s worldview,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton administration Interior Department official.

Trump, atoms, AI and the Texas data center gusher

Fermi America — a startup led by former Texas governor and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Dallas billionaire Toby Neugebauer — is developing what would be the world’s largest private energy grid and artificial intelligence campus, writes Jason Plautz.

But to deliver on the most grandiose of the country’s myriad data center projects, Fermi has to do what no American company has done in decades: build nuclear reactors on time and on budget.

How Trump used emergency powers to help coal

Trump closed out 2025 by flexing emergency powers to keep online coal plants that had been slated for closure and halt the construction of wind projects, writes Benjamin Storrow.

The moves infuriated the president’s critics, who said Trump is using his emergency authority to aid his favored fuel (coal) and hurt technologies he dislikes (wind). But Trump administration officials argued the measures were needed to correct policy interventions by the Biden administration.

Our advocacy focuses on expanding visa programs and reducing barriers for foreign-born workers who play a critical role in long-term care.
The AAPACN Board believes that new services and resources can equip facilities to achieve operational efficiency and care quality.","The nursing home sector in 2026 will be defined by rapid change, leaders said, as payment constraints, workforce shortages and rising expectations from the public and government entities converge.

All the while, operators brace for Medicaid uncertainty and Medicare Advantage growth. Shortened retroactive eligibility periods and potential state-level cuts to Medicaid programs may further contribute to coverage gaps and financial strain, leaders said. Moreover, MA brings lower reimbursement, shorter stays and higher administrative burdens into the new year.

Data-driven decision making and collaboration within communities are emerging as essential strategies to sustain care delivery and quality. Heavy investments in AI will be a critical lever in 2026, helping with lengthy admissions summaries and virtual nursing support in rural settings.

“One truth defines this moment in long-term care: no provider can succeed alone. Financial, regulatory, clinical, workforce and social challenges require integrated solutions,” Deke Cateau, CEO of nonprofit A.G. Rhodes, told Skilled Nursing News. “This is our village approach – a recognition that as a nonprofit, our responsibility extends beyond our walls.”

Overall, collaboration and perception popped up as central themes for 2026. Nursing home operators increasingly view success as dependent on partnerships with universities, hospitals, payers and community organizations; the ability to shift public understanding of long-term care’s complexity and value will be another hurdle with huge rewards if successful.

Skilled Nursing News connected with various sector leaders, from association heads to C-suite executives, to get insights into what’s in store for the nursing home industry in 2026. This article is the first installment in a two-part series, highlighting their thoughts in their own words.

Deke Cateau, CEO, A.G. Rhodes:

Caring for older adults is never static. It is ever changing and always evolving with policy shifts, payment structures, demographic changes and emerging community needs. For A.G. Rhodes, one of Georgia’s oldest nonprofit organizations and a stalwart in the community since 1904, this evolution requires vigilance, adaptability and strong partnerships. This year presents uncertainties, but it also presents tremendous opportunities to strengthen our services to the millions of seniors who call Georgia home.

One of the largest unknowns is the impact of recent Medicaid changes, especially the shortened retroactive approval period. This creates significant pressure on state agencies to process eligibility quickly, so residents do not face gaps in care or coverage. We are preparing for these operational and financial implications while continuing to work closely with state partners to reduce disruption. Georgia’s legislature has increasingly recognized the needs of older adults, and we will continue advocating to ensure seniors remain a clear policy priority.

Payment systems present parallel challenges. Medicare Advantage (MA) growth continues, bringing lower reimbursement, shorter stays and rising administrative demands. Providers are expected to do more with less and produce stronger outcomes with fewer resources and more documentation. In response, A.G. Rhodes is conducting a thorough review of all MA contracts and expanding our internal expertise to negotiate future agreements. Sustainable partnerships demand precision and careful analysis to ensure they support, not compromise, our mission of delivering high-quality care.

The shift to value-based care is accelerating across the sector. In 2026, our focus will not just be on delivering outstanding care, but on proving it through measurable, reliable data. Our longstanding partnerships with Georgia State University and Georgia Tech will be essential as we strengthen analytics, validate outcomes and build evidence around programs such as music therapy and horticultural therapy. These initiatives have demonstrated clear qualitative benefits, particularly for individuals living with dementia. Quantifying those results will allow us to better align with Medicare Advantage plans and other payers seeking proven, data-supported outcomes.

Georgia’s recent adoption of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) adds another important element to the state’s aging-services continuum. PACE helps nursing home eligible individuals remain at home and in their communities. We view PACE not as competition but as a partner. Our goal is to demonstrate quality in ways that position A.G. Rhodes as a trusted referral for short-term stays and rehabilitation. Strengthened partnerships and mission-aligned rate negotiations will be a priority in 2026.

We launched our in-house dialysis programs with DaVita Dialysis two years ago and serve communities with the highest density of end-stage renal disease in the state. The partnership has been incredibly successful, and in 2026 we see opportunities for further expansion to support residents with complex renal needs.

Meanwhile, our Cobb Memory Care Village, which opened in 2024, has now reached stabilized occupancy. The year ahead will focus on evaluating the model’s effectiveness and assessing its replicability across our other A.G. Rhodes homes and beyond. This reflects our commitment to advancing innovative, evidence-informed dementia care across the state and nation.

One truth defines this moment in long-term care: no provider can succeed alone. Financial, regulatory, clinical, workforce and social challenges require integrated solutions. In 2026, A.G. Rhodes will deepen partnerships with universities, hospitals, dialysis providers, PACE programs and other nonprofits. We will formalize collaborations and continue serving as a community resource, accountable to the broader ecosystem of aging services in Georgia.

This is our village approach – a recognition that as a nonprofit, our responsibility extends beyond our walls. We depend on the community, and the community depends on us. Working together is how we ensure equitable, high-quality access to post-acute care for all who need it. I am optimistic about the future we are building together.

Neil Pruitt, CEO, PruittHealth:

It’s our goal to continue our targeted growth strategy, which includes skilled nursing and increasingly assisted living in the markets we serve. Population health management is a key focus for us, and we’ll continue our institutional special needs plan (I-SNP) expansion as well as our dual eligible special needs plan (D-SNP) expansion in the communities we serve.

We’ll also continue our efforts to leverage technology, specifically AI, to make our partners more productive and improve clinical outcomes while expanding private rooms throughout our portfolio.

We will hopefully start construction of two new facilities that will be all private rooms; a facility in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and one near Jacksonville, Florida. We are currently in our second phase of our continuing care retirement community (CCRC) in Raleigh, North Carolina.

That’s a huge focus for us, starting this new CCRC center. We have really focused on our culinary efforts not only at this location but with our assisted living units, all under the guise of our corporate chef who oversees those efforts. We’re trying to up our food and beverage game across the enterprise, while expanding new facilities.

As for PruittHealth’s Medicare Advantage plan, we’ve had record growth in 2025. Our customers see that as a real value add for them to be able to have nurse practitioners and physicians in the facility, enhancing care.

The other item that we’re really excited about is leveraging AI throughout our enterprise to better identify the needs of our better patients, and get a better look at the quality and efficiency of our operations. Like many other industries, we’re seeing a great increase in efficiency and productivity with the use of AI. So that’s really a big initiative that we’re rolling out this year.

For PruittHealth, we’ve seen a big dislocation in the assisted living market. A lot of developers built assisted living but then the pandemic hit and occupancy suffered. Developers deferred capital expenditures, interest rates went up; it’s not a financial model that is working for them.

So we’ve more than doubled our footprint of assisted living and kept our model simple. We go in, we renovate them to be fresh and appealing to our customers, we increase the culinary experience and customer satisfaction experience. We’re seeing great success with that. A lot of our patients are discharged from our skilled nursing facilities and sometimes they don’t want to return home. We’re pleased to be able to offer them an alternative that is best in class.

Some of the Medicaid cuts that are part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), we’re trying to see how those play out at the state level. There’s pressure on rural hospitals, there’s pressure on skilled nursing facilities, there’s pressure on the Medicaid program. There’s always pressure on the Medicaid program, so I’m not sure that’s something new, but it’s definitely a top focus for us this year.

Tim Fields, CEO and Co-Founder, Ignite Medical Resorts:

Last year was a milestone year for Ignite Medical Resorts. We continued our strategy of smart, disciplined growth with acquisitions in Oklahoma and Texas and opened two brand-new, state- of-the-art facilities in greater St. Louis and greater Chicago. We are proud to bring our LuxeRehab model into new markets and to partner with exceptional new team members committed to elevating care for their communities.

This year, Ignite was honored with numerous recognitions that reflect the strength of our culture and the dedication of our teams, including but not limited to the U.S. News & World Report’s Best in Short-Term Rehabilitation and Newsweek’s Best Nursing Homes.

This year marked a turning point in how we leverage technology to support clinical excellence, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability. We launched an internal Technology Steering Committee to evaluate, pilot and deploy emerging tools, and we began building an in- house AI department to develop proprietary applications not yet available in the marketplace. I was grateful for the opportunity to speak about innovation at LTC100 and to serve on eCAP’s Catalyst Council, helping assess technology poised to transform our sector.

In 2025, we advanced technology and AI applications across key areas, including:

• Admissions and referral management

• Managed care authorization workflows

• Reimbursement capture

• Clinical change-of-condition detection and predictive analytics

• Remote patient monitoring

• Enterprise-wide business intelligence and data visualization

• Quality measure improvement

• Month-end close, cash forecasting

• Robotic floor cleaning technology

We are fully leaning into the role of technology as a force multiplier for our teams and an essential component of the future skilled nursing model. We enter 2026 with strong momentum and an active pipeline of acquisitions—including opportunities in new states—that align with our model and mission. However, our industry still faces three systemic challenges: regulation, reimbursement and staffing.

The current regulatory environment, what many providers experience as “the stick and the stick,” has created unnecessary burden without improving quality outcomes. Skilled nursing remains more heavily regulated than nuclear power, yet the system is not delivering better care or protecting seniors more effectively. During the federal government shutdown, when survey activity paused, operations continued uninterrupted, and many would argue care improved because teams were able to focus fully on residents rather than compliance theatrics. We need sweeping reform that differentiates between bad actors and the majority of providers delivering strong care.

Managed care, meanwhile, continues to expect more while paying less. Federal alignment between Medicare Advantage and Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement is long overdue. Without structural correction, we risk perpetuating a system of “Medicare disadvantage.”

Additionally, the lack of a national pay-for-performance model remains a glaring gap. Today, two operators with dramatically different quality outcomes can be reimbursed identically. A rational incentive structure would elevate quality across the board—because even poor performers will chase better results if reimbursement is tied to them. On Medicare, CMS gave our industry a rate increase but re-aligned wage indexes and value-based purchasing (VBP) to wipe them out.

Reimbursement isn’t keeping up with rising inflation and case mix index (CMI) – it needs to be addressed. State Medicaid disparities also remain indefensible. The fact that reimbursement for the same resident’s care in Kansas is double that of Texas, for example, is alarming.

The next five years present an urgent workforce challenge as the “silver tsunami” accelerates. We will not meet rising demand without a national strategy that includes:

• Expanded federal pathways for foreign-born health care workers

• State and community-based pipelines to grow certified nursing assistants (CNAs), nurses and therapists

• Investment in upskilling the existing workforce

Ignite will continue to lead by example with Ignite University, our growing internal training and leadership development ecosystem. In 2026, we will train dozens of emerging leaders through our Leadership Lion program to become administrators, directors of nursing and directors of rehabilitation. Our new partnership with Clasp is designed to create clear advancement pathways: from CNA to licensed practical nurse (LPN) or licensed vocational nurse (LVN); from LPN/LVN to registered nurse (RN); and from physical therapist assistant (PTA) to physical therapist (PT). These initiatives will be essential in shaping the workforce of tomorrow.

We work in an extraordinarily challenging business, and the model Ignite operates is even more complex. But our commitment to technology, standards, culture and most importantly our frontline caregivers remains unwavering. Without our hardworking superheroes, our model simply does not work.

There is tremendous optimism heading into 2026, and I look forward to a year of continued growth, meaningful impact and shared success.

Nate Schema, CEO, The Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society

I’m energized by the opportunities in front of us. This will be a year of building on what’s working; bringing new technology to our teams, strengthening access to care in rural communities and continuing to elevate the experience for both residents and caregivers. With two-thirds of our residents living in rural areas, we have a special responsibility to lead with solutions that are scalable and grounded in the needs of our communities.

One of the most exciting areas of momentum is virtual care. My Care Line has already shown just how powerful timely clinical support can be for teams in remote locations. Today, the service connects 27 Good Samaritan skilled nursing and assisted living locations across 14 South Dakota communities with registered nurses and advanced practice providers after hours – including 24-hour coverage on weekends and overnight support during the week.

This ensures caregivers can quickly address changes in condition, medication questions or resident assessments. We’ve already seen more than 500 calls, and early indicators point to greater stability and fewer hospital transfers. In 2026, we will expand My Care Line, starting with rural communities where around-the-clock support will have the greatest impact.

We’re also investing in technology that meaningfully lightens the load for our caregivers. One example is a new AI-enabled admissions tool our clinical leaders developed with our enterprise data analytics team. Instead of reviewing hospital packets that can be 150 pages, our local care teams will soon receive a clear, four-page summary that highlights the most essential clinical information. While it won’t replace clinical judgment, it will offer a faster, more focused starting point – helping nurses prioritize the information that matters most.

We plan to pilot this tool in our highest-volume locations early in 2026 with plans to scale the resource across the organization by mid-year.

Supporting our workforce remains essential. The National Center for Healthcare Workforce projects a 24% RN shortage in rural areas compared to 7% in urban areas by 2027. The workforce investments we make today will ensure our parents, neighbors and loved ones can access the care they need tomorrow. One example is our redesigned licensed nurse orientation that helps new nurses build confidence from day one. Since its launch this past summer, more than 200 nurses have completed the program, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The combination of virtual learning, on-site training and one-on-one coaching creates a consistent, high-quality experience across our communities — including our most rural locations. In 2026, we will continue expanding this work, offering clear pathways for growth and reinforcing Good Samaritan as an exceptional place to build a long-term care career.

We also see an opportunity to help shape common-sense, streamlined regulations that encourage innovation and support quality care. As states set their agendas, we’ll stay focused on what we can influence: using technology to expand access, investing in our people and operating with discipline and purpose.

I’m optimistic about where we’re headed. With transformative technology, a strong and supported workforce and a deep commitment to seniors in rural America, 2026 will be a year that advances the future of long-term care.

Clif Porter II, CEO, American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL)

In 2026, long-term care is sitting at the fulcrum of change: on one side are the pressures of the here and now. On the other, the blue-sky potential of what lies ahead. Our constant challenge is to deliver for our residents in our current environment while also shaping the future. AHCA is focused on helping providers strengthen our workforce, address concerns around Medicare Advantage and rationalize the regulatory environment. As we pursue a better way forward, long-term care will come out stronger, wiser and even more prepared to answer the nation’s call for care.

Starting out as an administrator-in-training, I know firsthand that the strongest aspect of long-term care is our workforce. And yet, as the nation ages, we still find ourselves in critical need of federal and state support to build a pipeline of qualified caregivers. In the new year, we will continue to advocate for expanded training programs, better recruitment channels and retention incentives that will make it possible for us to find, educate and develop the passionate people who make this work possible.

The vulnerable populations we serve deserve safety, accountability and transparency. But today’s regulatory environment hasn’t delivered, and no one is satisfied with the results. It is quick to penalize, slow to recognize modern care practices and inconsistent in its approach. While remaining accountable, we must continue to foster an oversight system that promotes quality, prioritizes patients over paperwork and supports innovation. To date, the profession has offered 45 proposals to federal officials on how to create a more rational regulatory environment.

We will continue to push for improvements, like the successful expansion of the Civil Monetary Penalties Reinvestment Program, allowing providers to dedicate more time and resources to enhancing care.

In 2026, we will continue to encourage policymakers to reaffirm the promise of Medicare Advantage (MA), ensuring that plans provide seniors access to care when they need it. Research shows that post-acute care is disproportionately affected by MA prior authorization practices. Denials are frequent and often reversed, indicating they should never have been issued in the first place. With more than half of eligible seniors enrolled in MA plans, we must insist that clinical decisions remain with medical professionals and patients — not AI and insurers.

We begin 2026 as a stronger profession because of our unity in 2025. I’m incredibly grateful to our members for their trust and guidance in my first year as the new president and CEO at AHCA/NCAL. Together, we overturned a staffing mandate that threatened our ability to serve our residents. We also shielded skilled nursing facilities from reductions to provider taxes. These wins bolster my outlook, my optimism and my pride, but the better way forward is not just playing defense. In 2026, we’re going to be on the offense. When we deliver solutions that matter, we make progress. When we focus on our residents and stay united, we win.

Katie Smith Sloan, CEO, LeadingAge

Workforce is the defining issue for aging services, and it remains LeadingAge’s highest priority for 2026. We are doubling down on efforts to strengthen the pipeline of professionals entering the field and to invest in those already serving older adults. This means advancing comprehensive strategies that combine training, education, and career development with advocacy on key policy issues to ensure providers can recruit and retain qualified staff. We’re committed to supporting and expanding the aging services workforce, because without staff, there is no care.

In addition to workforce, nursing homes face a complex set of challenges in 2026. Providers will contend with heightened scrutiny from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). Audits targeting fraud and abuse are likely to intensify; therefore, providers will be particularly meticulous in their documentation and compliance practices.

Also on the regulatory front, infection prevention and emergency preparedness remain critical responsibilities, even as federal agencies’ capacity to guide providers through communicable disease threats and other crises is diminished.

Finally, ownership transparency continues to be a federal priority, with enhanced reporting requirements aimed at curbing misuse of funds and poor performance across entities. Combined, these pressures underscore the need for strong leadership, robust training and systemic support to ensure quality care and operational stability.

Our LeadingAge LTSS Center at UMass Boston is working with Moving Forward and 24 Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Programs (GWEPs) nationwide to establish CNA apprenticeship programs in nursing homes, creating sustainable career ladders. This collaboration leverages local partnerships to strengthen the pipeline of certified nursing assistants while ensuring training aligns with community needs. By connecting GWEPs with nursing homes, we’re building a model that can be replicated nationwide to address workforce shortages.

We’re also updating our Nurse Leadership Enrichment and Development (Nurse LEAD) program to help nurse supervisors strengthen team dynamics and reduce turnover. The revised modules will launch in early 2026 and will include new content informed by focus groups with nurse leaders to address real-world challenges. By reframing supervisory skills as an integral part of everyday nursing practice, we aim to empower nurses to lead effectively and foster a culture of support and collaboration.

Through a partnership with Rush University and the Illinois Department on Aging, we’re developing standardized training and career advancement badges for direct care professionals, focusing on dementia care, mental health and peer mentoring. These badges will provide recognition for specialized skills, open doors to expanded responsibilities and may lead to wage increases or academic credit. This initiative is designed to create clear, rewarding career ladders that help retain talent and improve care quality.

We continue to push for common-sense immigration and workforce policies to ensure providers can recruit and retain qualified staff. Our advocacy focuses on expanding visa programs and reducing barriers for foreign-born workers who play a critical role in long-term care. At the same time, we’re working to secure federal and state investments in training and education programs that support both new employees and existing staff.

Together, these efforts position providers to reduce turnover, strengthen quality care and build resilient teams prepared to meet the evolving needs of older adults. LeadingAge’s mission is clear: support our members in navigating these challenges while advancing solutions that strengthen their workforce and improve the lives of older adults.

Tracey Moorhead, CEO, American Association of Post-Acute Care Nursing (AAPACN)

This year will be pivotal and exciting for AAPACN – the association’s board of directors recently approved an ambitious new strategic plan to guide our next phase of growth and expanded services to post-acute care providers. AAPACN’s recognized strength in regulatory and compliance arenas will continue to be a core focus, but we’ve heard that our members want more assistance and support.

Specifically, members have asked for more targeted, individualized support for facilities and for additional educational products and certifications for members of the broader interdisciplinary team. These new products will enhance AAPACN’s legacy focus on the Resident Assessment Coordinator (RAC-CT) and the Director of Nursing Services (DNS-CT). The AAPACN Board believes that new services and resources can equip facilities to achieve operational efficiency and care quality.

AAPACN members continue to cite workforce and culture challenges as the most pressing challenges. We know a healthy workforce culture improves the quality of care residents receive, strengthens trust among families and residents and supports overall staff well-being and retention. Our board believes we have a unique opportunity to unite owners, administrators and clinical leaders to drive transformational culture change within facilities through AAPACN tools and resources.

More broadly, the AAPACN board recognizes a growing need to elevate the visibility, perceived value and appeal of post-acute care as both a vital health-care delivery sector and as a rewarding career path. The current regulatory climate, including a recent proposal to declassify nursing as a profession, requires a greater focus on long-term, post-acute care opportunities available to nursing students and current nurses.

AAPACN will launch initiatives in 2026 to redefine, elevate and unite long-term, post-acute care providers and to foster a robust, resilient and confident community of professionals. These initiatives will include research and data analytics to demonstrate which facilities are high performers, the factors that have contributed to their success and to highlight opportunities for further improvement. For individuals, AAPACN will launch innovative new ways to access high- quality tools and resources throughout the workday. AAPACN’s board and staff are committed to achieving and highlighting excellence in post-acute care through innovation and transformation in post-acute care, enabling providers to deliver unparalleled care.

Despite their relentless efforts and thanks to immense public pressure, we successfully stripped the industry-backed pesticides preemption rider, Section 453, from the final Interior and Environment funding bill,” Pingree said.
By removing this rider, we pushed back against Big Chemical, preserved local control, and made clear that public health comes before corporate profits.
Section 453, which was included in the draft Interior and Environment appropriations bill, would have sharply limited that authority.
Seven states—Maine, Alaska, Hawaii, Maryland, Utah, Nevada, and Vermont—do not preempt local governments from regulating pesticide use within their jurisdictions.","Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, announced today that she has successfully stripped a provision in the FY2026 funding bill that would have shielded pesticide manufacturers like Bayer from lawsuits. Pingree has been leading the effort to remove Section 453 from her subcommittee’s funding bill since Republicans quietly included it in their draft bill earlier this summer.

“For too long, powerful chemical companies like Bayer have spent billions lobbying Congress to override the voices of states, towns, and families who are simply trying to protect their health. Despite their relentless efforts and thanks to immense public pressure, we successfully stripped the industry-backed pesticides preemption rider, Section 453, from the final Interior and Environment funding bill,” Pingree said.

“This provision would have handed pesticide manufacturers exactly what they’ve been lobbying for: federal preemption that stops state and local governments from restricting the use of harmful, cancer-causing chemicals, adding health warnings, or holding companies accountable in court when people are harmed. It would have meant that only the federal government gets a say—even though we know federal reviews can take years, and are often subject to intense industry pressure,” Pingree continued. “In Maine and across the country, communities have acted responsibly to limit pesticide use near schools, homes, farms, and waterways. They shouldn’t be told by Washington—or by chemical lobbyists—that they no longer have the right to protect their children, their land, or their livelihoods. By removing this rider, we pushed back against Big Chemical, preserved local control, and made clear that public health comes before corporate profits. But this is not the end of the fight. We’ll be watching closely to ensure that similar language is not included in a Farm Bill or another legislative vehicle.”

Pesticides in the United States are regulated under a combination of federal, state, and local laws. The primary federal statute governing pesticide registration and use is the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate the sale, labeling, and use of pesticides nationwide. Under FIFRA, the term “pesticide” includes substances used to control insects, rodents, weeds, fungi, and other organisms designated as pests.

EPA is required to review each registered pesticide at least once every 15 years to determine whether it can continue to be used without causing unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. While FIFRA establishes a federal baseline for pesticide regulation, it has long been interpreted to allow states and local governments to adopt additional protections to address health and environmental risks in their own communities.

Section 453, which was included in the draft Interior and Environment appropriations bill, would have sharply limited that authority. The provision would have prohibited EPA from issuing guidance, taking regulatory action, or approving pesticide labeling that differed in any way from the conclusions of a FIFRA human health assessment or a pesticide carcinogenicity classification. In practice, this language would have restricted EPA’s ability to respond to emerging science and would have strengthened industry arguments that states and localities cannot impose additional warnings, restrictions, or safeguards.

Debates over state and local authority to regulate pesticide use have been litigated for decades, particularly in cases involving widely used chemicals such as Roundup and paraquat, which have been linked to serious health harms including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and other cancers. Many states, cities, and counties have adopted measures to restrict pesticide spraying near schools, homes, and public spaces, citing the heightened vulnerability of children to toxic exposure and risks to brain development, reproduction, and long-term health.

Seven states—Maine, Alaska, Hawaii, Maryland, Utah, Nevada, and Vermont—do not preempt local governments from regulating pesticide use within their jurisdictions. In Maine alone, there are more than 30 state and local regulations related to pesticide use and warning requirements that could have been undermined or preempted under Section 453.

“This new Institute reflects both Sul Ross State University’s long-standing commitment to serving our region and the extraordinary leadership of The Meadows Foundation,” Dr. Carlos Hernandez, president of Sul Ross State University, said in the release.
“Their leadership has helped advance water research and stewardship across Texas — including the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment in San Marcos — and now extends to Far West Texas through this new Institute.
For Billy Tarrant, interim director of the Meadows Research Institute for West Texas Water, the Institute’s mission is rooted in collaboration and place.
“The Meadows Research Institute was created for the region — and with the region,” Tarrant said.","ALPINE In one of the most arid regions of Texas, where water sustains communities, working lands, wildlife, and local economies, Sul Ross State University has launched the Meadows Research Institute for West Texas Water, supported by a $2.75 million commitment from The Meadows Foundation that includes both long-term endowment funding and multi-year operational support.

Housed at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, the Meadows Research Institute for West Texas Water advances collaborative water solutions in Far West Texas through applied research, education, and technical expertise to ensure a resilient water future for people, land, and wildlife, a news release said.

The philanthropic commitment from The Meadows Foundation includes $500,000 annually for five years to establish the Institute’s endowment, providing durable, long-term support for faculty leadership, research, and academic programming. In addition, the commitment includes $250,000 in matching funds over five years — $50,000 annually — to support early operational needs and help catalyze additional investment during the Institute’s formative years.

Water in Far West Texas is increasingly scarce. Limited aquifer recharge, stressed spring systems, aging infrastructure, and growing demands place mounting pressure on the region’s water resources. The Meadows Research Institute was created to strengthen understanding of desert water systems and expand the tools, workforce, and partnerships needed to steward this vital resource wisely, the release said.

“This new Institute reflects both Sul Ross State University’s long-standing commitment to serving our region and the extraordinary leadership of The Meadows Foundation,” Dr. Carlos Hernandez, president of Sul Ross State University, said in the release. “This $2.75 million commitment — one of the largest philanthropic investments in the university’s history — provides the foundation to build a world-class research institute that connects science, education, and community needs, ensuring that water solutions are grounded in the people and landscapes of Far West Texas.”

“Water has always shaped the people, places, and opportunities of Far West Texas,” Eric R. Meadows, president and CEO of The Meadows Foundation, said in the release. “Our commitment to the Institute and Sul Ross State University reflects our belief that careful, science-based stewardship is essential to sustaining both this vital resource and the communities who depend on it. This gift is an investment in the region to strengthen the knowledge and leadership needed for generations to come.”

The Meadows Research Institute builds on decades of Sul Ross leadership in water science, land stewardship, and community engagement. It also emerged from strong regional demand, highlighted during the 2024 Water in the Desert conference, where landowners, scientists, community leaders, and policy makers called for more coordinated research, training, and support across the Trans-Pecos. Building on that momentum, Institute faculty and staff will be fully engaged in the upcoming Water in the Desert conference, scheduled for Feb. 11-13, contributing research, expertise, and leadership as the Institute’s work continues to take shape.

The Institute’s work will center on three core areas: applied research, education and workforce development, and technical assistance and community support. Initial efforts will focus on groundwater recharge and flow paths, groundwater-surface water interactions, desert spring systems such as San Solomon Springs and Independence Creek, watershed dynamics, and the impacts of land management and climate variability.

According to Dr. Louis Harveson, associate provost for research and development at Sul Ross State University, who helped guide this effort from conception to launch, the new institute reflects the importance of philanthropic leadership in advancing water solutions.

“The Meadows Foundation has consistently provided the spark for meaningful, science-based efforts like this — investments that strengthen both people and landscapes,” Harveson said. “Their leadership has helped advance water research and stewardship across Texas — including the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment in San Marcos — and now extends to Far West Texas through this new Institute. That kind of vision allows universities to address regional water challenges while contributing knowledge that resonates far beyond a single place.”

Over time, the Meadows Research Institute for West Texas Water will build a suite of education and workforce development programs to help address projected water workforce shortages in Texas, while also expanding practical tools and services for landowners, groundwater districts, municipalities, and rural utilities.

For Billy Tarrant, interim director of the Meadows Research Institute for West Texas Water, the Institute’s mission is rooted in collaboration and place.

“The Meadows Research Institute was created for the region — and with the region,” Tarrant said. “The combination of long-term endowment support and early operational investment gives us the foundation we need to grow thoughtfully, work alongside communities, and deliver real-world solutions that support a resilient water future for West Texas and other arid landscapes facing similar challenges.”

The organization works across North America, not just in the Midwest, and covers a broader range of clean energy than just renewable energy.
CleanCounts works in the rare field of tracking Energy Attribute Certificates, the most popular being Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).
At the time Gerber arrived, most of the organization’s work involved tracking state government clean energy transactions to comply with their renewable energy goals.
Since he started, the clean energy registry has made several changes, starting with using local talent to develop more sophisticated software in 2017.","When Benjamin Gerber became chief executive officer of a clean energy data nonprofit in 2015, the organization had just three employees and a small but growing customer base.

The nonprofit Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System Inc., or M-RETS, has expanded from a $1 million budget to $10 million annually. It has a new name, a larger service area, more than 25 employees, a robust information technology structure, and a much bigger office in downtown Minneapolis.

M-RETS changed its name to “CleanCounts” last year to better reflect what it does. The organization works across North America, not just in the Midwest, and covers a broader range of clean energy than just renewable energy. “It’s a better representation of what we do and what we can do,” Gerber said.

CleanCounts works in the rare field of tracking Energy Attribute Certificates, the most popular being Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). The certificates solve an intrinsic problem with clean energy.

When wind turbines and solar installations produce energy, it flows into the electricity grid, and there’s no easy way to distinguish their electrons from those produced by fossil-fuel plants. Registries like CleanCounts track RECs and allow their subscribers to buy and sell them, with multiple layers of data and serial numbers to prevent double counting. At a rudimentary level, it functions like a baby registry.

The United States has several REC registries, most of which cover just one state or a region. Only two, CleanCounts and the North American Renewables Registry (NAR), accept clients from anywhere in the U.S. or Canada. CleanCounts issued its 2 billionth certificate last year, affirming it is the continent’s biggest registry.

Mark Silberg, energy policy adviser to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, recently joined the CleanCounts board of directors because of its reputation. “CleanCounts’ role in enabling transparent, high-integrity clean energy markets is more important than ever,” said Silberg.

M-RETS began in 2007, after Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Canadian province of Manitoba agreed to create a nonprofit to track clean energy production at a time when they all had passed legislation requiring more of it. They ensured that the registry would have no ties to utilities or regional transmission organizations such as Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., or MISO.

Eight years later, Gerber was working at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce when he spoke to Minnesota Public Radio for a story about a rate case at the Public Utilities Commission. The Detroit-area native’s background as an environmental lawyer enabled him to address complex regulatory issues.

The 45-minute interview turned into a 45-second sound clip that attracted a recruiter assigned to find a new chief executive officer for the nonprofit. He got the job.

At the time Gerber arrived, most of the organization’s work involved tracking state government clean energy transactions to comply with their renewable energy goals. What was emerging, however, was a “voluntary” market for companies looking to buy clean energy “for business reasons or for cost or for a host of other reasons,” Gerber said.

Initially, President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan sparked interest in tracking clean electricity. The registry began attracting some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, including Google, Microsoft and hundreds of others. They represent CleanCount’s largest revenue source.

When President Donald Trump took office in 2016 and expressed disdain for clean energy, M-RETS saw business increase. “We saw more growth under the first Trump administration than we’d ever seen,” Gerber said. “It was really because corporations saw that if the federal government wasn’t going to continue doing this, they were going to take that up, pick up that slack.”

Corporations embraced the declining cost of clean power. Because many were global, they still had to support clean energy production to continue operating in Europe, which has high environmental standards and laws, Gerber said.

Since he started, the clean energy registry has made several changes, starting with using local talent to develop more sophisticated software in 2017. “We have more than 40 [part-time] software developers working on the product,” Gerber said. “We’ve built what I’m confident is the best registry in the world, right here in Minnesota.”

In 2019, it broadened generation-tracking capacity from wind and solar to include Renewable Thermal Certificates covering the production of renewable natural gas, biogas, clean hydrogen, and combined heat and power. The organization also added an Energy Attribute Certificate for nuclear energy in 2023, an increasingly important recognition as Google, Microsoft and other technology companies sign power purchase agreements with nuclear operators.

Responding to market demand, CleanCounts can fine-tune clean energy tracking to the hour it was produced, a datapoint Google had wanted and now employs for data centers worldwide. Google uses CleanCounts to measure that data, he said.

Gerber sees tracking food waste and turning it into energy through biodigesters as a new market. A carbon capture and sequestration certificate for coal plants and other carbon-emitting technologies could be a possibility. Tracking ammonia production using clean hydrogen will arrive this or next year.

Josh Levy works for Pivot Energy, a community solar developer based in Denver. As Pivot’s offsite solutions and strategic accounts senior director, he has worked with CleanCounts for years and applauds its innovative approach. He cites the recent addition of an attribute to RECs that recognizes pollinator-friendly solar projects.

“They’ve done a really good job — besides just their relations with developers and folks like us — of keeping their finger on the pulse of what is being asked of them from both the purchaser or procurement side as well as on the development side,” he said.

Gerber believes Minnesota could play a key role in moving cleaner fuels to an international audience. Biomethane and clean ammonia from Minnesota could be shipped abroad, with the environmental attributes tracked by CleanCounts. And there’s more on the way, as the organization plans to announce early next year that it will begin tracking three emerging clean energy sectors.

Internally, Gerber has focused on building “a great culture” for employees, said chief growth officer Rob Davis. Employees have taken field trips to a Wisconsin food waste-to-electricity facility and the University of Minnesota’s wind turbine in Rosemount. “The work is very serious and very, very capital W wonky, but the culture of the organization is just really fun,” Davis said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Sustainable-Ben-Gerber-and-Rob-Davis.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 17:58:36.328701

Now, to learn more about what's at stake, let's bring on Henry Sokolski.
HENRY SOKOLSKI: Well, the plant has been plundered of a lot of important components.
That's the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog.
MARTÍNEZ: Henry Sokolski is the founder and executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center.","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

Next we turn to Ukraine. Ukrainian security officials are planning to meet this week with European leaders and U.S. representatives in Paris seeking to end Russia's war. As they hammer out positions on security guarantees and economic support, they may also come closer to deciding who will control Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, located in Southern Ukraine. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, it powered one-fifth of Ukraine's electrical grid. It fell under Russian control in early 2022. Now, to learn more about what's at stake, let's bring on Henry Sokolski. He's the executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center. That's a nonprofit nonpartisan think tank. He also served as the deputy for nonproliferation policy in the office of the secretary of defense in the George H.W. Bush administration. So what do we know right now about who's running the plant and actually the stability of its six reactors?

HENRY SOKOLSKI: Well, the plant has been plundered of a lot of important components. It's now being used as a military base by the Russians. There's heavy mining around the facility. For that reason, reliable supplies of water and electricity that are critical to the safe operation of the plant are no longer available. So the Russians claim they own it. They are trying to run it with a quarter of the staff that was originally there. It's pretty sketchy.

MARTÍNEZ: Is it still operating, though? Is it producing energy?

SOKOLSKI: All of the plants are on cold shutdown. However, they do need to have water circulating to keep the fuel from heating up and boiling over and producing a loss of coolant accident.

MARTÍNEZ: OK. Now, a recent version of the peace proposal suggested that the U.S., Russia and Ukraine would jointly operate the power plant with oversight from the International Atomic Energy Agency. That's the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Is that a fair proposal?

SOKOLSKI: That is aspirational. The Ukrainians don't want to deal with the Russians, and the Russians don't want to deal with the Ukrainians. The Americans don't want to deal with the sovereignty of the plant and who owns it, licenses and runs it. And so they've proposed, well, we'll just all get into the hot tub together and figure this out as we go. That probably won't work.

MARTÍNEZ: So, Henry, that goes, I think, it sounds like more than aspirational. It sounds more like pie in the sky.

SOKOLSKI: I think the idea that you have the IEA doing anything other than blessing what's going on is pretty delusional. They do not license anything. They do not operate anything. They have no record of doing it. And that's the key player that the Americans are proposing to leaven the bread of this proposal. I don't think that'll work.

MARTÍNEZ: Why does Zaporizhzhia matter strategically to each side?

SOKOLSKI: Well, first of all, the Russians want to take possession and have sovereignty over the area around it, and the Ukrainians want to demilitarize the area around it, the Russians don't. So it's literally control of the region as much as it is control of electricity in the future. It's not clear whether they can get the plant back up. You know, the Russians say they can do it in a year easily. Ukrainians say it'd take at least two years, if not more. So it's not been running for a good number of years. I don't think this is something you can turn a switch on.

MARTÍNEZ: Henry, when you look at the state of the plant and where it is, it's location in a war zone, how great is the risk of a nuclear accident?

SOKOLSKI: It's been the one leverage diplomatic military point that Putin has exercised over not only Ukraine, but Europe and NATO. They fear another Chernobyl. Now, that may be a little breathless because Chernobyl is a different design, but bottom line, it's a present threat.

MARTÍNEZ: And one more thing quickly, Henry, just a few seconds here, why should the world care about what happens to Zaporizhzhia?

SOKOLSKI: Well, you know, the world seems to be hell bent on using nuclear power to save the planet. So if this thing goes down poorly, that puts a dent in that market.

MARTÍNEZ: Henry Sokolski is the founder and executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center. Henry, thank you.

SOKOLSKI: Thank you.

There’s one bright spot in this, however: Lucid Motors, which announced that their production and delivery in 2025 were both up compared to 2024.
Some part of it may be powered by clever promotions — like addressing some Tesla owners’ frustrations with Elon Musk by offering a discount on Lucid vehicles if a buyer is trading in a Tesla.
But there’s also the matter of Lucid addressing the elephant in the room of the expiring tax credit.
Raphael’s post pointed to the role that the federal tax credit had played in getting people to buy and lease EVs in the first place.","For many automakers selling electric vehicles in the U.S. this year, the fourth quarter was not a reason for celebration. Tesla’s vehicle deliveries were down 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. Rivian’s overall sales for the year were also down compared to 2024. For the U.S. market, it isn’t hard to find a culprit for this: the Trump administration’s decision to end the federal tax credits for EVs.

But it’s led to an overall drop in sales — as InsideEVs pointed out this week, EV sales in the U.S. are scheduled to drop year over year in 2025 for the first time in six years.

There’s one bright spot in this, however: Lucid Motors, which announced that their production and delivery in 2025 were both up compared to 2024. In doing so, they also achieved their production goal for the year, which seemed like a long shot fairly recently.

What helped fuel Lucid’s victory lap while their competitors have struggled in a shifting environment? Some part of it may be powered by clever promotions — like addressing some Tesla owners’ frustrations with Elon Musk by offering a discount on Lucid vehicles if a buyer is trading in a Tesla.

But there’s also the matter of Lucid addressing the elephant in the room of the expiring tax credit. In a post on August 14, 2025, Lucid’s Vice President of Revenue Erwin Raphael announced that the company would implement its own version of the federal tax credit for drivers interested in the Lucid Gravity through the end of 2025.

Raphael’s post pointed to the role that the federal tax credit had played in getting people to buy and lease EVs in the first place. “[W]e are committed to doing our part through the end of the year to ensure an equivalent benefit remains available for our Lucid Gravity lease customers who are unable to take delivery before September 30,” he wrote. What Lucid’s 2026 will look like is anyone’s guess — though Electrek reports that the company will begin production on a midsize vehicle later this year. Will that be enough to continue the company’s hot streak?","https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lucid-gravity.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2026-01-05 17:58:31.176922

The Government Accountability Office said the National Telecommunications and Information Administration violated the Congressional Review Act when it unveiled various changes to the $42 billion BEAD program last year. Those changes, talked up at the time by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as “critical reforms,” included removing the preference for fiber projects in favor of being technologically neutral, as well as relaxing various rules around workforce, climate and the environment.

But in response to an inquiry by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, GAO found that the policy changes should have been submitted to Congress and the comptroller general for review before being rolled out to the states. GAO determined that the changes constituted a rule, subject to the CRA, as they came from a federal agency in its official capacity, those changes will have a future impact, and it “implements, interprets, and prescribes law or policy.”

“By changing the manner in which the BEAD Program is administered, these actions substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties participating in the BEAD Program,” the GAO’s report says.

The NTIA’s changes to the BEAD program had thrown states for a loop, as after the three-month program review at the federal level they were forced to revamp their plans for how they would spend their allocation of federal dollars. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Congress said the program’s various rules and requirements had stopped money getting out the door quickly to get more people connected, having originally been appropriated by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

Once Lutnick unveiled the changes to the program and got states to change their plans, new NTIA Administrator Arielle Roth said she was “pleasantly surprised” at the progress they had made. NTIA approved a first round of proposals in November, and it had targeted getting every state and territory approved by the end of last year but fell short of that goal.

But GAO ruled that the changes NTIA had made were too great to be pushed through without congressional approval.

“Among other things, the Policy Notice eliminates certain requirements previously imposed on Eligible Entities and subgrantees through the BEAD NOFO; alters the criteria by which NTIA will evaluate applications; requires Eligible Entities to conduct an additional round of subgrantee selection after rescinding all preliminary and provisional subaward selections; and modifies the agency's interpretation of statutory terms, such as “‘priority broadband project,’” theGAO report says.

After states have undertaken months of work to amend their plans to comply with the administration’s new rules, the GAO findings create new concerns about whether BEAD money will ever flow down to the states, even as several have talked up the possibilities of what they can do with that cash.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, whose state was among the first to be approved by NTIA, called BEAD a “generational investment,” while Veneeth Iyengar, executive director of state broadband office ConnectLA, said in November it meant the state could “shift from planning to putting shovels in the ground in the next several weeks.”

“By failing to follow the proper process to ensure Congressional oversight, NTIA has again created additional uncertainty and delay for states,” Revati Prasad, executive director of the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said in a statement. “The Benton Institute urges Members of Congress to review the June 6 changes as soon as they are submitted and to continue providing meaningful oversight of this critical broadband deployment program, which aims to finally close our access divide.”

Experts said the impact of this GAO decision is unclear. The CRA gives Congress 60 days to review and reject rules issued by federal agencies, and if Congress were to enact a resolution of disapproval, those rules would be struck down. Whether that would happen and Congress responds remains to be seen.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/05/20260105_GAO_georgeclerk-2/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 17:13:01.885967

BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant expanded with Amazon Alexa+.

One year after the world premiere of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive with BMW Operating System X at CES 2025, visitors to this year’s CES can experience the revolutionary user-interaction concept firsthand in the BMW iX3. With a balanced combination of digital functions and physical elements, it elevates intuitive operation according to BMW’s guiding principle ‘Hands on the Wheel, Eyes on the Road’ to a new level of driver orientation. Built on the technological foundation of a software-defined vehicle, the customer experience in the BMW iX3 continues to evolve. For the first time, BMW presents the next generation AI-powered BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. BMW is the first manufacturer to expand its voice assistant with the AI assistant Amazon Alexa+. This enables intuitive and intelligent interaction between passengers and the vehicle in a natural dialogue. The interaction includes the operation of vehicle functions as well as access to information and knowledge beyond

the vehicle. For the first time, passengers can ask multiple questions in a single sentence—covering both your vehicle’s features and e.g. general knowledge topics.

The integration of Amazon Alexa+ into the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant represents a technological leap forward that focuses on added value for the customer. The AI technology used in the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is a Large Language Model (LLM), a generative AI that understands language and is capable of formulating its own responses. Starting in the second half of 2026 at the latest, this further development will be gradually rolled out in Germany and the USA across all BMW models equipped with BMW Operating System 9 and X. More detail can be found here.

BMW iX3 transforms waiting time into entertainment: stream a movie, play a video game or make a video call.[1]

The BMW booth at CES also focuses on the wide range of entertainment options in BMW Operating System X. It offers an extensive selection of apps, videos, and games.

Sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology: higher efficiency, more range, faster charging.

The sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors, which together generate output of 345 kW/469 hp and 645 Nm (475 lb-ft) of torque. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph). Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) with particularly high levels of efficiency at the rear axle and, at the front axle, a new asynchronous motor (ASM) distinguished by its compact design and high cost efficiency. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of the BMW Group’s commitment to technological neutrality within electric mobility as well. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40 per cent compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10 per cent and manufacturing costs by 20 per cent.

The new high-voltage battery concept with cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20 per cent higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and the new concept also paves the way for a 30 per cent increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimise weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has a usable energy content of 108.7 kWh, enabling a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 miles) in the WLTP cycle.

BMW Charging: short charging times, premiere for bidirectional charging.

The advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology have a significant influence on the charging experience, too. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to fill their new BMW iX3 with enough energy at an 800V direct current (DC) rapid charging station to add up to 372 kilometres (231 miles) [2] of range in just ten minutes. The high-voltage battery can charge from 10 to 80 per cent capacity in 21 minutes. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by the BMW Group, the new BMW iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. The new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can top up on alternating current (AC) at 11 kW as standard or 22 kW [3] as an option.

Extensive bidirectional charging functions [3] are also available for the new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy supply source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) hands it the role of storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And customers can also hook their car up to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) application and earn some money in the process.

The selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the new Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the high-voltage battery. The new BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) enables bidirectional charging at home or work. And BMW Charging offers the option of cost-optimised /solar-power-optimised home charging.

In order to give owners the best possible charging experience, the new BMW iX3 will be fitted as standard with an NACS (North American Charging Standard) compatible charging port. This will provide iX3 owners access to the vast Supercharger network, while a standard CCS (Combined Charging System) adapter will preserve access to other providers from coast to coast, thus ensuring that iX3 owners are never far from a provider no matter where the journey is taking them.

Heart of Joy: The Ultimate Driving Machine reaches a new level.

One of four superbrains in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation, and steering functions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability, and efficiency is fully realized.

Together with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving sensation whatever the situation. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal, and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimized by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system, and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98% of braking maneuvers are carried out using recuperation only, without application of the friction brakes. The only occasions these are called upon are under emergency braking and during extremely sporty driving.

“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with of the next technology generation.

Another high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. With 20 times greater processing power than in the previous vehicle generation, the watercooled “superbrain of automated driving” enables a significant technological advance with the Neue Klasse in this area as well.

BMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support.

The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software.The result is a whole new form of Sheer Driving Pleasure. For example, the automatic cruise control system is not deactivated with only a light press of the brake pedal; instead, it is only switched off when the driver brakes harder. In the same way, the lane control assistance remains active even after light steering inputs by the driver.

With the optional BMW Highway / Motorway Assistant [4], drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel permanently at speeds of up to 85 mph / 130 km/h, while remaining attentive and ready to intervene. The system assists with vehicle guidance within the lane and can also perform automated lane changes when needed – a simple glance confirmation by the driver is sufficient. With active BMW Maps route guidance, the system proactively suggests lane changes at highway interchanges and exits, which can be confirmed with a quick glance in the wing mirror. The Highway Assistant remains active while passing through interchanges and until the end of highway exits. This allows BMW iX3 drivers to enjoy Level 2 driver assistance without touching the steering wheel in even more situations.

The new Highway and City Assistant [4] also offers innovative functions for urban environments, such as stopping and automatically restarting at traffic lights. Additional driver assistance features for complex urban driving situations will be rolled out later via over-the-air software updates.

BMW Group in the United States.

BMW of North America, LLC was established 50 years ago to support the sales, marketing and distribution of BMW automobiles in the U.S. BMW Motorrad was brought into the fold in 1980. In 1993 BMW Group Financial Services NA, LLC was founded, and one year later BMW Manufacturing Co., LLC began assembling vehicles in South Carolina. In 2002 and 2003, BMW Group established MINI USA, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars NA, LLC relaunching two iconic brands and rounding out its product portfolio.

Today, the BMW Group has a nationwide corporate footprint in the U.S. which consists of nearly 30 locations in 12 different states. Beyond the National Sales Company and Financial Services headquarters in Woodcliff Lake, NJ, its manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and numerous other operational facilities, BMW Group in the U.S. also includes Designworks, a strategic design consultancy in Santa Monica, CA, BMW Group Technology Office USA, a technology research and development center in Silicon Valley, and BMW i Ventures, a venture capital fund, also in Silicon Valley.

BMW Group Plant Spartanburg is the largest single BMW production facility in the world, and the global center of competence for BMW Sports Activity Vehicles including the X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and XM. The plant assembles more than 1,500 vehicles each day, and up to 450,000 annually. Since 1994, Plant Spartanburg has assembled more than 7 million BMW vehicles in the U.S.

The BMW Group sales organization in the U.S. is represented through a network of 351 BMW retailers, 143 BMW motorcycle retailers, 105 MINI passenger car dealers, and 38 Rolls-Royce Motor Car dealers.

The reviews—covering 1,3-butadiene and five high-use phthalates—signal a shift toward targeted regulation grounded in exposure-specific science rather than sweeping restrictions across all uses.

For industry players in chemicals, manufacturing, and plastics, the signal is clear: EPA is focusing regulatory scrutiny where occupational or environmental exposure is highest. The agency’s evaluations found no unreasonable risks to the general population or consumers for either chemical group. Instead, identified concerns are confined to specific industrial scenarios, particularly where workers may face elevated inhalation or dermal exposure, and in some cases, where emissions impact the environment.

EPA’s revised approach draws on expanded use of facility-specific emissions data and updated exposure models, including dermal assessments using human data. For phthalates, a cumulative risk analysis was also added, recognizing how multiple substances could interact within occupational environments. Even in the absence of biomonitoring data for young children, EPA applied additional modeling layers to ensure protective thresholds.

These refined assessments move away from precautionary overestimates, instead leveraging real-world data—such as stack height, emission temperatures, and release points—to improve accuracy. The result is a more precise understanding of when and where health risks may arise, particularly for frontline workers.

What It Means for Compliance, Risk Management, and Operations

As EPA transitions from risk evaluation to risk management, regulated companies should anticipate rules that reflect specific use cases and operating conditions rather than blanket chemical bans. Personal protective equipment, engineering controls, process changes, or safer substitutes are all on the table, but will likely be tailored to distinct industrial functions.

Notably, the presence of a chemical in a product will not automatically trigger regulatory action. For consumer goods, where phthalates and butadiene are present at trace levels—often well below 0.001%—EPA did not find unreasonable risks under current use conditions. Instead, the focus is on areas where exposure thresholds, informed by peer-reviewed science, are exceeded.

For companies across the supply chain—from chemical producers to manufacturers of plastics and automotive materials—the implications are both operational and strategic. Compliance will depend less on chemical content alone and more on demonstrating detailed exposure control measures, both in workplace settings and in environmental releases.

EPA has also emphasized collaboration as part of its risk management rulemaking. Input from industry, labor, and technical experts will be critical in shaping regulations that are both protective and feasible. Importantly, the agency has noted that rules will be designed with adaptability in mind—capable of evolving if new data becomes available.

This approach underscores a broader trend in environmental regulation: smarter oversight based on exposure science, with a focus on protecting high-risk scenarios rather than applying a one-size-fits-all solution.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260105-092524-6b5-getty-images-84D1rtGQR5o-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 16:59:51.500418

One year after the catastrophic wildfires that blazed through southern California, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) and the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) invite you to a briefing on emerging solutions to tackle the wildfire crisis, and the federal policy strategies for getting these solutions into the field. Communities nationwide are experiencing longer wildfire seasons and more intense, destructive wildfires. Hotter and drier weather, decades of fire over-suppression leading to the buildup of flammable materials, and increasing development in and around fire-prone areas have transformed wildfire—once a natural and sustainable part of American landscapes—into a major threat. From California to New Jersey, wildfires are taking a toll—costing the United States up to $424 billion annually and displacing tens of thousands of people.

This briefing will highlight efforts to address this crisis, including wildfire preparedness, response, and recovery policies and innovations in the United States.

(WTNH) — Quinnipiac University has begun work on installing 10 high-efficiency fuel cells across its campuses as part of a clean energy initiative, the school said in a statement Monday.

Six of the units will be installed at the Mount Carmel Campus, with two each at the York Hill and North Haven campuses. Installation has started in front of the standardized patient parking lot on the North Haven campus.

Each fuel cell produces 460 kilowatts of electricity by using a chemical reaction with natural gas to generate power, instead of using combustion. This process limits the byproducts to water and carbon dioxide, reducing emissions and environmental impact. Traditional utility energy emits smog-forming pollutants, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides (NOx), according to the statement.

Sal Filardi, vice president for facilities and capital planning at Quinnipiac, said that once all 10 fuel cells are online, the campuses will be generating most of their own electricity.

“We’ll still be connected to the utility grid for peak demand, but this system significantly increases our energy resilience and self-reliance,” Filardi said.

Quinnipiac said it expects to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by over 10 million pounds a year while virtually eliminating nitrogen oxide emissions from the electricity generation process.

Quinnipiac has also entered into a 10-year power purchase agreement with VFS Energy Services, a Michigan-based provider working in Connecticut. VFS will cover all installation and maintenance costs as part of the agreement. Quinnipiac will buy the electricity produced by the fuel cells at a fixed rate.

Quinnipiac has also implemented Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified building standards for several new facilities, including the new School of Business and the new SITE (Science, Innovation, Technology and Exploration) building as well as The Grove residence hall.

From the United States’ sweeping updates to tax brackets and credits under President Donald Trump’s recent legislation to Canada’s recalibrated contribution limits and income-splitting rules, taxpayers on both sides of the border face a year of both opportunities and potential pitfalls.

In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced in January 2026 a set of inflation-based updates to federal income tax brackets, standard deductions, capital gains brackets, and other provisions. According to CNBC, the two lowest tax brackets saw their income ranges increase by about 4%, while higher brackets rose roughly 2.3% compared to the previous year. Notably, these changes are layered on top of the adjustments enacted by President Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” signed into law in July 2025, which permanently extended the 2017 tax cuts, boosted the standard deduction, increased the child tax credit, and introduced a host of temporary tax breaks.

For many workers, these changes will translate into slightly larger paychecks in 2026, as the IRS also updates its withholding tables. “Folks will see slightly larger paychecks, assuming their income stays the same as 2025,” explained Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, in an interview with CNBC. However, Lautz cautioned that for most, the increase will be modest—""we’re talking about a couple of dollars a paycheck, unless you’re claiming the tips and overtime deductions,"" he said. The impact will vary, as not every worker will feel the difference, especially if their earnings or withholdings change.

The rationale behind these bracket adjustments is to keep pace with inflation, ensuring that taxpayers aren’t pushed into higher tax rates solely due to rising prices. Yet, as Garrett Watson of the Tax Foundation pointed out to CNBC, “tax bracket adjustments are a lagging measure of inflation over the prior year,” which means they may not fully keep up with the real cost of living. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index rose 2.7% in November 2025 compared to the previous year—higher than most of the 2026 tax bracket adjustments—highlighting the ongoing challenge of maintaining tax fairness in an inflationary environment.

But the story doesn’t end with bracket changes. Tax professionals across the U.S. are urging caution as the IRS prepares to accept 2025 tax returns starting January 23, 2026. According to irs.gov and echoed by advisors speaking to WBRZ News in Louisiana, taxpayers should resist the urge to file early. The reason? A host of significant federal tax changes and lingering legislative uncertainties could mean mistakes, delays, or missed opportunities for those who rush the process.

Among the most consequential changes are those stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act, adjustments to standard deductions, and modified energy tax credits. The expanded child tax credit, in particular, presents a nuanced challenge: while some pandemic-era enhancements expired at the end of 2025, other provisions have been extended or rewritten. This makes determining eligibility and the correct credit amount especially tricky for families with changing incomes or new dependents.

Another area demanding careful attention is the earned income tax credit (EITC), which saw eligibility expansions that reduce barriers for low- and middle-income workers. As WBRZ News reported, tax professionals warn that “rushing to file without fully evaluating EITC qualifications could leave eligible taxpayers shortchanged.” Retirement account rules have also shifted, with the IRS updating contribution caps and phase-out thresholds for traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans—changes that can affect deductions and taxable income, especially for high earners and small-business owners.

Energy tax credits remain popular but complex, with credits for solar installations, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient home improvements varying based on income, purchase timing, and product eligibility. Incorrect claims can trigger IRS reviews, leading to delays or even audits. According to IRS data cited by WBRZ News, millions of amended returns were processed in 2025 due to rushed filings—often because taxpayers overlooked new deductions or misreported credits.

Given these complications, experts emphasize patience and thorough preparation. “We want to make sure that they’re taking the correct credits and that they’re not filing incorrectly in a rush,” a Louisiana tax advisor told WBRZ News. The consensus is clear: gathering all relevant documents, understanding the new rules, and seeking professional advice can save both money and stress in the long run.

North of the border, Canadians are also navigating a shifting tax landscape in 2026. As reported by The Globe and Mail, the federal indexation rate for tax brackets is set at 2%, effective January 1, down from 2.7% in 2025. In a significant move, the government cut the lowest tax bracket rate to 14% from 15% as of July 1, 2025, resulting in a full-year rate of 14.5% for 2025. These changes, like their U.S. counterparts, are designed to reflect inflation and keep taxes fair for ordinary Canadians.

For savers, the annual Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contribution limit remains at $7,000 for 2025, with the lifetime limit rising to $109,000 in 2026 for those eligible since 2009. Retirement savers also see a boost: the RRSP maximum contribution limit for 2026 is $33,810, up from $32,490 in 2025. The deadline for 2025 contributions is March 2, 2026, giving Canadians a bit more time to maximize their tax-advantaged savings.

Retirees will want to pay close attention to the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback threshold, which increases to $95,323 in 2026. Those with 2025 incomes above $93,454 will face a 15% recovery tax on the difference, up to the total amount of OAS received. Meanwhile, couples using prescribed rate loans for income splitting must ensure that interest on outstanding 2025 loans is paid by January 30, 2026, to maintain the strategy’s effectiveness. Jacqueline Power of Fidelity Investments Canada ULC told The Globe and Mail that the borrowing spouse should pay interest from an account in their name only to reduce the risk of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) challenging the transaction during an audit.

Other notable Canadian changes include an increase in the lifetime capital gains exemption to $1.275 million in 2026, and expanded trust reporting rules that will require “bare trusts” to file returns for 2026 and beyond, after exemptions for 2023 through 2025.

As both countries gear up for a busy and potentially confusing tax season, the message from experts is simple: take your time, get informed, and don’t let the rush to file early lead to costly mistakes. The evolving tax codes on both sides of the border offer new opportunities for savings and planning—but only for those who approach them with care and patience.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/5yI9n2EBWTLntNDg582JDyvrGd0=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F7be57d9f-1101-4be1-8b8f-bc8e15017c25.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 19:58:33.407779

Beyond air pollution, Formosa has a well-documented history of discharging preproduction plastic pellets—known as nurdles—into Lavaca Bay and surrounding waterways.","A proposed dam on the Lavaca River, some 100 miles southwest of Houston, would divert 31 billion gallons of water annually while threatening Lavaca Bay’s oyster reefs, fish populations, and an already contaminated ecosystem. The Lavaca-Navidad River Authority’s “Lake Texana Yield Enhancement Project” has faced massive opposition, with more than 500 public comments and contested case hearing requests submitted to TCEQ commissioners. As Texas regulators decide whether to grant public hearings or issue the permit outright, conservationists, fishermen, and community advocates are fighting to protect one of Texas’s last naturally flowing major rivers to the Gulf.

What the proposal does

The project would authorize the Lavaca-Navidad River Authority (LNRA) to divert approximately one-sixth of the river’s annual flow. This marks the first time in 50 years that the small river authority has sought additional water rights. It includes a diversion dam impounding 240 acre-feet on the Lavaca River and a massive off-channel reservoir on Keller Creek with 16 billion gallons of storage capacity. The reservoir would be built on land currently owned by Formosa Plastics, located approximately two miles east of the company’s Point Comfort chemical complex. Under the proposed arrangement, LNRA would purchase the land from Formosa, and the petrochemical giant would receive “first rights” to a portion of the water.

Two customers currently account for 98% of water sales agreements in the entire Lavaca-Navidad basin: the City of Corpus Christi and Formosa Plastics, consuming roughly equal amounts. The driving force for this expansion has been industry, as LNRA General Manager Patrick Brzozowski said: “There is interest in our area to develop industrial plants. That’s where the demand is going to come from.”

Throughout 2025, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has been reviewing the Lavaca-Navidad River Authority’s water permit application. Commissioners must decide whether to grant contested case hearings or issue the permit directly. If TCEQ grants the hearings, the project would proceed to the State Office of Administrative Hearings for proceedings that could delay construction for years. If commissioners issue the permit directly, construction could begin on a diversion dam and 2,500-acre off-channel reservoir that would fundamentally alter freshwater flows to Lavaca Bay.

Diane Wilson, an activist who won a historic $50 million settlement against Formosa Plastics in 2019, has emerged as a leading opponent of the dam. In August, Wilson won a lawsuit against the local school board over inadequate public notice ahead of a hearing on a tax abatement for a proposed $10 billion ExxonMobil plastics plant on Lavaca Bay. Then in October, ExxonMobil announced that it would postpone building that facility, telling the Texas Tribune that, “Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development.”

Opposition to the proposal

Diverting freshwater from the bay will harm coastal wildlife habitats. Estuaries like Lavaca Bay depend on freshwater inflows to maintain the salinity balance that supports fish, oysters, and other birds. The mixing of fresh water from the Lavaca River with salt water from the Gulf creates brackish conditions that are essential for these species to thrive. Texas Water Development Board studies show that the Lavaca River should contribute 346,200 acre-feet of freshwater annually to maintain healthy conditions in the bay. The proposed dam would divert 96,022 acre-feet—more than a quarter of that target amount—potentially seriously disrupting this balance and making the bay saltier.

Opposition to the dam has united a broad coalition of supporters. Conservation groups, including the National Wildlife Foundation, the Matagorda Bay Foundation, and the Coastal Conservation Association, are collaborating with fishing groups, Lavaca River Ranch, and Hilcorp Energy to oppose the project.

The Coastal Conservation Association in Texas has identified specific concerns with the permit application regarding the impacts of the diversion dam on freshwater inflows to Lavaca Bay. The reduced freshwater would harm numerous species that depend on the bay. These ecosystems are shaped by the salinity of their water. Diversion of freshwater could make these waters far saltier and through these ecosystems into chaos.

Oysters are particularly vulnerable. They thrive in brackish water with salinity between 10-30 parts per thousand (ppt) but cannot survive salinity below 5 ppt for more than a brief period. They are vital to the coastal ecosystem, filtering up to 50 gallons of water daily and providing shelter for more than 300 species in their reefs.

These changes would endanger birds as well. Redhead ducks winter in Matagorda Bay and feed on seagrass that requires the right salinity levels. Endangered whooping cranes rely on the bay’s blue crabs for food during migration.The livelihoods of many fishermen, shrimpers, and oyster harvesters depend entirely on maintaining the health of this coastal ecosystem.

How petrochemical expansion harms Texas’ environment

Beyond saltier waters potentially harming our wildlife, the dam will enable the expansion of petrochemical manufacturing and lead to more pollution of our environment. Formosa’s planned facilities would add approximately 167 tons of pollutants annually to the air. The company has already paid $2.85 million in fines for violations of the Clean Air Act, due to the release of chlorine and other hazardous substances.

Beyond air pollution, Formosa has a well-documented history of discharging preproduction plastic pellets—known as nurdles—into Lavaca Bay and surrounding waterways. Despite a 2019 settlement requiring zero discharge of plastics, the company has violated this agreement more than 700 times since 2019, accumulating millions in fines, according to the San Antonio Bay Estuarian Waterkeeper. These tiny plastic pellets contaminate beaches, are consumed by wildlife, and persist in the environment indefinitely.

What’s Next

Texans should not let LNRA expose our coastal ecosystems to unnecessary and detrimental plastic manufacturing. Our coast is worth protecting, and allowing this water diversion project will endanger more of Texas’s wildlife and natural beauty.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/center/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lavaca_river.png,N,,2026-01-05 22:59:35.823191

“The Deepwater Port Program is a key pillar of President Trump’s energy dominance strategy.
Going forward, MARAD will direct all federal environmental reviews for DWPA license applications, with an eye to efficiency.
Nor does MARAD have the resources—both human and financial—while the Coast Guard does.""","The Maritime Administration has taken over the environmental compliance process for ""deepwater port"" development from the U.S. Coast Guard, the two agencies announced Monday. The change covers offshore energy ports as defined by the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), which applies to fixed and floating oil and natural gas terminals in U.S. waters - for example, the familiar single-point moorings of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port. The Coast Guard says that the change will support the Trump administration's interest in boosting the American maritime and energy sectors.

“The Deepwater Port Program is a key pillar of President Trump’s energy dominance strategy. With this change, we’ll soon accelerate project approvals so the nation can safely utilize more of its abundant natural resources, create more high paying jobs, and lower energy costs for American families,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement.

Previously, the U.S. Coast Guard's administrative staff handled National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting for DWPA port applications, which have increased in number in recent years. The NEPA process, better known by the name of its most formal product, the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), is the most comprehensive environmental review applied to federal permitting actions.

Across the government, the median time to complete an EIS process currently averages about two years, according to the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. Overall DWPA permitting timelines have recently run much longer: the Texas GulfLink oil terminal project took six years from filing to approval.

Going forward, MARAD will direct all federal environmental reviews for DWPA license applications, with an eye to efficiency. The USCG will keep its maritime safety and security role, with oversight over design, construction and operation of new deepwater ports.

In a statement, the USCG noted that the change was required by Congress in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025, which redefines MARAD as the lead agency for NEPA reviews of deepwater port projects.

MARAD has received 31 license applications for deepwater DWPA projects since 1974, of which 11 have been approved, according to the agency's public list.

In an op-ed last year, former MARAD chief counsel Jeff Lewis (now an attorney in private practice with Cozen O’Connor) warned that transferring the responsibility for deepwater port environmental review to MARAD would be ill-advised. The existing division of labor complemented both, without the risk of overburdening MARAD, he suggested.

The artificial, unnecessary cost of all this red tape has hampered the growth of nuclear energy and raised the price of nuclear energy to the consumer.
So while rising energy prices cause rising costs of goods, falling energy prices correlate to falling prices of goods.
Cheap energy is good for America and Americans all-around, and nuclear energy presents a largely untapped means of acquiring cheap energy.
Republicans have a pivotal opportunity in 2026 to make nuclear energy a key part of their affordability platform.","Americans support nuclear energy. According to a recent poll by Pew Research, 59% of Americans want to build more nuclear power plants to meet our growing energy needs, and that number has been steadily rising over the last 5 years. In the 1950s, when nuclear energy had just been discovered, we seemed poised to harness the power of the atom and provide abundant, cheap energy to everyone. But since then, the Federal government has burdened nuclear power plants with more and more permitting and red tape.

The artificial, unnecessary cost of all this red tape has hampered the growth of nuclear energy and raised the price of nuclear energy to the consumer. Energy is essential to industry, and changes in energy prices are the first domino to fall in a series of related price changes that alter the final price of everything we buy. So while rising energy prices cause rising costs of goods, falling energy prices correlate to falling prices of goods. Cheap energy is good for America and Americans all-around, and nuclear energy presents a largely untapped means of acquiring cheap energy.

Fortunately, President Trump has given us a model for affordable nuclear energy that Republicans can build on and fully adopt in 2026. The President signed several executive orders in 2025 to streamline the regulatory process and build more power plants. These orders shorten the wait time for bureaucratic approval to just 18 months, rather than several years, and set a target to quadruple nuclear power generation by 2050. His executive orders also start the process to recycle old nuclear fuel, a process that can re-use nuclear waste while removing more than 90% of the radioactivity, contributing to safer and cleaner energy. CPAC’s Center for Regulatory Freedom filed comments with the Trump Administration in September and November supporting efforts to make it easier to develop nuclear power innovations in America.

The President’s executive orders follow decades of Republican support for cheap nuclear power, but that was often hindered by Democrat interference. In 2002, Congress selected Yucca Mountain to be the site of a huge, highly secure storage facility for 77,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel. Political intervention led by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid destroyed the project. Barack Obama promised to kill the Yucca Mountain project while he was on the campaign trail in 2008, and he cut off funding in 2010. Since the Federal government did not build the storage facility that it promised, it now has to pay billions of dollars per year to nuclear reactor companies to keep their spent fuel onsite. Thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel are sitting in secure canisters on the premises of nuclear plants, with nowhere to go because Democrats prevented the storage facility from being built.

Some Democrats have gone even further; in addition to wanting to stop new nuclear power plants from being built, they want to destroy the power plants that we already have. In April 2021, Chuck Schumer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and other New York Democrats forced the Indian Point Nuclear Plant in New York City to shut down even though it could have continued to operate for at least 20 more years. Before the plant shut down, it produced enough electricity to power one million homes. To be clear, if you're a leftist and are advocating for carbon-free energy generation, supposedly because of climate change, and you're not advocating for nuclear power generation, then you really don't believe in carbon-free energy. You’re just anti-technology.

Recent polling shows that Democrats’ anti-nuclear stance is out of touch with the majority of Americans. 69% of Republicans and even 52% of Democrats want to build more nuclear power plants. When the average American household spends nearly $150 every month on electricity, it’s no surprise that Americans are supportive of cheaper forms of energy. Republicans have a pivotal opportunity in 2026 to make nuclear energy a key part of their affordability platform. The nuclear energy issue highlights how Republicans have been working to advance science and technology while Democrats have obstructed technological progress and made life harder for ordinary Americans.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b5d67b_b021a7ec64c74b2e80edf58d94248379~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/b5d67b_b021a7ec64c74b2e80edf58d94248379~mv2.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 20:58:48.485637

The social listening feature is purpose-built for policy professionals, moving beyond general social monitoring to provide actionable policy intelligence. The platform is specifically designed to track and analyze the social media activity of U.S. federal and state lawmakers and executives.

Ultimately, social media listening tools equip policy teams to be proactive, not reactive. You can spot which members of Congress or other legislators are the most vocal champions or opponents on an issue, see where misinformation is spreading, and refine your messaging before a bill even reaches the floor.

This type of deep, contextual intelligence is a critical piece of a complete policy strategy, allowing you to connect the digital debate to the legislative process and move your objectives forward with greater certainty.

Imagine your organization is focused on a major infrastructure bill currently being debated in the House.

Set Up Listening: Instead of just searching for the bill number, your team uses the best social listening tools to track several key phrases: ""infrastructure modernization,"" ""clean energy grid,"" and the bill's official title.

Monitor Sentiment: The platform aggregates posts and applies natural language processing to categorize the mood or tone as positive, negative, or neutral.

Take Action: This real-time shift in sentiment serves as a critical alert. Your team can now:

Inform strategy: Advise your government affairs team when a specific section is a major point of friction that needs immediate attention.

Refine messaging: Draft talking points to counteract the negative narratives before they gain more traction.

Target outreach: Identify which committee staffers or key influencers are driving the negative discussion and engage them directly.

This process moves beyond simple tracking of mentions to provide actionable intelligence on the legislative environment.

Social listening software is a platform that uses sophisticated technology, like AI, to analyze online conversations at scale and is more strategic than simple monitoring.

For policy professionals, this is not just about tracking mentions of your organization. It is about understanding the broader public sentiment and dialogue surrounding brand mentions,legislation, regulatory changes, or key policy issues as they unfold in real time across social media channels like X, Bluesky, and other platforms.

For those focused on government affairs and advocacy, social listening tools serve as a digital early warning system. This reveals trends in public opinion, flags emerging threats or opportunities for engagement, and helps gauge the momentum of an issue. The goal is to collect this unstructured digital chatter and transform it into a set of actionable insights that directly inform legislative tracking, stakeholder outreach, and communication strategy.",https://fiscalnote-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Facebook-LinkedIn.png?mtime=1766416075,N,,2026-01-05 16:13:34.321951

Louisiana is the first state to earn back-to-back top honors.

The recognition builds on record economic momentum and positions Louisiana for sustained growth and national leadership in 2026.

BATON ROUGE, La. – Louisiana has earned Business Facilities’ Platinum Deal of the Year for the second consecutive year, with Hyundai Steel’s $5.8 billion investment in Ascension Parish recognized as the nation’s most significant development announcement of 2025. With this selection, Louisiana becomes the first in the award’s history to receive consecutive Platinum honors.

“In 2025, Louisiana set a new standard for ourselves. This year, we are setting a new standard for the nation, and that starts with the unprecedented back-to-back Platinum Deal of the Year wins,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “Louisiana is a force in the industries that power America’s economy. Our workforce, our business climate and our commitment to growth are giving companies every reason to invest here with confidence. Louisiana is rising to meet the moment, and the nation is taking notice.”

Business Facilities’ Deal of the Year Awards highlight projects that demonstrate significant capital investment, job creation, innovation and community impact. Hyundai Steel’s investment was selected for the 2025 Platinum Award for its national importance and the coordinated statewide efforts that advanced a project of this magnitude.

The honor follows Louisiana’s 2024 Platinum award for the Meta AI data center and signals the growing scale and prominence of the projects choosing the state.

“Back-to-back Platinum Deal of the Year wins signal an undeniable shift for Louisiana,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “We’ve moved from aspiration to achievement, building a climate where world-class projects choose Louisiana because they know we can deliver. This recognition affirms that Louisiana has entered a new era of competitiveness and success for our state.”

Hyundai Steel will build an ultra-low-carbon steel mill on a 1,700-acre site in Donaldsonville, anchoring future development within the RiverPlex MegaPark. The project, announced in March 2025 at the White House, is expected to generate more than 5,400 job opportunities in the Capital Region. Centered around River Parish Community College’s new Westbank training center, Louisiana’s workforce partners are preparing residents for advanced manufacturing roles and providing a reliable, long-term talent pipeline for the region.

“Being named Platinum Deal of the Year recognizes the extraordinary scale of the Hyundai Steel manufacturing facility and the years of groundwork required to bring an investment of this magnitude to this point,” President & CEO of the Greater Baton Rouge Economic Partnership Lori Melancon said. “This project is the result of more than a decade of collaboration, planning, and site development. Strong and seamless public-private sector partnerships are what make transformative projects like this possible. The Hyundai Steel facility in Ascension Parish is just the beginning of the impact that the RiverPlex MegaPark will have on Louisiana’s Capital Region.”

The Hyundai Steel project demonstrates the kind of major investment Louisiana is prepared to support. Advancing an investment of this magnitude required strong coordination and steady direction to move the project forward and demonstrated the state’s capacity to meet the expectations of global companies. Business Facilities’ recognition highlights the quality of this work and the confidence it provides to companies exploring opportunities in Louisiana.

“We are excited to share the stories of these top Deals of the Year,” Business Facilities Editorial Director Anne Cosgrove said. “From Hyundai Steel choosing Louisiana to build the first fully integrated steel mill to be built in the U.S. in more than 60 years to Amkor Technology propelling the semiconductor boom in Arizona, these investments represent significant momentum in high-growth sectors. In Virginia, the new Hitachi Energy plant will deliver on energy infrastructure needs while Wistron’s investment in its new Texas operations opens up opportunities in that region. We congratulate the economic development teams that worked to bring these projects to fruition.”

The award follows Louisiana’s record-breaking year where the state saw its largest year of investment and direct job creation in state history. Together, these achievements signal a stronger, more competitive Louisiana positioned for sustained growth in the year ahead.

Now, the Virginia-headquartered company is headed back before state utility regulators seeking to raise base electric rates again.
Dominion’s ask comes on the heels of rate hikes approved for Duke Energy customers across the Upstate and Pee Dee.
And electricity costs have been on the rise nationally, not just in South Carolina.
The provision is aimed at the growing number of large data centers and manufacturing operations coming into South Carolina.","COLUMBIA — Customers of South Carolina’s two large, private power companies could see their electric bills go up in 2026 — the second time in two years that utilities have hiked base rates.

It has been 16 months since Dominion Energy’s South Carolina customers last saw their rates increase. Now, the Virginia-headquartered company is headed back before state utility regulators seeking to raise base electric rates again.

If approved by the state Public Service Commission, residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month — considered the industry standard — would see another $20 tacked on to their current monthly bill, Dominion’s regulatory manager John Raftery told the SC Daily Gazette. That would take average bills from about $157 a month to just shy of $177, starting in July 2026.

This does not include potential increases for cost of fuel, which can be added to bills along the way.

Dominion’s ask comes on the heels of rate hikes approved for Duke Energy customers across the Upstate and Pee Dee.

And electricity costs have been on the rise nationally, not just in South Carolina.

Utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first nine months of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills. That’s almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024.

The national average price of electricity rose faster than inflation in 2025, and government forecasters at the U.S. Energy Information Administration expect that will continue through this year. But the increases have not hit as hard in South Carolina and many other Southeastern states when compared to the West Coast and Northeast.

Dominion is asking for the increase, which would bring in $332 million more annually from all 820,000 customers it serves across the Lowcountry and Midlands. Utility officials say that will help cover $1.4 billion worth of investments made to the utility’s South Carolina system since March 2024.

That includes:

$500 million spent on the lines that carry power directly to people’s homes and businesses

$270 million spent on large transmission lines that move power around the state

$515 million on power plants and hydropower produced at Lake Murray

$120 million on Hurricane Helene recovery

Utilities’ annual spending on the network of poles and wires that deliver power to customers has nearly tripled over the past two decades, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, as large portions of the electric grid near the end of their 50-year life spans. As climate change drives more frequent storms, fires, heat waves, and cold spells, companies also are having to do more to make the grid more resistant to natural disasters.

Some of those improvements to the transmission lines and a coal-fired power plant near Goose Creek are required by federal energy and environmental regulations, said Keller Kissam, president of Dominion’s South Carolina operations.

Others replace smaller, aging plants that are six decades old and hydro equipment that hasn’t been updated in nearly a century, Kissam added.

Dominion’s spending over the last two years is nearly equivalent to the $1.6 billion it spent in the five years prior. Kissam pointed, in part, to the rising cost of copper, steel and aluminum — all of which goes into the parts and components the utility uses in its power lines and equipment. The company also has added 23,000 new customers in that time.

“I would rather fight a Category 4 hurricane than file a rate case,” Kissam said.

But the company also is collecting less than half of the 9.94% rate of return regulators allowed it in 2024. That rate of return is how Dominion attracts investors willing to front the capital the company needs for construction, Kissam said.

Dominion is, in turn, asking regulators to up that return rate to 10.5%.

Duke Energy

As for Duke Energy, the average residential customer in the Pee Dee will see their bill rise by about $11 a month — from $154 to $165 for 1,000 kilowatt-hours of energy — starting in February. State utility regulators signed off on the rate hike on Dec. 12.

The increase for customers in the Upstate, approved Dec. 31, is far less — less than $1 more per month on average starting in March. But those customers still have a bump that has yet to take effect from a previously approved rate hike. That increase of $6.42 per month for the average residential customer comes in Aug. 1, 2026.

In all, Duke has about 857,000 customers in the Palmetto State.

As part of the deal, Duke will set aside funds, raised from investors, for customers who need help paying their bill when facing financial hardship — $750,000 annually for two years in the Pee Dee and $1.5 million annually for two years in the Upstate, according to the South Carolina chapter of the AARP.

Duke also agreed to take part in a petition asking regulators to review how large energy users — those that consume 50 megawatts or more — are charged for producing the power they require. The provision is aimed at the growing number of large data centers and manufacturing operations coming into South Carolina.

In turn, regulators are allowing Duke a 9.99% rate of return.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/electric-meter-1024x7521767643335.jpeg?h=93bab6c8&itok=-lFVm1d8,N,,2026-01-05 16:13:49.000885

The final EJ Policy is not only a milestone in updating the over 20-year-old policy, but will be used to guide DEP protections for communities most vulnerable to environmental challenges.

“Vulnerable communities exist in every region of the Commonwealth — rural and urban alike. This updated policy builds on DEP’s commitment to proactively educate, engage, and empower Pennsylvanians living in EJ areas,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “Addressing environmental justice challenges is part of our mission, and with this policy, we are demonstrating our commitment to protecting the environment for all of Pennsylvania’s communities.”

The updated EJ policy directs how DEP's inspection, compliance, and enforcement efforts can better include criteria and concerns of Pennsylvania communities most at risk from pollution and other environmental impacts. Furthermore, the policy outlines the ways in which DEP plans to increase outreach across Pennsylvania and build long-lasting relationships with communities impacted by environmental challenges.

In 2023, DEP announced an interim final policy and collected feedback from communities throughout Pennsylvania. During the extensive comment period, DEP received over 700 comments which were extensively reviewed and are addressed in a Comment Response Document.

The updated policy will continue to place a large emphasis on public participation and proactive conversations among DEP’s EJ staff that have been engaging with communities in designated environmental justice areas, based on 32 environmental, health, and socioeconomic indicators. This enhanced public participation helps to improve environmental safeguards for communities without extending beyond existing statute or regulation by empowering Pennsylvanians to learn more about specific projects and the environmental factors impacting their communities, and help those seeking a permit to better understand community concerns. This engagement allows DEP to be more efficient when receiving public comment, improving permitting processes.

Upon taking office, Governor Josh Shapiro elevated environmental justice by creating the first Special Deputy Secretary for Environmental Justice position and growing the office by adding an Environmental Justice coordinator to each of DEP’s six regional offices.

DEP has also updated PennEnviroScreen(opens in a new tab), a state-of-the-art mapping tool used to identify EJ areas across Pennsylvania, using the most updated data available and the 2020 Census geographical boundaries. It is more user-friendly, with clearer visual outlines, short data descriptions of all the environmental justice indicators, and more useful data supplements to allow Pennsylvanians to use PennEnviroScreen for education, research, local governance, and community development. This approach, in the environmental justice context, continues to help DEP improve permitting processes while continuing to cut down on wait times.

Follow the Money,Melissa Yu,,,,,https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2026/01/why-are-realtors-associations-fighting-clean-air-standards-follow-money,"Unsurprisingly, the fossil fuel industry and its allies are hoping to use this process to roll back these clean air standards entirely.
But some of the loudest voices pushing to roll back clean air standards in the Bay Area might not be who you'd expect.
But political organizations funded primarily by Realtor associations are accepting money from the very industries that have the most to lose from California's clean energy standards, while realtor associations are leading voices fighting those standards.
What's Really at Stake When Bay Area Realtor associations oppose clean air standards that would upgrade homes with heat pumps, they're claiming to protect homeowners' interests.
The fact that Realtor associations are fighting them—while political associations funded primarily by realtors are simultaneously accepting money from oil and gas companies—deserves scrutiny from policymakers and the public alike.","The Bay Area Air District adopted groundbreaking standards in 2023 that will help accelerate adoption of efficient electric heat pumps, cutting deadly air pollution and making energy bills more affordable. The standards will only apply when existing fossil fuel equipment needs replacement and will phase in gradually starting in 2027 for water heaters and 2029 for furnaces.

Ahead of the 2027 implementation date, the Air District is working to amend these rules to incorporate flexibility measures. Unsurprisingly, the fossil fuel industry and its allies are hoping to use this process to roll back these clean air standards entirely.

But some of the loudest voices pushing to roll back clean air standards in the Bay Area might not be who you'd expect. They’re coming from the Realtor associations.

At first glance, it makes no sense. These rules were designed to gradually upgrade homes with energy efficient, money-saving heat pumps to reduce air pollution in a region with some of the dirtiest air in the country. And homebuyers' interest in energy-efficient technologies is growing, according to the National Association for Realtors (NAR).

So why would these Realtor associations—organizations that claim to champion housing affordability and environmental sustainability—be fighting tooth and nail against these standards?

The answer, as usual, is money.

The Fossil Fuel Connection

Realtor associations say they oppose the Bay Area Air District's emissions limits because they worry about costs to homeowners. But a closer look at their funding sources raises questions about their real motives.

In the 2024 election cycle, California Alliance for Progress and Education—a group working to influence state assembly and senate races that is funded primarily by the California Association of Realtors (CAR)—took in $250,000 from a PAC funded by business interests including Chevron. That same year, Keep California Golden, another shadowy group primarily funded by California Realtors, received $75,000 from a PAC backed by oil and gas companies and Sempra, the parent company of Southern California's gas utility.

The timing is hard to ignore. While CAR claims on its website that it ""is doing its part to become a more environmentally friendly organization and will lead the way toward a greener world,"" the organization simultaneously backs front groups that accept substantial funding for their political work from fossil fuel interests while opposing clean air standards that would encourage heat pump adoption. Whether this funding directly finances Realtor associations’ current campaign in the Bay Area is unclear. But political organizations funded primarily by Realtor associations are accepting money from the very industries that have the most to lose from California's clean energy standards, while realtor associations are leading voices fighting those standards.

Many individual Realtors have no idea this is happening. They pay dues to their associations without realizing those dollars are funding this work, or that their organizations are working with fossil fuel companies. The alignment alone is striking enough to warrant serious scrutiny.

The Bigger Pattern: Claiming to Care About Housing Affordability While Opposing Key Policy Reform to Lower Costs

The fossil fuel funding ties aren’t the only place where Realtor associations' actions contradict their stated values. The same organizations that say they care about housing affordability have systematically opposed policies that would actually make homes more affordable.

Realtor associations regularly claim housing affordability as a top priority. CAR, which represents about 190,000 Realtors and brings in roughly $58 million a year, presents itself as a champion of homeownership and housing access through Californians for Homeownership, the group's legal arm that files lawsuits it says are intended to pave the way for housing development.

But as Los Angeles housing advocate Thomas Irwin pointed out in the San Francisco Chronicle, the CAR are some of the most stringent opponents of affordable housing reform. This year alone, CAR opposed at least two bills aimed at increasing California's housing stock by allowing more multifamily homes in residential neighborhoods. When AB 647 made it onto the agenda—a bill that would have expanded multifamily housing and designated affordable housing—CAR brought 2,200 members to Sacramento to lobby against it. The organization took credit when the bill was pulled from consideration. CAR also opposed SB 677, which would have expanded laws allowing multifamily homes in residential neighborhoods.

Instead of backing policies that increase housing supply, CAR has repeatedly spent enormous sums supporting measures that primarily benefit wealthy homeowners.

In 2018, they sponsored Proposition 5, which would have given substantial property tax breaks to older homeowners moving to more expensive homes—putting younger and less wealthy buyers at a disadvantage while reducing funds for schools and other local services by $1 billion a year. CAR and NAR spent $13.2 million supporting it, but voters rejected the measure.

Then, in 2020, Realtor associations spent $62.2 million supporting Proposition 19, a similar measure that provided property tax breaks for wealthy homeowners by removing tax benefits for inherited properties. That measure narrowly passed. The pattern is clear: Realtor associations will spend whatever it takes to secure tax breaks for wealthy homeowners, even when doing so drains resources from public schools and makes homeownership less accessible to lower-income families.

Blocking Tenant Protections

CAR's contradictions don't stop with housing development. The organization has also teamed up with landlord associations to block even modest tenant protections.

Last year, CAR and NAR spent $27 million supporting an effort to oppose Proposition 33, a ballot measure that would have expanded local governments' abilities to impose rent controls. After the wildfires displaced thousands of families in the Los Angeles area earlier this year, CAR worked with landlord groups to oppose a proposal to freeze rents for a year after the disaster—a proposal that would have helped displaced residents stabilize and recover.

CAR even opposed a bill requiring landlords to maintain working refrigerators and stoves in rental units.

All together, these positions reveal a clear priority: protecting landlords' profits matters more than protecting renters' basic living conditions.

Who's Really Pulling the Strings?

To understand why Realtor associations are willing to contradict their stated values, it helps to understand the scope of their political power—and who benefits from it.

The National Association of Realtors spent $86.3 million on federal lobbying last year, more than any other organization in the country. CAR brings in about $58 million annually and directs at least a third of its membership dues toward lobbying and political activity. That's money that individual Realtors often contribute without realizing where it goes.

And it doesn’t stop at housing policy. Realtor PACs have spent millions supporting election deniers, anti-abortion rights, and organizations fighting environmental protections. NAR has funneled millions through a dark money group called American Property Owners Alliance to fund causes having nothing to do with real estate—causes that many of its own members may oppose.

Individual Realtors Are Caught in the Middle

None of this is the fault of individual real estate agents. Most Realtors care about their communities and want to sell homes in healthy neighborhoods with clean air. But they're forced to be dues-paying members of realtor associations that use dues to fund political causes—causes that often contradict the Realtors' own stated values.

This creates an uncomfortable situation for Realtors who genuinely care about clean energy, housing affordability, and democracy. They're part of an organization claiming to champion these values while it is simultaneously spending their dues to undermine them.

What's Really at Stake

When Bay Area Realtor associations oppose clean air standards that would upgrade homes with heat pumps, they're claiming to protect homeowners' interests. But their ties to political funding from fossil fuel companies—combined with their alignment with the industry’s agenda—raise legitimate concerns about whose interests they're actually serving.

When CAR opposes housing expansion bills and tenant protections while claiming to care about affordability, the disconnect between the organization's stated values and its actual priorities is hard to ignore.

The Bay Area's heat pump standards would lower energy bills and improve home efficiency while reducing air pollution. They're good policy by any measure. The fact that Realtor associations are fighting them—while political associations funded primarily by realtors are simultaneously accepting money from oil and gas companies—deserves scrutiny from policymakers and the public alike.

As California debates the next generation of climate and housing policy, one question should be front and center: when Realtor associations warn that a policy will hurt their members, are they truly speaking for those members—or for landlords, wealthy homeowners, fossil fuel interests, and conservative political allies?

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) closed 2025 with mixed results, as US fourth-quarter deliveries fell amid a steep drop in electric vehicle (EV) demand, even as the automaker posted industry-leading full-year sales.

US deliveries in Q4 declined about 7% year-on-year to 703,001 vehicles, with EV sales hit hardest. GM delivered 25,219 EVs, down 43% after federal tax credits for new EV purchases expired in September. Newer EV models faced sharp declines: Equinox EV sales fell 72%, while Blazer EV dropped 77%, underscoring near-term challenges for mass-market EV adoption.

In response, GM is refocusing on affordability. The next-generation Bolt EV, set to launch in Q1 2026 with a starting price of $29,990, aims to attract budget-conscious buyers. The original Bolt had been one of GM’s best-selling EVs until its discontinuation in late 2023.

The automaker has already scaled back its EV ambitions, taking a $1.6 billion charge in October related to reduced EV capacity, with further write-downs expected. “We continue managing our EV business to protect our brands and products. Our EV incentives remain approximately half the industry average,” GM said in a statement.

Despite the quarterly dip, GM ended 2025 on a high note. Full-year US sales rose 6%, with growth across all four brands. GM led America’s full-size pickup market for the sixth straight year, with Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra posting their best combined sales in 20 years, and held the top spot in full-size SUVs for the 51st consecutive year. GM was also the industry’s number two EV seller in 2025.

Highlights included record sales for GMC, a decade-high for Cadillac, best-ever results for Chevrolet SUVs, and Buick emerging as one of the fastest-growing mainstream brands. Nearly 700,000 Chevrolet and Buick vehicles were sold under $30,000, while GM Envolve fleet and commercial sales rose 8%.

“Demand for our brands and products is strong at every price point, and we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in the year ahead,” said Duncan Aldred, GM senior VP and president of North America.

It explains how third-party litigation funding can play a significant role in advancing environmental causes.
It should be no surprise then that the broader trends show TPLF fueling climate litigation against American energy companies, where funders help plaintiffs seek damages for alleged climate damages.
Third-party litigation funding has quietly turned America’s judicial system into a high-return investment opportunity for foreign entities, with the energy sector particularly exposed.","Third-party litigation funding (TPLF) involves outside investors providing nonrecourse funding to plaintiffs in exchange for a share of any settlement or judgment, treating it as a high-return alternative asset class in a multibillion-dollar industry. The loophole stems from structuring these arrangements as “prepaid forward contracts,” which qualify as derivatives under tax rules (IRC §1234A), enabling capital gains treatment rather than ordinary income. Crucially, for nonresident aliens and foreign corporations, such capital gains are generally not subject to U.S. withholding tax or treated as effectively connected income (ECI) if there’s no U.S. presence, meaning foreign funders can extract profits from U.S. court outcomes entirely tax-free.

The energy industry faces particularly acute risks from this practice. High-stakes disputes have surged over climate change claims, intellectual property in emerging technologies, mergers, joint ventures, and environmental regulations. The litigation finance market has exploded, with commercial funding assets estimated at around $16 billion in recent years and projections for continued rapid growth. Yet most funding arrangements remain secret, with courts, defendants, and the public unaware of outside backers or their potential control over cases. In contrast, U.S. plaintiffs typically face ordinary income taxation on the full recovery amount.

Foreign investors, including sovereign wealth funds and entities from adversarial nations, have poured significant capital into U.S. energy-related litigation. This raises serious national security concerns: prolonged suits can harass American energy firms, tie them up in expensive proceedings, access sensitive proprietary information through discovery, weaken domestic production, and advance foreign geopolitical agendas.

A prominent recent example unfolded in early 2025, when ExxonMobil filed a federal countersuit in Texas against California Attorney General Rob Bonta, several U.S. environmental nonprofits, and the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund (IEJF). The IEJF is an Australian nonprofit linked to billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation. The original lawsuit, brought by California in 2024, accused ExxonMobil of misleading the public about the recyclability of its plastics as part of broader low-carbon and energy transition efforts.

ExxonMobil alleged that IEJF, tied to Forrest’s Fortescue company, a direct competitor in hydrogen markets, provided foreign funding to orchestrate the litigation and associated public criticism for competitive advantage. This prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to require the plaintiffs’ law firm to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). ExxonMobil’s countersuit claims defamation, business disparagement, tortious interference, and civil conspiracy, arguing that such foreign-backed funding weaponizes U.S. courts against American energy companies, harming workers, consumers, and national interests.

Additionally, environmental activists have found a lifeboat for advancing their unpopular policy agenda through the TPLF. Last month, Nature Sustainability published an article titled “Leveraging third-party litigation funding for environmental litigation,” authored by Masaki Iwasaki from Seoul National University. It explains how third-party litigation funding can play a significant role in advancing environmental causes. It should be no surprise then that the broader trends show TPLF fueling climate litigation against American energy companies, where funders help plaintiffs seek damages for alleged climate damages. Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, a total of 86 climate lawsuits have been filed against the world’s largest oil, gas, and coal companies. The annual number of cases brought against fossil fuel corporations has nearly tripled over this period.

Third-party litigation funding has quietly turned America’s judicial system into a high-return investment opportunity for foreign entities, with the energy sector particularly exposed. Foreign capital, including from sovereign wealth funds and entities linked to geopolitical competitors, flows into these cases, often in secrecy and with the potential to harass U.S. energy firms, access sensitive information, prolong costly litigation, and advance external agendas. In 2026, Congress should look for ways to close the tax loophole that allows foreign investors to extract tax-free gains from U.S. litigation proceeds to prevent the weaponization of American judicial processes against domestic energy producers and critical infrastructure.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dolla-Dolla-Bills.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 17:59:42.877590

It has been 16 months since Dominion Energy’s South Carolina customers last saw their rates increase. Now, the Virginia-headquartered company is headed back before state utility regulators seeking to raise base electric rates again.

If approved by the state Public Service Commission, residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month — considered the industry standard — would see another $20 tacked on to their current monthly bill, Dominion’s regulatory manager John Raftery told the SC Daily Gazette. That would take average bills from about $157 a month to just shy of $177, starting in July 2026.

This does not include potential increases for cost of fuel, which can be added to bills along the way.

Dominion’s ask comes on the heels of rate hikes approved for Duke Energy customers across the Upstate and Pee Dee.

And electricity costs have been on the rise nationally, not just in South Carolina.

Utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first nine months of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills. That’s almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024.

The national average price of electricity rose faster than inflation in 2025, and government forecasters at the U.S. Energy Information Administration expect that will continue through this year. But the increases have not hit as hard in South Carolina and many other Southeastern states when compared to the West Coast and Northeast.

Dominion is asking for the increase, which would bring in $332 million more annually from all 820,000 customers it serves across the Lowcountry and Midlands. Utility officials say that will help cover $1.4 billion worth of investments made to the utility’s South Carolina system since March 2024.

That includes:

$500 million spent on the lines that carry power directly to people’s homes and businesses

$270 million spent on large transmission lines that move power around the state

$515 million on power plants and hydropower produced at Lake Murray

$120 million on Hurricane Helene recovery

Utilities’ annual spending on the network of poles and wires that deliver power to customers has nearly tripled over the past two decades, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, as large portions of the electric grid near the end of their 50-year life spans. As climate change drives more frequent storms, fires, heat waves, and cold spells, companies also are having to do more to make the grid more resistant to natural disasters.

Some of those improvements to the transmission lines and a coal-fired power plant near Goose Creek are required by federal energy and environmental regulations, said Keller Kissam, president of Dominion’s South Carolina operations.

Others replace smaller, aging plants that are six decades old and hydro equipment that hasn’t been updated in nearly a century, Kissam added.

Dominion’s spending over the last two years is nearly equivalent to the $1.6 billion it spent in the five years prior. Kissam pointed, in part, to the rising cost of copper, steel and aluminum — all of which goes into the parts and components the utility uses in its power lines and equipment. The company also has added 23,000 new customers in that time.

“I would rather fight a Category 4 hurricane than file a rate case,” Kissam said.

But the company also is collecting less than half of the 9.94% rate of return regulators allowed it in 2024. That rate of return is how Dominion attracts investors willing to front the capital the company needs for construction, Kissam said.

Dominion is, in turn, asking regulators to up that return rate to 10.5%.

Duke Energy

As for Duke Energy, the average residential customer in the Pee Dee will see their bill rise by about $11 a month — from $154 to $165 for 1,000 kilowatt-hours of energy — starting in February. State utility regulators signed off on the rate hike on Dec. 12.

The increase for customers in the Upstate, approved Dec. 31, is far less — less than $1 more per month on average starting in March. But those customers still have a bump that has yet to take effect from a previously approved rate hike. That increase of $6.42 per month for the average residential customer comes in Aug. 1, 2026.

In all, Duke has about 857,000 customers in the Palmetto State.

As part of the deal, Duke will set aside funds, raised from investors, for customers who need help paying their bill when facing financial hardship — $750,000 annually for two years in the Pee Dee and $1.5 million annually for two years in the Upstate, according to the South Carolina chapter of the AARP.

Duke also agreed to take part in a petition asking regulators to review how large energy users — those that consume 50 megawatts or more — are charged for producing the power they require. The provision is aimed at the growing number of large data centers and manufacturing operations coming into South Carolina.

In turn, regulators are allowing Duke a 9.99% rate of return.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/electric-meter.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 15:13:22.172554

These savings represent what participating businesses stand to save before they transition into final vendor contracts.

“Supporting the economic vitality of the South Side has always been central to our mission, and the Shared Purchasing Network is a powerful example of what’s possible when we listen to and partner with local small business owners,” said Valerie Jarrett, CEO of The Obama Foundation. “By working with Emerald South to design this initiative from the ground up, we helped create a more inclusive, accessible way for entrepreneurs to reduce their costs and strengthen their operations. These savings aren’t just numbers—they represent real resources that small businesses can reinvest in their employees, their growth, and their communities.”

To date, more than 75 South Side small businesses and nonprofit organizations have joined the SPN, which leverages collective buying power to negotiate better contract terms and lower rates for core operational goods and services. Among the organizations that received quotes for new waste, recycling and composting contracts through that first bid process, 16 organizations with potential savings greater than 40 percent and 9 organizations had potential savings of more than 50 percent, including one at 89 percent.

“The early results from this first RFP confirm that this model works in Chicago,” said Ghian Foreman, president and CEO of the Emerald South Economic Development Collaborative. “When a local nonprofit or neighborhood business can cut a core bill by 40 or 50 percent based on competitive bids, that can be the difference between reducing hours and growing their staff. With the Obama Foundation anchoring the pool, we are showing that institutions and local businesses can move together and share the benefits.”

Developed in close collaboration with The Obama Foundation, Emerald South launched the SPN in 2025 after convening local small business owners, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders to identify the most essential services for inclusion in the SPN and to design a more inclusive, accessible procurement process. The Foundation also serves as the anchor program participant and will use the SPN when the Obama Presidential Center opens in 2026.

“Most of the business owners we work with are managing a lot on their own, and they rarely have time to renegotiate or shop around for a better waste contract,” said Rhonda McFarland, executive director of the Quad Communities Development Corporation. “Through the Shared Purchasing Network, they are seeing multiple bids lined up next to each other, often with significantly lower costs and better terms. That frees up money they can put back into their storefronts, into hiring, and into serving their customers.”

Small businesses and nonprofits across Chicago can participate in the Shared Purchasing Network, with Emerald South and community partners focusing outreach on owners in historically under-resourced communities where operating costs are a significant constraint. Emerald South anticipates adding services, such as insurance, security, natural gas, and more in the months ahead.

""Through the Shared Purchasing Network, Green Era was able to partner with Obama Presidential Center to recycle the center's food waste, transforming kitchen scraps and spoiled food into clean energy, clean soil, and jobs on Chicago's South Side, said Jason Feldman, Co-Founder at Green Era. ""We see this as a practical way for local employers to save money and invest in their communities at the same time.""

The Shared Purchasing Network is managed in partnership with Community Purchasing Alliance, a Washington, D.C.-based cooperative that has operated similar shared purchasing programs for more than a decade. Capital One provided financial support for Emerald South’s costs for the initiative, including building the Shared Purchasing Network website and technology platform, which streamlines intake, data collection, and competitive bidding for Chicago organizations.

Key stakeholders, including the U.S. State Department and major energy conglomerates, have already begun discussing a ""Marshall Plan"" for Venezuelan oil.
Conclusion: A Structural Reset for the Energy Sector The events of early January 2026 mark a turning point in the history of the energy market.
While the geopolitical landscape remains complex, the economic signal from the Gulf Coast is clear: the energy refining sector is entering a new era of dominance.","The first trading day of 2026 opened with a seismic shift in the energy markets as shares of major U.S. refiners skyrocketed following the dramatic military intervention in Venezuela. On Monday, January 5, 2026, investors flocked to the refining sector, betting that a U.S.-led transition in Caracas will unlock a steady, discounted flow of heavy-sour crude that has been largely restricted for years. Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) led the charge, with its stock price jumping nearly 8% in early trading, signaling a profound market expectation that the ""structural reset"" of the Venezuelan oil industry will provide a massive windfall for Gulf Coast refiners.

The immediate implications of the military action, codenamed ""Operation Absolute Resolve,"" are twofold: a sharp reduction in geopolitical risk premiums for Western energy interests and a projected expansion of refining margins. As the U.S. military establishes an administrative transition in Venezuela, the energy sector is bracing for a transition from ""scarcity mode"" to ""reconstruction mode."" Analysts believe the sudden regime change will allow complex refineries in Texas and Louisiana to finally operate at their optimal economic configuration, displacing more expensive imports from the Middle East and Canada with nearby Venezuelan grades.

A Weekend of Decisive Action: The Fall of the Maduro Regime

The catalyst for this market frenzy was a rapid-response military operation that unfolded over the weekend of January 3, 2026. Following a month-long naval blockade that had effectively choked off Venezuelan oil exports, U.S. special operations forces launched a multi-pronged strike across northern Venezuela. The operation culminated in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his inner circle in Caracas. By the morning of January 4, Maduro had been extradited to New York to face long-standing narco-terrorism charges, leaving a U.S.-backed interim administration in control of the nation’s vast energy infrastructure.

The timeline leading to this moment was marked by escalating tensions throughout late 2025. In December, the U.S. Coast Guard and Navy implemented a ""tight oil blockade,"" seizing tankers suspected of carrying sanctioned Venezuelan crude. This pressure campaign was designed to hit the regime’s primary revenue source while preparing the ground for direct intervention. Despite the intensity of the January 3 strikes, initial reports from the ground indicate that Venezuela’s critical oil production and refining facilities were largely spared from physical damage. The strategic intent appears to have been the preservation of these assets for immediate revitalization by American firms.

Key stakeholders, including the U.S. State Department and major energy conglomerates, have already begun discussing a ""Marshall Plan"" for Venezuelan oil. The goal is to repair a ""badly broken"" infrastructure that has seen production languish around 900,000 barrels per day (bpd). With U.S. officials now effectively overseeing the administrative transition, the market is pricing in a future where Venezuela returns to its historical status as a primary energy partner for the United States.

The Winners and Losers: Refiners Take Center Stage

Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) has emerged as the most visible winner in the wake of the intervention. As the single largest U.S. importer of Venezuelan crude prior to the conflict—accounting for approximately 37% of all U.S. imports from the country in late 2025—Valero is uniquely positioned to benefit. Its sophisticated Gulf Coast refineries are specifically engineered to process the ""sticky,"" heavy-sour grades like Merey 16 that are characteristic of Venezuelan output. With the ""fear premium"" on these barrels expected to vanish, Valero’s gross refining margins (GRMs) are projected to see a significant boost in the coming quarters.

Other major players in the refining space are also seeing substantial gains. Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: MPC) saw its shares rise by approximately 10% as markets recognized the value of its Garyville facility in Louisiana. Garyville is the largest heavy crude processor in the region and is expected to capture 20% to 30% of any increased Venezuelan flows. Similarly, Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) climbed over 6% following the news. The company’s Sweeny refinery in Texas, which recently completed a ""crude switching"" project, is now ideally situated to absorb Venezuelan feedstock as soon as the naval quarantine is officially lifted.

Conversely, the shift could create headwinds for other segments of the market. Canadian producers of Western Canadian Select (WCS) may face increased competition as Gulf Coast refiners pivot back to Venezuelan supply, which is geographically closer and often cheaper to transport. Additionally, Middle Eastern suppliers who have filled the heavy-sour vacuum in recent years may find their market share in the U.S. Gulf Coast eroding as the ""local"" Venezuelan supply chain is restored.

Wider Significance: A New Era for Global Supply Chains

The military action in Venezuela represents a major pivot in global energy policy, moving away from the era of sanctions and toward a model of direct infrastructure revitalization. This event fits into a broader trend of ""near-shoring"" energy security, where the U.S. seeks to minimize its reliance on volatile trans-oceanic supply chains. By bringing the world’s largest oil reserves back into the Western economic fold, the U.S. is effectively creating a massive buffer against OPEC+ production cuts and Middle Eastern instability.

The ripple effects will likely extend to global oil prices. While the immediate reaction saw WTI crude gap higher due to transitional uncertainty, the long-term outlook has turned decidedly bearish for crude prices but bullish for refined products. Analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest that a U.S.-controlled Venezuelan sector could add 500,000 bpd to global markets within 18 months, potentially leading to a supply glut that keeps a lid on energy inflation. This mirrors historical precedents like the post-war reconstruction of Iraqi oil fields, though the proximity and existing infrastructure of Venezuela suggest a much faster recovery timeline.

Regulatory and policy implications are also profound. The U.S. administration has signaled that it will grant special ""reconstruction licenses"" to American firms, potentially bypassing traditional bidding processes to expedite the flow of oil. This ""oil for stability"" trade-off marks a return to a more assertive U.S. energy diplomacy that prioritizes domestic refining economics and regional hegemony over multilateral sanctions regimes.

Looking Ahead: The Road to 2.5 Million Barrels

In the short term, the market will be watching for the official lifting of the naval blockade and the first ""clean"" shipments of Venezuelan crude to arrive at PADD 3 refineries. While the military phase of Operation Absolute Resolve was swift, the logistical challenge of repairing decades of neglect in the Orinoco Belt remains. Strategic pivots will be required from companies like Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which already has a footprint in the country, as they transition from limited operations to full-scale field development.

Over the long term, the goal is to return Venezuela to its historical production levels of 2.5 million bpd. This will require an estimated $100 billion in investment over the next decade. For refiners like Valero and Marathon, this represents a multi-year runway of high-margin feedstock. However, challenges remain, including the potential for local insurgency or political instability during the transition. The ""market opportunity"" is clear, but the ""execution risk"" of rebuilding a failed state’s primary industry cannot be ignored.

Potential scenarios range from a rapid, ""Texas-led"" oil boom in Venezuela to a more protracted and difficult stabilization period. If the transition holds, the U.S. refining sector could enter a ""golden age"" of profitability, characterized by low feedstock costs and high global demand for diesel and jet fuel.

Conclusion: A Structural Reset for the Energy Sector

The events of early January 2026 mark a turning point in the history of the energy market. The capture of the Maduro regime and the launch of a U.S.-led administrative transition have fundamentally altered the competitive landscape for oil refiners. The key takeaway for investors is the massive ""margin expansion"" potential for complex refiners like Valero, Marathon, and Phillips 66. These companies have spent years optimizing for a feedstock that was largely out of reach; now, that feedstock is poised to return in abundance.

Moving forward, the market will transition from watching military headlines to monitoring infrastructure reports. The speed at which Venezuelan production can scale will dictate the pace of refining profit growth. Investors should keep a close eye on capital expenditure announcements from major oil services firms and any shifts in U.S. trade policy regarding heavy crude imports. While the geopolitical landscape remains complex, the economic signal from the Gulf Coast is clear: the energy refining sector is entering a new era of dominance.

The fund, which was created by Congress during the Biden Administration as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, has been targeted by the Trump Administration in part because of its focus on funding climate justice programs and projects in underserved communities.

According to how the program was structured by Congress, 70% of the funds were supposed to go to low-income and otherwise disadvantaged communities. In September, a ruling was made in favor of the Trump Administration’s effort to can the program and reclaim $17 billion in unspent funds — but now an emergency appeal from the plaintiffs has been granted and the case will be heard in late February in front of a full panel of judges on the D.C. circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.

When that hearing takes place, it’ll be nearly a year since the saga started. On March 4, Trump’s EPA froze the funding for the so-called green bank program. Climate United, an organization which received nearly $7 billion from the fund in order to make grants to smaller community projects, sued the EPA just days later.

While there was a preliminary injunction granted against the EPA in April, a three-judge panel from the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 in September to have the lawsuit thrown out entirely. If that ruling stood, the EPA would also have been able to claw back $17 billion in unspent funds from Climate United and other organizations that received money from the program. The two judges who ruled in the EPA’s favor were both Trump appointees.

That the 2-1 ruling has now been vacated, however, which means that the lawsuit won’t be bumped into federal claims court, as the majority on that panel had suggested. The majority opinion in that ruling framed this as a small-bore issue, with Judge Neomi Rao writing, “claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual,” undercutting the argument that Trump’s EPA undermined the will of Congress by freezing the congressionally appropriated funds.

“Everyone deserves access to financing for clean energy projects that create good jobs, reduce pollution, and lower energy bills,” Beth Bafford, the CEO of Climate United, said in a statement. “For over nine months, EPA’s unlawful actions have prevented us from delivering clean, affordable energy to hardworking Americans across the country. We will continue to press forward on behalf of the communities we serve, and we look forward to the judges’ reconsideration of our case so we can get back to work.”

The $17 billion that remains in legal limbo will continue to be frozen while the case continues to work its way through the court.",https://wordinblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pexels-markusspiske-2990617-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:59:22.382704

Steel behemoths, nearly 600 feet tall, rose from the thousands of acres. Each of the 45 wind turbines in Apex Clean Energy’s Timbermill wind farm sits on an acre plot leased from a local landowner.

The turbines hum quietly as they spin, each revolution generating enough energy to power the average American home for four hours.

Apex Clean Energy’s Brian O’Shea and Timbermill Wind site manager Tyler Finley greeted a busload of sixth graders from Chowan County Middle School. It’s late December and the last day of classes before winter break. The kids came to tour the wind farm and learn more about the economic opportunities that hosting a wind farm provides in their home county.

“We really want them to understand what’s going on in their community — to see that there’s jobs here,” math teacher Laura Tarnaski said. “They can stay in Chowan County and have a good job.”

The children looked up to Timbermill’s flagship turbine, Penelope — named after the local Revolutionary War activist Penelope Barker. The windmill is so tall that if you stood atop Charlotte’s Wells Fargo Center, you could high-five the top of the blade as it passed its highest point.

“It’s a 4.2-megawatt wind turbine, and it generates enough power each year to power about 1,000 homes,” O’Shea said.

But Penelope — and her 44 sister turbines — do a lot more for Chowan County than just keeping the lights on.

“How much is taxes on it?” a student asked.

The company paid $3 million in taxes this year, but the county returned most of that money in economic development grants. Ultimately, Timbermill Wind produced $750,000 in revenue for the county.

“It's an economic driver as far as the tax is concerned, for sure,” County Commissioner Bob Kirby said. “They're the largest taxpayer in the county by far.”

The students were impressed by the turbines' size and cost. The developers spent about $7 million to build each one.

But Tarnaski said the field trip was about more than learning about clean energy. Chowan County is a small county with about 14,000 residents.

“We have so much of our youth, they’re going to other places for jobs,” Tarnaski said. “We want them to see the opportunities that we have in this county.”

The Timbermill wind farm only employs 8 full-time staff members, but the turbines also benefit the farmers who lease their land and air rights to the company.

Back at school, the sixth graders apply what they learned at the wind farm. Jase Goodwin and Parker Nixon blow on miniature plastic fan blades. The blades spun, and a red light on the back of the motor lit up.

Nixon says this wasn’t his first time near the turbines.

“One day I was deer hunting right beside one, and all you heard was 'woo, woo, woo',” Nixon said, imitating the whoosh of the blades as they spun.

Pedagogically, the trip was a success — in more ways than one. Goodwin said the windmill technicians had piqued his interest.

“It seems like a pretty good job, going up there, working on the stuff,” Goodwin said.

Empowering Small Communities: “Small Town Big Trees”

Leading the announcement is the launch of the Small Town Big Trees grant, a new initiative specifically designed to lower barriers for Indiana’s smaller populations. Reserved exclusively for communities with 10,000 residents or fewer, the program saw three first-time participants receive funding for tree planting in its inaugural round:

Rising Sun

Charlestown

Wakarusa

Combating the Emerald Ash Borer

The State Urban Forest Resilience (SUFR) Grant returned this year to provide critical support for areas devastated by the Emerald Ash Borer. These funds are dedicated to the treatment or removal of infested ash trees and the subsequent replanting of resilient species. The 2024 recipients include:

City of Bloomington

Indiana University (Multiple campuses)

Regreening Greenfield

Investing in the Future: CUFA Grants

The traditional Community & Urban Forestry Assistance (CUFA) Grant remains the backbone of the program, awarding funds to 15 diverse organizations. These grants support a wide array of projects, from “foraging forests” and urban orchards to workforce development and invasive species removal.

Newark City Council President Larry Crump introduced the Ports for People: Newark Fossil Free Future Ordinance, a critical policy that will protect public health, clean air and the long-term well-being of frontline communities. Newark is a vital economic hub with major port and industrial activity, but these same operations are also a significant source of harmful pollution that threatens residents’ health, environment and future.

Right now, fossil fuel facilities are releasing cancer-causing air toxics and particulate matter into the air. These emissions contribute to high rates of asthma, heart disease and other serious illnesses, disproportionately impacting low-income, Black and Brown communities. Cities worldwide are transitioning off fossil fuels and Newark has shown leadership towards a cleaner future.

“We applaud Newark’s first steps to tackle port and shipping pollution. Newark has an opportunity to end major fossil fuel expansion and prioritize the health and future of frontline communities,” said Altorice Frazier, port campaigner, Northeast at Pacific Environment. “We thank President Crump for introducing this and urge the city council to adopt this important policy.”

Fossil fuel pollution is harming Newark

Newark residents experience elevated levels of asthma and respiratory illness. These pollutants can affect the lungs, immune, nervous and reproductive systems, as well as major organs like the heart, liver and kidneys. While the 80% rate or a combined hazard quotient of 0.8 is below the official risk threshold (1.0), it is still high compared to other areas in New Jersey, putting the Newark community closer to potential harm that could be pushed over the limit if more pollution is added.

“This ordinance is not just about zoning codes or finance rules. It’s about protecting the health of Newark residents,” said Dr. Leah Owens, ports and policy analyst at South Ward Environmental Alliance. “Fine particles called particulate matter enter the bloodstream, causing systemic inflammation in vital organs. This is how pollution becomes disease, and how zoning decisions become life-or-death issues for our community.”

Expanding fossil fuel infrastructure locks the community into decades of pollution and carbon emissions, worsening the climate crisis. These burdens fall disproportionately on Black, Brown and low-income neighborhoods. Over the past four years, Newark residents have organized, litigated, and mobilized to stop a proposal by the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission to build a fourth gas-fired power plant in the Ironbound. Designated as an overburdened community under New Jersey’s Environmental Justice Law, the Ironbound already faces disproportionate pollution, truly underscoring why Newark must prevent further fossil fuel expansion and protect its most vulnerable communities.

“For decades, the Ironbound community has been forced to shoulder the health and environmental costs of fossil fuel infrastructure they did not choose,” said Alejandra Torres, assistant director of organizing and advocacy at the Ironbound Community Corporation. “This ordinance is a critical step toward stopping further fossil fuel expansion, honoring New Jersey’s Environmental Justice Law, and ensuring that Newark’s frontline communities can breathe clean air and thrive.”

“This ordinance is about protecting families and putting children’s health first in Newark. Parents have been clear for years that pollution is affecting our neighborhoods and our kids,” said Erica Beverett, lead organizer, Parents Engaging Parents. “This policy is an important step toward clean air and a healthier future.”

“New Jersey has made a lot of promises via executive orders about reducing greenhouse gases and reaching 100% clean energy by 2035, but we’ve still got a long way to go to make these goals a reality. The Newark Fossil Free Future ordinance is a concrete step in that direction, as it would prevent further buildout of fossil fuel infrastructure in Newark, helping the State move away from reliance on fossil fuels and into a cleaner future,” said Casandia Bellevue, Senior Associate Attorney, Earthjustice Community Partnerships Program.

Ports for People: Newark Fossil Free Future Ordinance

The ordinance, if passed, will:

Stop public funding for polluting infrastructure and prevent taxpayer dollars from being used for new or expanded fossil fuel facilities

Halt fossil fuel expansion of major sources of air pollution by amending land-use codes to prohibit new or expanded fossil fuel facilities within city limits

Advance environmental justice by reducing pollution burdens in frontline communities and improving long-term health outcomes

Benefits: A clean, healthy future for Newark

Passing this ordinance will:

Protect public health by preventing toxic emissions from future fossil fuel facilities

Improve air quality for residents

Support the transition to zero-emission infrastructure and create opportunities for clean energy jobs

Why clean ports are needed

About 31 million people in the U.S. live within three miles of a port. These are predominantly frontline and fenceline communities that already face disproportionate pollution burdens. Ships burn heavy fuel oil, the dirtiest fuel on Earth. The result is toxic air filled with carcinogens, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. People living near ports are exposed to pollution that increases asthma, heart disease, and premature mortality. Globally, shipping emissions were projected to cause 265,000 premature deaths in 2020.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ironbound_aristide-economopoulos.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 15:59:54.212988

What once looked like an experimental climate solution now stands at the center of global decarbonization strategies. By 2026, governments, corporations, and investors increasingly rely on carbon capture to deal with emissions that cannot be eliminated.

Three companies now dominate this space: Climeworks, Carbon Engineering, and SLB Capturi. Each addresses a different part of the problem. Some remove carbon dioxide directly from the air. Others stop emissions at factories before they escape. Together, they shape how the world manages residual emissions in a tightening net-zero era.

Market Overview: Why Carbon Capture Matters Now

BCC Research highlighted that the global market for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies was at $3.4 billion in 2024. It is projected to reach $9.6 billion by the end of 2029, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1% during the forecast period of 2024 to 2029.

Governments expanded incentives, while companies faced growing pressure to meet climate commitments with real, measurable outcomes.

In the United States, tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act made large-scale capture projects financially attractive. In Europe, the expanded EU Emissions Trading System increased compliance costs, pushing industries toward capture solutions. Meanwhile, corporate buyers signed long-term contracts to secure high-quality carbon removal credits.

At the same time, technology advanced quickly. Capture costs fell, monitoring systems improved, and long-term storage options expanded. Leading projects now capture carbon for less than $300 per ton, a sharp drop from early pilot costs.

By 2026, more than 20 direct air capture facilities operate worldwide. Still, most captured carbon comes from point-source projects in cement, steel, waste-to-energy, and hydrogen production. Permanence, transparency, and verification now define success in the carbon market.

Climeworks: From DAC Pioneer to Carbon Removal Platform

Climeworks remains the most visible name in direct air capture. Based in Switzerland, the company developed modular systems that pull carbon dioxide directly from the air using fans and solid filters.

Its Iceland operations set early benchmarks. The Orca plant captures 4,000 tons of CO₂ per year. The newer Mammoth facility scales capacity to 36,000 tons annually. Generation 3 technology sharply cuts energy use, making DAC more efficient and easier to expand.

However, it has evolved beyond hardware alone.

Building Diversified Carbon Removal Portfolios

Climeworks now offers blended carbon removal portfolios designed for corporate buyers. These portfolios combine direct air capture with other engineered and nature-based removal methods. The strategy spreads risk while meeting different climate and budget needs.

The portfolio includes:

Direct Air Capture with geological storage

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)

Biochar

Enhanced rock weathering (ERW)

Afforestation and reforestation

Mangrove restoration

Each method provides a different storage lifespan. DAC and BECCS store carbon for over 10,000 years. ERW lasts about 1,000 years. Biochar offers century-scale storage. Nature-based projects provide shorter-term storage but deliver strong co-benefits for ecosystems and communities.

By 2026, Climeworks will deliver over 50,000 tons of verified carbon removal credits per year. Buyers include Stripe, Schneider Electric, and shipping giant NYK. Credit prices range from $600 to $800 per ton, reflecting strong demand for durable removals.

This portfolio model positions Climeworks as a full-service carbon removal provider, especially for companies tackling Scope 3 residual emissions.

Carbon Engineering: Scaling Direct Air Capture to Megatons

Carbon Engineering takes a bold, industrial approach to carbon removal. Instead of small modular units, it builds large-scale DAC plants designed to capture hundreds of thousands of tons of CO₂ each year.

The Canada-founded company uses a liquid solvent process. Air flows through large contactors, where potassium hydroxide captures CO₂. The system regenerates the solvent in a closed loop, producing a pure CO₂ stream ready for storage or fuel production.

Occidental Petroleum acquired Carbon Engineering in 2023, accelerating its scale-up through access to capital, storage sites, and energy infrastructure.

The Stratos Project Sets a New Standard

By 2026, Carbon Engineering’s Stratos facility in Texas will capture between 500,000 and 1 million tons of CO₂ annually, making it the world’s largest DAC plant.

The company relies on proven industrial equipment and standardized designs. This “design one, build many” approach lowers costs and speeds up deployment across regions.

Capture costs now fall between $250 and $600 per ton, supported by U.S. tax credits and long-term offtake agreements with buyers like Frontier, Amazon, and Airbus.

Linking Capture to Clean Fuels

Carbon Engineering also uses captured CO₂ to produce synthetic fuels. Its Air-to-Fuels technology combines CO₂ with green hydrogen to create low-carbon aviation fuel. This helps reduce emissions in aviation, a sector responsible for about 2–3% of global emissions.

By combining storage and fuel production, Carbon Engineering bridges voluntary carbon markets with compliance systems. Its large pipeline—running into tens of millions of tons—makes it a cornerstone of future gigaton-scale removal.

SLB Capturi: Decarbonizing Heavy Industry at the Source

While DAC removes carbon after it mixes into the air, SLB Capturi focuses on prevention. The joint venture between SLB and Aker Carbon Capture specializes in point-source carbon capture for industrial emitters.

Its amine-based technology captures more than 95% of CO₂ emissions from facilities such as cement plants, waste-to-energy sites, gas processing units, and bioenergy operations.

Designed for Fast Deployment

SLB Capturi’s Just Catch™ units are modular and compact. Operators can retrofit them into existing plants with minimal downtime. This makes them ideal for industries under immediate pressure to cut Scope 1 emissions.

Ørsted Kalundborg CO₂ Hub

By 2026, the company can support over 5 million tons of annual capture capacity across Europe and North America. Many projects connect directly to permanent storage sites, including offshore saline aquifers.

Role in Carbon Markets

BECCS projects using SLB Capturi technology qualify as durable carbon removals. These credits typically trade between $80 and $150 per ton, making them more affordable than DAC while still meeting high integrity standards.

SLB’s strength lies in integration. The company combines capture, transport, and storage into a single value chain. This end-to-end capability appeals to oil majors, utilities, and governments seeking reliable decarbonization pathways.

What This Means for Carbon Capture in 2026

Together, Climeworks, Carbon Engineering, and SLB Capturi define the carbon capture landscape in 2026. The market now rewards permanence, transparency, and verified impact. Buyers no longer chase cheap offsets. They invest in long-term solutions that stand up to scrutiny.

As net-zero deadlines draw closer, carbon capture shifts from optional to essential.

As with the August pause, thousands of workers on the Revolution Wind project are now without a job.","PROVIDENCE — It was three days before the holiday when President Donald Trump announced Rhode Island, figuratively, would be getting coal for Christmas.

Citing national security concerns, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced Dec. 22 a last-minute stop-work order for all utility-scale offshore wind projects on the Eastern Seaboard. Impacted projects include Revolution Wind, Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.

It was the second time in less than six months the Trump administration had attempted to halt the expansion of offshore wind. The administration’s previous stop-work order, issued last August, was ultimately overturned by the courts pending a lawsuit by attorneys from the Revolution Wind project.

Rhode Island’s state officials say they aren’t pleased with the surprise stop-work orders from the administration.

“This is BS, that’s all this is,” said Gov. Dan McKee at a Jan. 2 press conference. “This will impact Rhode Island and the greater region.”

“I called the deputy secretary of defense and asked him, ‘What is the national security reason behind the order,’ and his response, like every other time I’ve asked, was ‘It’s classified,’ which means they don’t have a reason,” Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he was halting negotiations with Senate Republicans over federal permitting reform laws. Whitehouse had been part of a group supporting the SPEED Act, which would have updated permitting and environmental requirements energy developers must follow when constructing oil or natural gas pipelines, renewable energy arrays, and transmission lines.

“We’ve paused negotiations until the attack on clean energy ends, and we can have assurances that a solid, bipartisan bill would actually get implemented fairly by this administration,” Whitehouse said. “I can’t possibly trust any fairness from this administration. It would be fossil fuel corruption all the way through.”

Friday’s press conference was one-half of a two-part event designed to raise awareness about the Trump administration’s hostility to Rhode Island’s nascent offshore wind projects, with the other half of the event being a rally outside at 195 District Park. The event was organized by Climate Action Rhode Island, Climate Jobs RI, Green Energy Consumers Alliance, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, and the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council.

Meanwhile, Revolution Wind announced on Jan. 1 it had already filed a supplemental complaint in U.S. District Court over the new stop-work order, asking for another preliminary injunction. In its statement, the company said it was still seeking to work constructively with the Trump administration toward a resolution, and that “the lease suspension order violates applicable law.”

At the time of the stop-work order, the company was weeks away from generating power. The project is over 85% complete, having installed 58 out of 65 offshore foundations and wind turbines. Both offshore substations are already constructed, and the export cable has been completely installed, according to the company.

The Revolution Wind project has been some 20 years in the making. Ever since the Block Island Wind Farm, completed in 2016, showed proof-of-concept for offshore wind, Rhode Island has been pursuing wind projects as an energy goal.

The project, once completed, is expected to provide the electrical grid with enough power for 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. This wind farm alone has supported 1,000 union jobs, contributing 2 million work hours to the project, with a supply chain extending to 40 different states.

As with the August pause, thousands of workers on the Revolution Wind project are now without a job. Rhode Island native and union painter Nick Reynolds said he spent a large amount of time and energy getting the training and certifications necessary to work on offshore wind projects.

“I had a great job in a promising new industry with a lot of potential for future growth,” Reynolds said. “Now I’m searching for construction work in the dead of winter with 12,000 other human beings.”

On Sept 22, a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s first stop-work order against Revolution Wind. Ørsted, one of the companies behind the offshore wind project, said it was losing $2 million a day during the month-long pause from the first stop-work order.

The project is going to be vital if Rhode Island hopes to meet the mandates of the Act on Climate, the law that requires the state to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and other environmental laws. The state’s renewable energy standard requires the state to source its electricity entirely from renewable sources within the next seven years, and future offshore wind projects like Revolution Wind were expected to play a large part in that.

The stop-work order is coming at a time when energy prices are still sky-high, and many Rhode Islanders are feeling the pinch of a higher cost of living than just a few years ago, with no additional energy generation coming even from existing natural gas or other sources.

“It is entirely an administration that refuses to faithfully execute the laws, and they’re doing that with the motive to take money from Rhode Island ratepayers pockets and shovel it up to the fossil fuel units that wouldn’t otherwise be running,” Whitehouse said.",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wind-rally.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 13:58:27.017261

DOE could also leverage Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41) to expedite permitting processes for carbon capture and carbon dioxide pipeline projects.","A second coal-focused notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), “Improving Efficiency, Reliability, and Flexibility of Coal-Based Power Plants,” misallocates carbon capture funding to keep America’s aging coal fleet online. Like the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning And Modernization” funding opportunity announcement, this NOFO would divert funding away from carbon capture innovation programs authorized by Congress in the Energy Act of 2020 during the first Trump administration. Instead, DOE proposes to use this $100 million to refurbish and extend the operation of aging coal plants. DOE now has a timely opportunity to align future funding decisions with energy production and carbon utilization objectives through the new Office of Hydrocarbon and Geothermal Energy (HGEO). Furthermore, DOE has clear statutory authority to advance carbon utilization programs in ways that support domestic energy production, reliability, and emissions reduction, an approach that Clean Air Task Force (CATF) supports.

CATF has closely tracked the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) over the past four years and offers the following analysis and recommendations to help ensure these authorities are applied as Congress intended and deliver measurable deployment.

Why this FOA misses the mark

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is clear. Bipartisan congressional majorities directed DOE to establish a carbon capture technology program focused on the development and demonstration of transformational carbon capture technologies that significantly improve emissions reductions and environmental performance at coal and natural gas facilities. It explicitly requires that this program include large-scale pilot projects and demonstration projects for carbon capture technologies, as well as front-end engineering.

The statute provides that:

The Secretary shall establish a carbon capture technology program for the development of transformational technologies that will significantly improve the efficiency, effectiveness, costs, emissions reductions, and environmental performance of coal and natural gas use, including in manufacturing and industrial facilities.

The new funding opportunity does not support the purpose of the program: to improve carbon capture technology. DOE elevates two statutory program considerations —water and fuel use—and disregards the primary requirement from Congress to fund carbon capture technologies. Furthermore, wastewater treatment upgrades and dual-firing retrofits are not “transformational;” they are commercially mature and widely deployed operational practices used for regulatory compliance and fuel flexibility.

Deploying carbon capture to support domestic energy production using DOE authorities

While the current NOFO misses the mark, DOE has broader statutory authorities that can be used to deploy carbon capture in ways that directly support domestic energy production and emissions reduction. As the newly formed HGEO has indicated, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a priority area for R&D and deployment, creating a clear opportunity to design carbon capture programs that align with both industry capabilities and DOE’s energy production objectives.

EOR using CO₂ injection permanently sequesters CO₂ through well-understood permanent geologic storage processes (structural, residual, solubility, and mineral trapping), resulting in a net lifecycle emissions reduction of approximately 37% per barrel, while extending the productivity of existing assets.

Recent federal policy changes make this focus timely for HGEO. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 updated Section 45Q by retaining the $85-per-ton tax credit for carbon dioxide that is permanently stored and increasing the credit for carbon dioxide used in enhanced oil recovery to the same $85-per-ton level, up from $60 per ton under prior law. By maintaining the 45Q incentive and establishing parity in utilization, the legislation makes this a particularly timely opportunity to advance the deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage.

For CO₂-EOR to scale, however, significantly greater volumes of captured CO₂ will be required, particularly in states such as Wyoming and North Dakota where oil field productivity is declining, and where there is unmet injection demand for captured CO₂. Notably, oil and gas production remains a major source of state government revenue in both Wyoming and North Dakota, highlighting how well-designed federal carbon capture policies and programs that expand reliable CO₂ supply can simultaneously support domestic energy production, state fiscal stability, and emissions reductions.

Recommendations to DOE

DOE should advance carbon capture, utilization, and storage by addressing midstream infrastructure and capital barriers using existing authorities under both HGEO and DOE’s newly renamed Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF):

The Office of Energy Dominance Financing can drive the build-out of shared carbon dioxide pipelines, essential for scaling both enhanced oil recovery and geologic storage. Under the previous administration, the $2.1 billion Carbon Dioxide Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation (CIFIA) program was unable to support a single project amid industry concerns about slow and uncertain federal financing and permitting processes. IIJA made CIFIA appropriations available until expended, so aside from those funds that Congress chooses to transfer to another purpose, the $2.1 billion in CIFIA appropriations remain available to DOE’s new Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), under the “Clean Coal, Oil and Gas & Hydrocarbons EDF tech sector.” Congress should not seek to transfer CIFIA funds to other programs, given the potential benefits to energy production and technological innovation that will accrue to U.S. taxpayers and the private sector from deploying these funds consistent with IIJA direction.

Prioritize speed of deployment and leverage “Other Transaction Authority” for CO₂ pipelines. In addition to potentially leveraging EDF’s new focus on speed of execution, HGEO could consider utilizing DOE’s Other Transaction Authority (OTA). OTA can streamline government contracting processes to tailor agreements and fast-track funding for critical projects. For example, in certain regions, modeled networks of carbon dioxide pipelines can be optimized to utilize existing rights-of-way for as much as half of the buildout, which would significantly ease the financial and regulatory barriers to infrastructure development.

Ensure funding opportunities have robust application pools by directly meeting industry needs and timelines before issuing a funding notice. Host convenings in key basins with industry and academia in Q1 2026 to identify necessary streamlining reforms and program design improvements to better design a funding notice that can meet industry needs for deploying carbon dioxide transport infrastructure. Convening design and focus can be informed by stakeholder comments on DOE’s interim final rule, “Energy Dominance Financing Amendments,” which amends DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the EDF provisions of OBBA. DOE could also leverage Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41) to expedite permitting processes for carbon capture and carbon dioxide pipeline projects. Projects receiving FAST-41 permitting assistance benefit from the Permitting Council’s interagency coordination services and receive focused attention from deputy secretary-level senior leaders from all involved federal agencies, ensuring projects avoid bureaucratic delays.

Conclusion

Taken together, these recommendations illustrate how DOE can use its existing authorities, expertise, and convening power to advance carbon capture, utilization, and storage in ways that respond to industry needs, address infrastructure and water constraints, and support the department’s broader objectives around energy production and reliability. By prioritizing program designs and implementation pathways that enable scalable deployment across the CCUS value chain, and by clearly communicating timelines, engaging early with project developers, and convening industry, state regulators, and academic experts in key basins such as the Bakken and the Permian, DOE can help unlock private capital for CO₂ transport and storage while ensuring federal resources are positioned to deliver energy security.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/25150917/us-power-plant-scaled-e1706213432842.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:59:19.442151

Just how pricey remains to be seen. New financing models could help keep some solar and battery costs in check, according to Emily Walker, director of insights at online solar marketplace EnergySage.

Here’s what you need to know.

The tax credit repeal’s impact on prices

The expiration of the 30% federal tax credit for solar and battery installations at the end of 2025 doesn’t necessarily make the equipment more costly to buy but for homeowners with a tax liability, it does end the ability to reduce or erase their tax bill. A typical solar and battery system generated tax credits worth about $10,000.

You can still save by leasing

Tax credits remain for leased solar systems through the end of 2027, though the installer receives the incentive and passes on the savings to homeowners through lower monthly payments or other cost reductions.

A new model of solar ownership is emerging

Walker said installers who sold systems are now switching to a new model that lets residents ultimately own their solar and battery arrays while securing the savings from leasing. Called lease-to-own or a prepaid lease, a homeowner pays for the cost of the system upfront and the installer passes on the tax credit benefits as a discount. The solar company must retain ownership for a certain number of years under the tax code but then transfers title to the homeowner.

Southern California installer SolarShoppers sells its systems but company president Shawn Heckerman said he estimates that prepaid leases will account for nearly all of his business in 2026. Like other solar installers, he anticipates that demand will initially soften but recover later in the year. “I expect us to have a better year in 2026 than the last one, even with the tax credit expiring,” he said.

That’s due to soaring electricity rates and temperatures that force residents to run their air conditioners. “When we get into the summer, customer calls spike when they get their first high utility bill,” said Heckerman.

Walker also expects homeowners to continue adding panels as they install electric vehicle chargers and replace fossil fuel appliances with induction stoves and heat pumps. That can make going solar still financially attractive in the long run, even if the absence of federal incentives means adding a couple of years to the time it takes for the energy savings to equal the cost of the system, she said.

“When you’re talking about something that’s producing electricity for 25 years, it’s really just a blip,” said Walker.

New rules could raise the cost of solar panels and batteries

To receive the tax credit, leased systems must comply with new domestic manufacturing requirements that took effect Jan. 1, 2026. The federal government, though, has yet to issue final guidance on what percentage of components from China and other countries are prohibited under the Trump tax bill enacted in July.

Tariffs will also add costs

The U.S. imports most of its solar panels from China, Vietnam and other countries subject to tariffs. Nearly all batteries for residential energy storage are made in China.

Tariffs and manufacturing mandates will likely push up prices, according to analysts, but Walker said that will encourage the industry to focus on cutting “soft costs” like permitting and paperwork that result in U.S. residents paying significantly more for solar energy than those in Australia and Europe.

How heat pumps are affected

Homeowners have also lost the $2,000 federal tax credit for heat pumps that can warm and cool dwellings and provide hot water. But Francis Dietz, a spokesperson for industry group AHRI, noted that most heat pumps didn’t qualify for the incentive, which was only for the most efficient and expensive models.

“You can still get your basic or basic-plus heat pump and don’t have to worry about the tax credit going away, so it won’t make a big difference for the average consumer,” he said.

The US imported 382,000 heat pumps, mainly from China and Mexico, out of 4.1 million of the devices that shipped in 2024, according to AHRI and the United Nations. But prices may rise modestly as domestically assembled heat pumps use Chinese components subject to tariffs.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc225e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+133/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F79%2F5a678a1a54a70119c1750b221b11%2F1586635-fi-1104-solar5-ac.JPG,N,,2026-01-05 12:58:22.087697

Gray said Rhode Island is litigating the case, but for now has started working with auto dealers in Rhode Island directly to come up with a replacement approach.","PROVIDENCE — When state environmental officials dug into working on the state’s climate roadmap in 2024, they were feeling pretty optimistic about Rhode Island’s climate goals, for good reason.

The Biden administration was dolling out billions and billions in federal dollars, via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) for environmental and other sustainable projects they had never done before, and the previous year’s greenhouse gas emissions inventory revealed Rhode Island cleared its 2020 carbon reduction goal without breaking a sweat.

But in the 12 months since state officials began work on Rhode Island’s 2025 climate action strategy, the world looks much different. Since the second Trump administration took power last year, the federal government has rescinded or withdrawn much of the money it was handing out to Rhode Island’s government, nonprofits, and other entities, and rolled back many environmental protections or powers given to the states.

“The whole federal landscape has changed 180 degrees since the Trump administration,” said Terry Gray, director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and chair of the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4), the state’s lead agency on climate response. “It’s creating huge challenges at the state level. Housing, environment, energy, food, everything that the states do not have the resources to fill in the gaps created by the federal government.

“We’re working with a coalition of other states that are all in the same boat, and we’re looking at different alternatives, different ways to still move forward and meet our climate goals.”

The hostile new federal administration, as well as the region’s persistently high energy costs, temper much of the 142-page climate action document released by the EC4 last year. The plan was part of a mandate from the Act on Climate law: lower the state’s carbon emissions and provide scenarios of how the state can do it.

But transitioning away from fossil fuels — adopting electric vehicles, switching to heat pumps and renewable sources for electricity — come at growing cost for Rhode Islanders, especially without the kind of federal incentives environment agencies got used to under former President Biden.

While utility costs have slightly declined since their 2022 high, the year state regulators approved a 47% rate hike from Rhode Island Energy, energy prices have not come down to pre-2022 levels. The average utility bill using 500 kilowatt-hours in 2017 cost around $100 a month. In 2025, that same utility bill will exceed $150.

“Customers are going to have to be comfortable with transitioning everything to electricity, and that prices are stable, and that they’re affordable or they’re not going to [accept] heat pumps or EVs or anything else,” Gray said.

The state’s new strategy primarily lays out two different scenarios. The first is one where Rhode Island continues the current programs it has to spur EV adoption, heat pumps, and other carbon-neutral technology to homes and businesses.

If everything remains the same, Rhode Island’s emissions will continue to go down, that’s the good news, but not fast enough to meet the net-zero by 2050 mandates required by the Act on Climate law. By 2050 under the current policy scenario, Rhode Island will only succeed at reducing its emissions 71% below the 1990 base levels used to measure greenhouse gas reductions.

That amount is enough to get Rhode Island to meet its 2030 benchmark goals, but none of the other benchmark targets in the Act on Climate.

“If you look at the programs we put in place in Rhode Island from 2021 to 2024, we were clearly on a path that would have resulted in us meeting the mandate we need to by the end of this decade,” Gray said. “All the pieces are there.”

The second scenario lays out a pathway to reduce emissions to net-zero by 2050, and it’s a steep climb. Carbon fuels are deeply embedded into the state’s economy, as reflected in the annual greenhouse gas emissions inventories produced by DEM. Electricity is mostly squared away via the state’s renewable energy standard, which mandates by 2033 100% of electricity sold in the state must come from renewable sources.

Transportation and buildings account for two-thirds of all emissions. Transportation emissions account for 37% of all greenhouse gas emissions produced in Rhode Island, according to DEM’s latest greenhouse gas inventory released in November. Residential, commercial, and industrial buildings account for another 32.6%.

For transportation, that means personal vehicles. Rhode Island would have to register 13,000 new passenger EVs this year alone, a tall task given that the federal government is ending the tax incentives for purchasing an EV.

In 2027, the state would have to register another 23,000 EVs to keep on track for its net-zero climate goals. In 2028, the number will increase to 27,000. By 2030 the state needs to be registering 36,000 new EVs to meet the goals of the Act on Climate, at a time when most basic EVs start out at much higher prices than gasoline-powered cars.

“The cost of an electric vehicle is higher than the cost of an internal combustion vehicle,” Gray said. “There’s a differential there that has to be absorbed by the customer. Some of that could be offset by tax credits or incentives, but there’s still a cost differential there.”

EVs, in particular, are going to be tricky. DEM passed new regulatory rules, Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks, in 2024, phasing out sales of new gas-powered cars starting in 2035. Rhode Island piggybacked off California, a state that for decades has had a special waiver from the federal government to have its own, stricter emission standards for cars.

But Congress last year voted to rescind California’s, and by extension, Rhode Island’s and other states’ stricter emission standards. Gray said Rhode Island is litigating the case, but for now has started working with auto dealers in Rhode Island directly to come up with a replacement approach.

Exponential heat pump installations and sales is another area in which the state will have to break records annually to meet the Act on Climate mandates. Last year the state sold 3,064 heat pumps, according to data from the Clean Heat Rhode Island program, which provides financial incentives to homeowners and businesses to install heat pumps in buildings.

This year, the state will have to see at least 5,600 heat pump sales. Next year it will have to increase to 8,900, and that number will have to double by 2030, to 15,000 heat pump sales a year to meet the Act on Climate mandates.

The plan identifies more than two dozen recommendations and next steps the state government can take in the years ahead. The actions include continued investments into energy efficiency programs, heat pump incentives, and codifying Gov. Dan McKee’s executive order on leading by example for state agencies.

Gray said the EC4 will be busy in the coming months and years to implement the plan. The agency is currently close to finalizing its coastal resilience plan, as mandated by the Act on Coasts, and expects to move that up for a vote in February after a public comment period this month. After that, said Gray, he wants to hone in on the public comments received on the climate action strategy, focusing on some of the policy ideas and implementation areas.

As DEM director, Gray said he wants the department to start working toward some of the lead-by-example actions taken by other agencies, installing LED lighting, performing energy audits, and the weatherization of office buildings around the state.

And there’s always a new climate action strategy to look forward to, as it’s required to be updated every five years, with progress reports due annually.

“We’re not going to be sitting back and coasting off the plan for five years,” Gray said. “There’s a lot we want to get done.”",https://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CCSign.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 12:58:26.703873

More than a cost, battery recycling represents an opportunity.
In China, a vast network of informal collection and dismantling workshops means that much battery recycling operates outside the regulatory framework.","While electric cars are multiplying on Brazilian streets, the fate of their depleted batteries remains uncertain, raising concerns about possible soil and water contamination and the risk of accidents, such as fires, in the event of improper disposal.

End-of-life regulations for these batteries are still in their infancy in Brazil, even though the number of electric vehicles on the country’s streets surged past 500,000 (including hybrids) during 2025.

At the same time, Chinese automakers – the protagonists of this expansion – did not provide detail on their plans for the sector in Brazil to Dialogue Earth. These brands already operate structured recycling processes in China.

Since 2016, China has been consolidating a regulatory framework for the recycling of electric vehicle batteries. Despite obstacles in the enforcement of the rules, China’s recycling rate for these batteries rose from 25% in 2020 to 40% in 2023, according to its Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). A 2024 analysis attributed the progress to regulations that make automakers responsible for collection and reuse, supported by tax incentives and a digital tracking system.

“The systematisation of the closed cycle and digital traceability strengthen manufacturers’ responsibility, helping to prevent batteries from becoming environmental liabilities in China,” says Hudson Zanin, a researcher who conducts tests on batteries at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) in São Paulo.

In May this year, more than a decade after the arrival of the first electric vehicles in Brazil, its senate presented a bill to create the National Policy on Battery Circularity. The proposal establishes a “battery passport” with data on composition, origin and reuse possibilities, in line with the system being implemented in the European Union.

The text is under review by the Brazilian senate’s environment committee, which is one of the first stages of the process. A date is yet to be set for its entry into force.

Marcelo Cairolli, infrastructure director of the Brazilian Electric Vehicle Association (ABVE), considers the policy “a good initiative to prevent pollution”. But Cairolli notes that the bill still needs adjustments so as not to conflict with rules already applied by environmental agencies to the disposal of hazardous or polluting equipment – even if they are not specific to batteries.

Lack of transparency

The embryonic regulation contrasts with the rapid adoption of electric cars in Brazil. Chinese automakers are rushing to make the country the hub of the sector in Latin America.

In June, the Chinese manufacturer BYD announced production had commenced at its factory in the north-eastern state of Bahia, with an initial annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles. The company leads the domestic market, being behind a third of electric vehicle sales and more than 180,000 units sold since 2022, according to the ABVE.

Recommended

BYD, which has been selling passenger cars in Brazil since 2021, offers an eight-year warranty on its batteries. This means that many of them will begin to reach the end of their useful life in the coming years, increasing the urgency for reuse or recycling solutions.

Dialogue Earth made several attempts to contact BYD to find out what practices it adopts or intends to adopt with end-of-life batteries, but received no response.

BYD’s approach thus far in Brazil differs from its progress in China, where it has been rapidly expanding its presence in battery recycling. In 2024, it created Xixian New District BYD Industrial Co, focused on battery manufacturing and recycling, and established partnerships with companies in the sector. According to China’s MIIT, BYD maintains more than 50 collection and recycling points in the country.

Other Chinese automakers selling in Brazil also have limited available recycling information, or adopt limited practices. Great Wall Motor (GWM) and Geely Brasil did not respond to requests for comment, while JAC Motors told Dialogue Earth it does not have a reverse logistics policy, although it maintains a laboratory to replace defective battery cells.

Volvo Cars, a subsidiary of China’s Geely, said in a statement that it “already collects batteries at the end of their useful life” in Brazil and that, when there is a fault that makes them unusable, “the approved supplier collects and recycles the part.” According to the company, this process reuses 95% of the material, and the remaining 5% is disposed of in accordance with Brazilian law. Volvo did not provide details on tracking, the volume of recycled batteries, or the legislation that guides the process.

In China, GWM stated in its 2024 financial report that it has been expanding battery recovery and installing dismantling workshops. On its website, it lists more than 600 authorised battery collection points.

According to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, by the end of 2021, 173 companies in the sector had opened more than 10,000 recycling workshops in China between them.

“The regulatory need in Brazil becomes even more evident when one observes this double standard,” says Zanin. “The lack of clear regulation and oversight means that circular practices are treated as an optional cost here. This difference in behaviour, although economically rational for the sector in the short term, poses a huge environmental risk for the country in the future.”

Data is lacking, but innovation exists

In Brazil, there is no available data on how many batteries have reached the end of their useful life. At the request of this report, projections shared by NeoCharge, a São Paulo-based company specialising in charging infrastructure, estimate that between 1,000 and 2,500 batteries from all-electric vehicles in Brazil are expected to reach this stage by 2030. Most of the units that are expected to reach the end of their useful life this decade belong to the first generation of electric vehicles sold in Brazil, such as the 2014 BMW i3.

According to NeoCharge’s general director, Ayrton Barros, the average eight-year warranty generally offered by automakers – influenced by legal requirements in China and market competition – does not reflect actual durability, which usually exceeds 15 years, depending on use. He excludes hybrids and plug-ins from his estimates because, according to the research he consults, drivers tend to rely more on combustion engines in these cases.

A Hong Kong environmental organisation projects that around 10 million batteries will be depleted globally by 2035.

Barros says the Brazilian recycling chain is still in its infancy because the market is new and demand is low. “The product is very new, so the processes are not yet established,” says the NeoCharge executive.

More than a cost, battery recycling represents an opportunity. For example, refining – the stages in which crushed battery material known as “black mass” is transformed into minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt – is used in the manufacture of new cells. China also leads this segment of the market: its black mass refining capacity is expected to reach almost 2.5 million tonnes by the end of this year; that should correspond to 89% of global capacity, according to an analysis by the consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

The sector is also becoming a fertile field for innovation in Brazil. Energy Source, a São Paulo-based start-up, has developed its own technologies for battery recycling and markets mineral by-products obtained in the process – such as copper – for use in other sectors, for example as agricultural fertiliser. Only two other battery recyclers, Re-Teck and Lorene, operate in the country.

David Noronha, CEO of Energy Source, believes Brazil is not at environmental risk from battery disposal because solutions for recycling, reuse, repair, refining and traceability have already been developed. “And more technologies will continue to emerge as the market grows, stimulating new businesses in the reverse chain,” he adds.

For Zanin, from Unicamp, Brazil has important advantages, such as strategic resources (including lithium, nickel and graphite) and advanced research capacities. He points out, however, that the country lacks solid traceability mechanisms and warns of the risk of irregular workshops for battery collection, as is already the case in China.

In China, a vast network of informal collection and dismantling workshops means that much battery recycling operates outside the regulatory framework. According to MIIT estimates, less than four of every 1,000 batteries reach official recyclers.

For this reason, Zanin’s team at the university is developing a platform based on blockchain and artificial intelligence to monitor the chain and prevent irregular practices.

Drivers unaware of battery cycle

In Campinas, a city where electric and hybrid cars are becoming popular, and home to one of BYD’s Brazilian factories, businessman Leandro Rocini has been swept up in the rise of electromobility.

In 2025, Rocini bought a BYD Dolphin – currently the best-selling electric car and one of the most affordable in Brazil, according to ABVE. At the dealership, he was told the battery could last about 10 years, but he received no guidance on what to do when it reaches the end of its cycle. “I hear it lasts a long time, but I don’t worry about these things,” he admits with a laugh.

Civil servant Ariadne Bonvino shares an electric GWM Ora 03 with her husband, purchased last year to drive around Brasília, where they live. The couple is also thinking about purchasing a hybrid – they want a combustion backup for trips to the countryside, where there are still few charging stations.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2026/01/BYD-battery-factory-in-Manaus-Brazil_Alamy_2WRMNA5-1-e1767624401686.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 12:58:31.704134

The package would preserve funding for health care, public safety, education, infrastructure and treaty obligations across Indian Country.

The three-bill package combines the Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development, and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bills — a so-called “minibus” funding package covering most federal programs that fund tribal governments, tribal enterprises and treaty-based obligations. The agreement reflects negotiations between House and Senate appropriators from both parties and now moves toward floor votes in both chambers, as congressional leaders work to pass full-year funding ahead of a looming government shutdown deadline.

For tribes, the agreement represents a significant reversal of the administration’s budget request, which would have sharply reduced funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, tribal public safety programs and environmental initiatives. Appropriators instead largely maintained existing funding levels, rejected proposed reductions and fully funded legally required tribal payments that support the day-to-day operation of tribal governments.

In a summary released by Democratic appropriators, the package is described as delivering essential funding to support tribes and treaty obligations, rejecting what they characterized as President Trump’s “push to slash funding” for tribal programs by nearly $1 billion.

Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the legislation would “help ensure Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.”

The Interior bill provides continued support for core tribal government services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including roads, housing improvement, natural resource management and tribal courts. It also preserves funding for tribal public safety and justice programs, including initiatives addressing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons.

One of the important outcomes for tribes is full funding for Tribal Sovereignty Payments, including contract support costs and Section 105(l) lease payments tied to self-determination and self-governance agreements. Those payments, which are required under federal law, have become increasingly important to tribal budgets following recent court rulings.

Indian Health Service funding is also preserved, including advance appropriations that provide tribes and tribal health systems greater budget certainty for staffing, hiring and service delivery, a mechanism first adopted in fiscal 2023. Construction and sanitation funding for tribal health facilities is maintained, along with operational funding for existing and newly opened clinics.

Energy and water provisions continue funding for tribal water rights settlements and infrastructure projects, while the Environmental Protection Agency accounts include support for tribal assistance grants and Alaska Native contaminated lands cleanup programs.

House Republican leaders emphasized the bipartisan nature of the agreement and the return to regular appropriations after reliance on continuing resolutions.

Senate Republicans also emphasized the bipartisan scope of the agreement. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, described the package as fiscally restrained while maintaining core federal investments. “It provides investments in our public lands and upholds our commitments to tribal communities,” Collins said in a statement.

House Republican leaders emphasized the bipartisan nature of the agreement and the return to regular appropriations after reliance on continuing resolutions.

“This bipartisan, bicameral package reflects steady progress toward completing FY26 funding responsibly,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement Monday addressing the FY26 appropriations process and the next set of bills expected to reach the House floor this week. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, said the bills demonstrate how regular order can deliver “critical community projects nationwide.”

If enacted, the package would restore congressional control over tribal funding by reinstating detailed spending directives and preserving advance appropriations and legally required payments the administration had proposed cutting.

If substantiated in customer deliveries, the launch would mark a notable milestone for electrification, bringing solid‑state technology out of the lab and into series vehicles.

The company says it held the news until its all‑solid‑state “Donut Battery” had been fully tested, validated, and installed in vehicles, with first customer deliveries targeted for the current quarter. That makes Q1 2026 (January 1–March 31) the critical window for assessing whether “production‑ready now” translates into real‑world deployments on public roads.

What Donut Lab is putting forward

Donut Lab positions its battery as a no‑compromise platform across performance, safety, longevity, and cost. The headline claim is cell‑level energy density of 400 Wh/kg, paired with five‑minute full charges that do not taper at 80% state of charge. The company also highlights a design life “up to 100,000 cycles” with minimal capacity fade, and intrinsic safety characteristics tied to an all‑solid electrolyte that avoids flammable liquids and metallic dendrites.

Extreme‑temperature resilience is another centerpiece: the company cites greater than 99% capacity retention both at −30°C and above 100°C without signs of ignition or degradation. Donut Lab further asserts reliance on abundant, geopolitically stable materials at system‑level costs below lithium‑ion, and emphasizes form‑factor versatility that supports structural integration, from drone bodies to vehicle chassis. Application specifics center on Verge Motorcycles, which Donut Lab says can now charge in under 10 minutes and gain up to 60 kilometers of combined range per minute of charging, with a long‑range variant rated up to 600 kilometers on a single charge.

Donut Lab’s January 5, 2026 press release states that Verge will have solid‑state powered bikes “on the road in Q1 2026.” Q1 2026 spans January 1 through March 31, 2026; the deliveries are future‑dated within the next 12 weeks, making the claim imminently verifiable. For industry watchers, this short horizon provides an unusual opportunity to see whether lab‑grade claims hold up in day‑to‑day use under public charging and ambient conditions.

Donut Lab’s broader partner roster is designed to showcase range and versatility. WATT Electric Vehicles (WATTEV) plans to debut a functional aluminum skateboard platform integrating Donut in‑wheel motors, inverters, software, and the solid‑state pack. The Cova Power Smart Trailer, a joint venture with Ahola Group, targets up to 54% reductions in diesel consumption and up to 30% in total energy use in freight operations, while defense‑grade programs with ESOX Group will stress the chemistry in rugged environments.

Verification priorities at production scale

The magnitude of Donut Lab’s claims—high energy density, extreme fast charging without taper, ultra‑long cycle life, and temperature resilience—exceeds today’s EV baselines across multiple dimensions simultaneously. Validating this stack at OEM volumes is where solid‑state efforts have historically struggled.

Independent evidence over the current quarter should focus on repeatable fast‑charge behavior and heat rejection at motorcycle pack sizes, including connector standards and cooling strategies. It should also probe interface resistance and mechanical integrity under high C‑rate cycling to confirm dendrite suppression and low impedance over thousands of cycles. Finally, manufacturing must demonstrate consistent yields and credible capacity disclosures that move beyond pilot scales.

The race to full production of solid‑state batteries

A key question is whether other battery makers are also saying their all‑solid‑state EV batteries are “production‑ready now.” As of today—Monday, January 5, 2026—most industry leaders continue to cite pilots, demonstration vehicles, or first commercialization windows clustered around 2027–2028, with broader mass production closer to 2030. Against that backdrop, Donut Lab’s “now” positioning stands out.

Here are other solid-state battery developers’ scheduling goals:

Taken together, the competitive field points to pilots and first commercialization from 2027–2028, with mass production in mainstream automotive applications largely clustered around 2030. That places unusual scrutiny on Donut Lab’s promise to have Verge motorcycles “on the road in Q1 2026,” a claim that will be directly verifiable by March 31, 2026.

The bottom line

Donut Lab’s assertion—production‑ready all‑solid‑state batteries in vehicles now—runs ahead of the timelines publicly stated by most incumbent battery makers. Over the next 12 weeks, real‑world charging logs, thermal telemetry, early cycle‑life snapshots, and manufacturing indicators such as yield, batch consistency, and installed capacity will determine whether this marks a genuine inflection point for solid‑state batteries in transportation—or whether the industry’s 2027–2030 consensus remains the reference frame for mass adoption.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltb8ed797dd01dd869/695bee0aa529eca6b8179154/donut_lab_ssb.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-05 12:59:31.135331

Google will add three Texas data centers powered by renewable energy and a $30 M clean-energy fund.

Data and AI centers increase power load requests from 56 GW to 205 GW, raising concerns about the grid’s capacity and associated costs.

Texas solar and wind increase, but transmission limits and permitting delays threaten progress.

Google’s November 2025 announcement that it plans to construct three new data centers in Texas at a cost of $40 billion is the latest in a series of new projects proposed over the next few years.

At the present time, there are 375 data centers already operating in Austin, Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio, with another 70 currently under construction, according to research and advisory firm Baxtel.

The state offers relatively cheap energy, great expanses of land, and a business-friendly economic environment.

Google’s Plan to Tackle Energy Demands in Texas

However, these facilities are power hungry. This either places more pressure on electrical grids already burdened with regular demand or means the centers themselves need to come up with their own power plan. That’s what Google intends to do.

“Google is committed to responsibly growing its infrastructure by bringing new energy resources onto the grid, paying for costs associated with its operations, and supporting community energy efficiency initiatives,” the company said. “In Texas, this includes a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to scale and accelerate energy initiatives, along with more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity contracted to date through power purchase agreements with energy developers.”

However, it’s not clear whether all the new data centers and AI facilities planned for Texas will be self-powering. Some may be hybrids like the Stargate project near Abilene, which will draw power from its own natural gas generator as well as from the grid.

The first two buildings, OpenAI and Oracle’s Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, are already operational, with the remaining six buildings expected to be completed by mid-2026. Image: OpenAI/Stargate

Texas Grid Under Surging Demand

In September 2024, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an independent, nonprofit organization that operates most of the state’s electric grid, reportedly tracked 56 gigawatts in large load interconnection requests. That number almost quadrupled to 205 gigawatts within a year.

Kristi Hobbs, ERCOT’s vice-president of system planning and weatherization, told a Public Utility Commission of Texas meeting in October that the increased volume of the energy demand from large data centers, particularly those serving artificial intelligence, will require an adjustment of the planning processes to keep the grid reliable.

The increase in demand is likely to cause concern among traditional Texas consumers as summer heat results in peak power demands. In July, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that electricity prices for Texas residential customers and businesses were 24 percent below the national average. In the current environment of data center growth, the cost of electricity is almost certain to increase significantly.

“The sharpest jump will occur in the ERCOT-North hub in Texas, where prices are forecast to surge 45 percent due to high summer demand paired with limited supply,” writes Brien Sheahan, former chairman and CEO of the Illinois Commerce Commission. “While natural gas prices remain a major driver of power costs, the EIA notes that Texas’ 2026 increases reflect large hourly price spikes.”

The state needs to pull out all the stops in order to meet future forecast demands, and renewable energy sources appear to be doing the job.

Renewables Expand but Face Transmission Hurdles

Sean Kelly, co-founder and CEO of energy forecasting company Amperon, writes over the last four years, ERCOT’s solar capacity had increased by more than 200 percent. One reason is that renewables such as wind and solar can come online far faster than traditional natural gas power plants. Kelly also notes since solar has no fuel costs, it operates at a low marginal cost, thus pushing market prices down.

However, the Solar Energy Industries Association has concerns. It says the Donald Trump administration “is using every tool at its disposal to slow down solar and storage projects,” and that “under Washington’s new energy permitting bureaucracy, projects large and small are being trapped in limbo.”

It estimates Texas alone accounts for nearly 40 percent of the at-risk projects. Further data suggests due to insufficient transmission capability, eight TWh of solar and wind power in Texas was curtailed in 2024.

Fortunately, and according to Cleanview’s project tracker in November, politics are not slowing down renewable energy projects. There were 877 solar projects alone under development in Texas. In fact, as of August, ERCOT reported five times the number of solar and wind interconnection requests versus natural gas.

“Combined, wind and solar can now supply up to nearly half of ERCOT’s total electricity demand, which makes the market less reactive to increases in the cost of natural gas,” Kelly continues.

Renewables and accompanying battery storage also help to stabilize supply during peak periods or disruptions of fuel supplies to traditional power plants.

Hopefully, this could mitigate forecast energy cost increases over time. The continued growth of renewables in Texas is the best outcome for all concerned. As Kelly warns, if supply is pinched and electricity costs do in fact increase as much as some are forecasting, those data centers won’t be coming to Texas at all, unless they find the added investment capital to somehow power themselves.

Kelly’s conclusion is compelling.

“The highly politicized national energy debates are missing the point. It’s not about ideology; it’s about doing what works. And what works in Texas is competition, consumer choice, and resources that prove their worth economically. If we continue to let data — not dogma — drive energy decisions here, Texas will be fine, and we might just show the rest of the country a thing or two in the process.”

The company opened its Plaquemines export terminal in December 2024.","Louisiana regulators are considering a revision to an existing coastal use permit that would allow LNG export terminal operator Venture Global to expand dredging along the Calcasieu Ship Channer near the mouth of the Gulf of America, an area commercial fishermen and shrimpers contend is vulnerable to adverse impacts on water quality, according to a recent filing at the Office of Coastal Management.

At a site on Monkey Island between the Calcasieu Ship Channel and Calcasieu Pass, Venture Global plans to build its second LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, named CP2 LNG, subject to government approval.

The Arlington, Virginia-based company seeks to create two berths for loading ships at the terminal, which would be located adjacent and to the north of the company’s existing Calcasieu Pass plant. Venture Global plans to move the dredged materials about 9.7 miles along an established pipeline route for beneficial placement in the Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge.

Venture Global’s nearby Calcasieu Pass plant began producing liquified natural gas in January 2022 at a 1,000-acre site on the east bank of the Ship Channel, close to the entrance to the Gulf.

Environmental groups and area fishermen and shrimpers are suing to block the new facility, claiming regulators have not adequately assessed the cumulative environmental impacts of it when considered alongside other LNG export facilities in the area currently operating or in the planning stages.

Two of the groups, For a Better Bayou and Fishermen Involved in Sustaining our Heritage, claim the project threatens their existence. They argue that intensive dredging, sometimes occurring seven days a week during peak fishing seasons, smothers oyster beds, shrimp and fish with sediment.

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, which includes the Office of Coastal Management, will take public comments on the proposed dredging expansion until Jan. 14.

The permit would allow Venture Global to move watterbottom and materials dredged during the construction of the CP2 LNG marine terminal, along with other materials produced in maintenance work at the company’s existing Calcasieu Pass facility, for placement within 729 acres of open water and highly fragmented marsh inside the wildlife refuge.

In August, environmental groups and local fishermen complained when the Venture Global dredge spilled mud they said made its way into Big Lake and covered hundreds of acres of marsh. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in September confirmed claims that mud released during the August dredge spill entered Big Lake and affected the fisheries.

In October, For a Better Bayou, FISH, Natural Resources Defense Council, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network, Healthy Gulf and others filed a lawsuit challenging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the terminal and feeder pipeline in southwest Louisiana. The brief argues that the commission failed to consider significant, concrete harms to local industry and communities.

A Lake Charles restaurant filed a lawsuit in November seeking less than $10,000 in damages from its local oyster supplier, Pig & Rooster Oyster Farms, which has filed a third-party demand with Venture Global, alleging the company’s dredging spill last August caused silt and mud to cover the company’s floating oyster cages, according to a report by KPLC-TV.

The restaurant, Salt Revival House, claimed it received oysters “that were “dead, contaminated, discolored, or otherwise unfit for use and consumption,” according to the report. The farm states that the “vast majority” of 5.2 million oysters harvested since the spill have been unfit for sale or consumption.

Additionally, the oyster farm is asking a judge to halt Venture Global’s dredging operations until it complies with permits.

,Texas Environment,2026-01-05 16:56:56+00:00,Environment America Research & Policy Center,What to know about the Lavaca River dam - Environment America,Ty Gribble,,,,,https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/what-to-know-about-the-lavaca-river-dam/,"A proposed dam on the Lavaca River, some 100 miles southwest of Houston, would divert 31 billion gallons of water annually while threatening Lavaca Bay’s oyster reefs, fish populations, and an already contaminated ecosystem.

The Lavaca-Navidad River Authority’s “Lake Texana Yield Enhancement Project” has faced massive opposition, with more than 500 public comments and contested case hearing requests submitted to TCEQ commissioners. As Texas regulators decide whether to grant public hearings or issue the permit outright, conservationists, fishermen, and community advocates are fighting to protect one of Texas’s last naturally flowing major rivers to the Gulf.

What the proposal does

The project would authorize the Lavaca-Navidad River Authority (LNRA) to divert approximately one-sixth of the river’s annual flow. This marks the first time in 50 years that the small river authority has sought additional water rights. It includes a diversion dam impounding 240 acre-feet on the Lavaca River and a massive off-channel reservoir on Keller Creek with 16 billion gallons of storage capacity. The reservoir would be built on land currently owned by Formosa Plastics, located approximately two miles east of the company’s Point Comfort chemical complex. Under the proposed arrangement, LNRA would purchase the land from Formosa, and the petrochemical giant would receive “first rights” to a portion of the water.

Two customers currently account for 98% of water sales agreements in the entire Lavaca-Navidad basin: the City of Corpus Christi and Formosa Plastics, consuming roughly equal amounts. The driving force for this expansion has been industry, as LNRA General Manager Patrick Brzozowski said: “There is interest in our area to develop industrial plants. That’s where the demand is going to come from.”

Throughout 2025, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has been reviewing the Lavaca-Navidad River Authority’s water permit application. Commissioners must decide whether to grant contested case hearings or issue the permit directly. If TCEQ grants the hearings, the project would proceed to the State Office of Administrative Hearings for proceedings that could delay construction for years. If commissioners issue the permit directly, construction could begin on a diversion dam and 2,500-acre off-channel reservoir that would fundamentally alter freshwater flows to Lavaca Bay.

Diane Wilson, an activist who won a historic $50 million settlement against Formosa Plastics in 2019, has emerged as a leading opponent of the dam. In August, Wilson won a lawsuit against the local school board over inadequate public notice ahead of a hearing on a tax abatement for a proposed $10 billion ExxonMobil plastics plant on Lavaca Bay. Then in October, ExxonMobil announced that it would postpone building that facility, telling the Texas Tribune that, “Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development.”

Opposition to the proposal

Diverting freshwater from the bay will harm coastal wildlife habitats. Estuaries like Lavaca Bay depend on freshwater inflows to maintain the salinity balance that supports fish, oysters, and other birds. The mixing of fresh water from the Lavaca River with salt water from the Gulf creates brackish conditions that are essential for these species to thrive. Texas Water Development Board studies show that the Lavaca River should contribute 346,200 acre-feet of freshwater annually to maintain healthy conditions in the bay. The proposed dam would divert 96,022 acre-feet—more than a quarter of that target amount—potentially seriously disrupting this balance and making the bay saltier.

Opposition to the dam has united a broad coalition of supporters. Conservation groups, including the National Wildlife Foundation, the Matagorda Bay Foundation, and the Coastal Conservation Association, are collaborating with fishing groups, Lavaca River Ranch, and Hilcorp Energy to oppose the project.

The Coastal Conservation Association in Texas has identified specific concerns with the permit application regarding the impacts of the diversion dam on freshwater inflows to Lavaca Bay. The reduced freshwater would harm numerous species that depend on the bay. These ecosystems are shaped by the salinity of their water. Diversion of freshwater could make these waters far saltier and through these ecosystems into chaos.

Oysters are particularly vulnerable. They thrive in brackish water with salinity between 10-30 parts per thousand (ppt) but cannot survive salinity below 5 ppt for more than a brief period. They are vital to the coastal ecosystem, filtering up to 50 gallons of water daily and providing shelter for more than 300 species in their reefs.

These changes would endanger birds as well. Redhead ducks winter in Matagorda Bay and feed on seagrass that requires the right salinity levels. Endangered whooping cranes rely on the bay’s blue crabs for food during migration.The livelihoods of many fishermen, shrimpers, and oyster harvesters depend entirely on maintaining the health of this coastal ecosystem.

How petrochemical expansion harms Texas’ environment

Beyond saltier waters potentially harming our wildlife, the dam will enable the expansion of petrochemical manufacturing and lead to more pollution of our environment. Formosa’s planned facilities would add approximately 167 tons of pollutants annually to the air. The company has already paid $2.85 million in fines for violations of the Clean Air Act, due to the release of chlorine and other hazardous substances.

Beyond air pollution, Formosa has a well-documented history of discharging preproduction plastic pellets—known as nurdles—into Lavaca Bay and surrounding waterways. Despite a 2019 settlement requiring zero discharge of plastics, the company has violated this agreement more than 700 times since 2019, accumulating millions in fines, according to the San Antonio Bay Estuarian Waterkeeper. These tiny plastic pellets contaminate beaches, are consumed by wildlife, and persist in the environment indefinitely.

What’s Next

Texans should not let LNRA expose our coastal ecosystems to unnecessary and detrimental plastic manufacturing. Our coast is worth protecting, and allowing this water diversion project will endanger more of Texas’s wildlife and natural beauty.",https://environmentamerica.org/center/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lavaca_river.png,N,,2026-01-05 13:59:37.578837

Live Update At 10:04:18 EST: On Monday, January 05, 2026 Valero Energy Corporation stock [NYSE: VLO] is trending up by 9.65%! Discover the key drivers behind this movement as well as our expert analysis in the detailed breakdown below.

VLO’s Financial Standing: Recent Earnings and Key Figures

As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade says, “I focus on what a stock is doing, not what I want it to do. Let the stock prove itself before you make a move.” For many traders, this perspective is crucial for successful trading. Instead of imposing their own expectations on stock movements, they should let the market guide their decisions. This approach emphasizes patience and observation, allowing the trends to reveal themselves and ensure that their actions align with market realities. Such a method not only helps in minimizing impulsive decisions but also strengthens disciplined trading practices.

When we glance at Valero’s recent earnings report, a mixed yet fascinating picture emerges. The energy behemoth’s revenue has clocked in at a staggering $129.9 billion, revealing its massive scale and reach. Yet, despite this grandeur, their profit margins hover modestly with a gross margin of 4.6% and a profit margin of 1.17%. Such margins are typical of the energy sector, characterized by large volumes and tight margins.

Valero’s price-to-earnings ratio stands at 33.81, hinting at investor optimism or perhaps an overvaluation. Moreover, the company’s debt dynamics are intriguing; with a total debt to equity ratio of 0.45, Valero appears to be managing its debts prudently. Their long-term debt is part of a larger strategy, possibly aimed at financing new projects or expanding existing capacities.

A deeper look at their free cash flow of $1.7 billion reveals operational robustness. They generated a healthy operating cash flow of $1.88 billion, which surpasses their capital expenditures. Yet, their repurchase of capital stock suggests a focus on increasing shareholder value through buybacks – a double-edged sword in financial maneuvers.

Valero’s management effectiveness comes through strongly in several areas. Their return on assets is 7.99%, and return on equity impressively hits 20.7%. These figures underscore an effective use of equity in generating net income, painting a picture of efficient financial engineering.

Considering the recent collaborative initiatives with Darling Ingredients, Valero is showcasing a potential shift towards sustainable ventures, aligning with global energy trends. These efforts – selling production tax credits from their renewable diesel work under the Inflation Reduction Act – underscore Valero’s drive towards not only profitability but sustainability.

Understanding the Market Pulse: Recent Stock Movements

The stock world buzzes with Valero’s recent movements. After adjustments to analysts’ price targets – notably Raymond James and BMO Capital – a sense of reevaluation permeated the market. Such downgrades often lead to transient dips, and VLO wasn’t immune. But do these revisions signal deeper financial concerns or merely cautious forecasting amid fluctuating market conditions?

Valero’s close market observation reveals a steady yet volatile trajectory. On Dec 31, their stock saw a slight decline, closing at $162.79 from a previous high of $165.01. Yet, soon after, on Jan 2, it bounced back to $165.31, showcasing inherent volatility within the energy sector.

Intraday trading also illustrates Valero’s vibrant dynamics. Opening at $179.69 and peaking at $183.48 on Jan 5, Valero’s shares exude an underlying resilience. The interplay between long-term strategies and short-term market reactions defines this energy giant’s current stock performance.

While revenue has dipped slightly over the past three years by 10.3%, the five-year growth rate at 10.07% strikes a fairly balanced picture. Valero appears optimistic enough to invest significantly in future capacities, reflected by their long-term assets and capital infrastructure commitments.

The stories behind the figures are crucial. One remembers how once, in a fleeting casual chat, a seasoned trader likened Valero’s market ebbs and flows to ocean tides – relentless, yet majestic. Such tales hammer home the essence of understanding energy markets; it’s not just about numbers, it’s about grasping the broader economic currents.

As one deciphers the significance behind these numbers, a tale of ambition and calculated risk unfolds. Valero’s determined navigation through sustainability corridors, financial prudence in debt management, and relentless pursuit of growth are echoed in their fluctuating yet upward-sloped stock charts.

What Lies Ahead for Valero?

Amid the backdrop of redefined price targets and strategic ventures, Valero stands at a crossroads. Questions linger: Will these financial maneuvers manifest into tangible stock appreciation? Are the production tax credit strategies innovative enough to boost long-term valuations?

Consider Valero’s market agility. They strategically adjust to external pressures – such as global energy shifts and policy changes like the Inflation Reduction Act. Through such shifts, Valero’s narratives weave a fabric of an adaptable, forward-looking corporation, keen on leveraging both traditional and renewable energy sources.

As traders weigh Valero’s potential trajectory, it’s important to remember the wisdom imparted by Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade, who says, “The best way to learn is by tracking trades, wins, losses, and lessons learned. Every trade has something to teach.” The story of Valero’s journey is enriched by its history of adaptation and strategic decisions. Valero’s roadmap, punctuated by innovation and judicious fiscal management, continues to form an inviting but complex tapestry. Its resilience, highlighted by adept market moves and strategic investments, prompts the intriguing question: Are we witnessing mere market tremors or the prelude to yet another phase of a robust Valero expansion?

In total, the appropriations bills reject more than $163 billion in proposed cuts to public services, helps to address the cost of living crisis, and protects funding for key Democratic priorities like clean energy, environmental protection, scientific research and public safety grants.

Summaries of funding bills included in the package can be found here: CJS; E&W; Interior.

“This legislation is a forceful rejection of draconian cuts to public services proposed by the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (CT-03). “As the cost of living crisis exacerbated by the Trump Administration continues to worsen, this package makes meaningful investments to bring down costs for utility bills and provides substantial funding for clean energy. It makes our communities safer by increasing funding for Violence Against Women Act and other public safety grants. And it protects our environment, national parks, public lands, natural resources, and endangered species, rejecting more than $9.5 billion in proposed Republican cuts.

“Additionally, there is not a single Republican poison pill provision in this bill. Despite their efforts to include over 140 hyper-partisan line items that would have weakened gun safety regulations, expanded oil and gas leasing on federal land, diminished investments in renewable energy, and imposed cruel culture-war constraints on LGBTQ+ Americans, none of these provisions was ultimately included. Democrats successfully defeated every single one.

“Perhaps most importantly, this legislation reasserts Congress’s power of the purse. Rather than another short-sighted stop-gap measure that affords the Trump Administration broader discretion, this full-year funding package restrains the White House through precise, legally binding spending requirements. There is still much more work to do before January 30, but this is an important first step. I look forward to casting my vote in favor of this package.”

For instance, the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act provided incentives for critical mineral production through the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit.
Mining Projects Bring Social and Environmental Risks Several companies are already developing critical mineral projects across the U.S., often in small rural communities.
Tribal Nations and Native communities have been disproportionately impacted by the mining sector in the past and are especially exposed to new critical mineral mines.
Some New Mines Are Seeing Pushback Historically, mining projects in the U.S. have done little, if anything, to involve local communities in the development process.","The area around California's Salton Sea is incredibly rich in lithium — enough to support over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. A new mine, dubbed Hell's Kitchen, plans to tap this vast mineral wealth. Once completed, it will be among the largest lithium producers in the world.

Hell's Kitchen is one of several new mines that have been fast-tracked by the U.S. federal government as part of an ongoing push to scale up domestic critical mineral supplies. Demand for these minerals — which include lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements and others — is surging both in the U.S. and globally, in part thanks to the rise of clean energy technologies like electric vehicles, utility-scale energy storage and solar panels. This rising need is rapidly outpacing U.S. production, meaning the country will have to both increase imports and scale domestic mining in the coming years.

While critical minerals are essential to securing a clean energy future, mining is an extractive practice with environmental and social risks that has historically done more harm than good. This legacy, especially for Tribal Nations and Native communities, has created deep distrust and widespread opposition to new projects in the U.S.

The Salton Sea is no stranger to these pitfalls. For all the area's mineral riches, it is economically poor. It's seen a long history of one-sided extraction projects that have largely failed to improve the lives of working people.

These concerns are at the fore for many as the U.S. enters a new era of mining. Some projects are already facing significant opposition and litigation, delaying development and increasing financial risks for developers.

Meaningful community engagement will be crucial moving forward — not only to unlock development and meet the country's resource needs, but to avoid harm and provide tangible benefits to the communities hosting these projects.

Amid Booming Mineral Demand, U.S. Seeks Domestic Supplies

In the U.S., critical minerals are those that are essential to the economy and national security and have a vulnerable supply chain.

These minerals are ubiquitous in modern technologies, from medical devices and defense equipment to cell phones and televisions. They're also needed to build solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and other clean technologies increasingly powering our daily lives. This is a big part of the reason demand is booming today.

While 60 minerals are considered ""critical"" by the U.S. Geological Survey, around 10 are essential to the clean energy transition, including lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, aluminum and zinc.

Recent analysis suggests that demand for certain critical minerals will far outstrip the United States' domestic supply in the coming years. For instance, the U.S. is expected to produce around 28,000 metric tons of lithium in 2035. But demand could reach over 100,000 metric tons — more than triple this output.

How the country will meet this need is an urgent question. The U.S. currently relies 100% on imports for 12 out of 60 critical minerals, while another 28 have a net import reliance of over 50%. This poses challenges to supply chain security. For example, China controls 70% of global rare earth mining and 90% of refining and has leveraged this dominance as a political tool by restricting exports to the U.S. and other countries.

While metal recycling may be able to help meet domestic demand in the future, scaling up mining will be necessary in the near term.

Both recent federal administrations have seen critical mineral supply chains as a key priority and taken steps to shore up domestic production. For instance, the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act provided incentives for critical mineral production through the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. (This was amended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to include a phaseout by 2034.)

In March 2025, President Trump issued an executive order to ""facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent."" This order created a list of priority critical minerals projects and invoked the Defense Production Act to expedite permitting processes on federal lands. Thirteen domestic critical minerals projects have been fast-tracked under this order since April 2025, with a further 37 on the permitting transparency dashboard.

Although the permitting process for new mines in the U.S. is notably lengthy and complex, rushing to expedite them without meaningful community engagement and consultation with Tribal Nations is likely to cause problems.

Mining Projects Bring Social and Environmental Risks

Several companies are already developing critical mineral projects across the U.S., often in small rural communities. If not managed responsibly, these projects can come with significant environmental and social risks for nearby communities.

For one, mining waste can contaminate local water supplies. Some extraction methods also require significant amounts of water. This can lead to conflicts, particularly in agricultural communities where water is already scarce. Mining activities can also damage wildlife habitat and biodiversity and pollute the air.

Hell's Kitchen, for example, would operate in a part of California already grappling with water scarcity, water pollution, and air pollution that drives high rates of asthma. Several environmental groups have voiced worries that the project would put further strain on water supplies, worsen air quality and generate hazardous waste.

In addition, mining can lead to economic booms and busts if a community becomes overly reliant on a single, non-renewable industry. For small communities, a major influx of workers can overwhelm local roads, services and housing, increasing traffic and straining public infrastructure.

Tribal Nations and Native communities have been disproportionately impacted by the mining sector in the past and are especially exposed to new critical mineral mines. An analysis of U.S. mineral reserves found that a high percentage — 97% for nickel, 89% for copper, 79% for lithium and 68% for cobalt — are located within 35 miles of Native American reservations. Although not necessarily located on reservations themselves, the reserves are often located on land that has cultural, ancestral and historic significance, placing many tribal communities in the direct path of new mining operations.

Some experts have pointed out that the recent increase in domestic critical mineral production has already reignited historic conflicts over tribal sovereignty between Native American people and the federal government.

Some New Mines Are Seeing Pushback

Historically, mining projects in the U.S. have done little, if anything, to involve local communities in the development process. Many left the surrounding area worse off economically and environmentally. This has left many communities feeling ignored or betrayed by companies and, in some cases, the government.

As a result, new mines in the U.S. often face significant local pushback. This can lead to litigation, long project delays or even cancellation, as well as reputational damage for companies. Several critical mineral projects in the U.S. are facing such opposition today.

For example, the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada — expected to be a major source of lithium for EV batteries — has faced legal challenges from the Numu/Nuwu and Newe (Northern Paiute and Western Shoshone) and environmental groups over water use and potential groundwater contamination. They've also raised concerns about the lack of free, prior and informed consent for local Tribes and limiting access to culturally significant land.

Hell's Kitchen faced a similar lawsuit in 2024. Environmental groups argued that the environmental impact report failed to analyze and mitigate concerns around air quality and hazardous waste, and that local agencies did not consult with local Tribes — including Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, Kwaaymii Laguna Band of Indians and Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians — as required by law.

It is worth noting that local support or opposition can vary significantly, and no Tribe or community is a monolith.

For example, the Black Butte copper mine has faced multiple lawsuits from environmental groups due to concerns that the project was granted permits based on insufficient environmental impact reviews. Yet some residents welcome the project for its potential to create new jobs in the area.

In the case of Hell's Kitchen, some of the groups that brought about the 2024 lawsuit have stated that they are not necessarily against the development of the mine, seeing it as an opportunity for new jobs and other local benefits. However, they want the project to commit to ensuring good jobs and a healthy environment while respecting Indigenous rights and protecting Tribal resources.

Strategies for Robust Community Engagement

There is no silver bullet to address mining's impacts. But there are many ways governments and companies can tangibly improve the sector, and meaningful community engagement is a critical foundation. Below we outline three strategies that can help encourage local engagement, mitigate harms, and lead to positive outcomes for communities hosting critical minerals projects:

1) Securing real benefits for communities through benefits-sharing agreements

New mines are often billed as an opportunity for nearby communities. But they don't always deliver. Benefits-sharing frameworks — such as community benefits agreement (CBAs), good neighbor agreements (GNAs) or Tribal Benefit Agreements (TBAs) — can help.

These are voluntary but legally binding mechanisms between project developers and local communities that help ensure mines avoid harm and bring real benefits to local people. When designed well, they can help foster trust, address local concerns and enable groups to hold project developers accountable, while also curbing opposition to new projects.

The Stillwater Mine Good Neighbor Agreement in Montana is a strong example. The GNA establishes water quality metrics that are more stringent than state and federal requirements and incorporates rigorous monitoring to ensure compliance. The mining company, Sibanye-Stillwater, funds independent environmental performance audits each year. The GNA also established processes for local groups to monitor mine operations, access data, conduct inspections, and weigh in on mine plans and permit revisions, fostering trust and transparency.

The Stillwater agreement also takes a robust approach to dispute resolution. Its multi-tiered process starts with good faith negotiation, moves to binding arbitration by a neutral third party if talks fail, and ultimately allows for civil enforcement in court to uphold the contract. Thanks to this, there has been no arbitration or litigation around the Stillwater mine since the GNA came into effect in 2000.

Despite its successes, some advocates have pointed out that Stillwater's GNA does not go beyond mitigating potential harms to deliver broader community benefits. Benefits-sharing agreements are considered most effective when they also secure things like direct job guarantees or infrastructure investments that ensure long-term community well-being.

Stillwater has inspired similar agreements, including one being negotiated for the Black Butte Copper mine in Montana. In the case of Hell's Kitchen, a coalition of local nonprofits has called for a community benefits agreement ""to strike a balance for community prosperity and environmental protection.""

Some mining companies have successfully engaged communities without signing a formal benefits-sharing agreement. Eagle Mine, the only primary nickel producer in the country, initially faced organized opposition. But its operators created formal procedures to engage with local groups that gradually overcame this pushback. The company created a ""community environmental monitoring program"" and invested in the local economy and education. Lundin Mining, the current operator, has also developed a voluntary community monitoring system; it uses a third-party organization to survey community sentiment toward the mine every six months, which is incorporated into its decision-making.

However, this kind of voluntary corporate engagement remains the exception rather than the norm. And it doesn't offer tools to hold companies accountable. Because of this, legally binding agreements are seen as a more effective option. They can empower communities to secure specific, long-term benefits and provide a more structured and reliable approach to development.

2) Improving regulation to give communities a seat at the table

Most states require mining companies to obtain various permits that involve mandatory public notice and comment periods. This gives community members a chance to provide input to state agencies.

However, Montana has gone a step further: Its Hard Rock Mining Impact Act (HRMIA) is considered unique in that it gives communities formal standing and leverage to address mining impacts.

HRMIA requires any developer of a large-scale hard rock mine to prepare an impact plan that describes its expected social and economic impacts on local government entities — such as counties, cities and school districts — who can then negotiate with the mining company for funding to address them. This might include money for things like new infrastructure, public health services or road maintenance. In 2020, for example, Meagher County and the City of White Sulphur Springs received $437,000 from Black Butte copper mine's developer. This kind of upfront funding is intended to address infrastructure and service needs and financial gaps before the expanded tax base from the mining operation begins to provide revenue.

Montana created a Hard Rock Mining Impact Board that reviews impact plans for compliance and can adjudicate disputes between local governments and companies. The five-member board balances local government, community, industry and finance interests by mandating that at least three members must be from an area affected by large-scale mining development, one member from the hard rock mining industry, and one from a major financial institution in the state.

A companion law, the Property Tax Base Sharing Act, ensures that 35% of metal mines tax revenues are allocated to local governments to mitigate the fiscal impacts of mining operations. The state law also requires counties to place at least 37.5% of that allocation into a designated savings account: a ""rainy-day"" fund to be used in the event of a mine shutdown or major workforce reduction.

Montana's framework, especially its provisions for mitigating local fiscal and infrastructure impacts from large mines, can be a model for other states and the federal government.

3) Leveraging third-party sustainability frameworks

Voluntary, third-party sustainability frameworks — such as the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) and The Copper Mark — can be powerful tools for any project looking to demonstrate a commitment to industry best practices. These frameworks ensure responsible mining by setting rigorous standards for environmental and social performance; providing independent verification; increasing transparency; and building trust among stakeholders, such as communities, buyers and investors.

Frameworks also provide common standards for community engagement, including proactively identifying and engaging with vulnerable and Tribal stakeholders, documenting input received from communities and addressing their concerns. And they include independent assessments of whether a mine is meeting relevant requirements. While not a substitute for strong government regulation, if used well, these frameworks can help identify and mitigate sustainability risks and improve relations with the local community.

Yet uptake is limited, including in the U.S. IRMA, considered by some to be the most rigorous sustainability framework, has not independently assessed a single mine in the United States to date. Copper Mark is an exception; it has been awarded to 11 out of 25 operating copper mines in the U.S., which is significant.

With an estimated 280 metal mines operating in the U.S., there's substantial potential to expand the use of voluntary sustainability frameworks. By increasing their reach, these frameworks could play a critical role in raising the performance of the U.S. mining sector, particularly in areas like meaningful and equitable community engagement.

Moving Forward

These strategies offer concrete pathways for the U.S. to build a more responsible mining industry. They're not the only ones.

Additional approaches have been proposed by academics, researchers and others that will also be crucial to improving the sector. This includes the need for restorative justice to address the United States' harmful mining history through long-term truth and reconciliation processes between the federal government and Tribal Nations. The sector also needs to consider economic models that emphasize reduction, reuse and recycling of resources to minimize the need for new mining.

Ultimately, the United States must create a project and policy environment that builds transparency, opens spaces for negotiation, fosters accountability and proactively managed environmental risks. This will be the only way forward to ensure that clean energy drives truly equitable and resilient growth.

WFDD listener John Swain recently asked how the city earned this distinction and whether it still has the recognition. For this week’s Carolina Curious, reporter DJ Simmons spoke with Greensboro Director of Transportation Hanna Cockburn to learn more.

The League of American Bicyclists is a national organization dedicated to improving riding conditions for cyclists throughout the country. The nonprofit designates some municipalities as bicycle-friendly communities.

Cockburn says cities are recognized by improving conditions for bicycling through policies, infrastructure and education programs. Greensboro first received its designation in 2009.

“I've personally lived in Greensboro for nearly 30 years, and I can say, from my own perspective, that the environment for cycling, and the support for cycling continues to grow and has really improved over that time,” she says.

Cockburn says some of the city’s improvements include investing in its greenway system and its Safe Routes to School Program that educates young people on safe cycling.

“The way we think about it is a network of interconnected systems that serve pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders all together,” she says.

Cockburn says the recognition solidifies the work the city has done to improve conditions for bicycling.

“It extends beyond our greenways and is reflected in the bike lane configurations that we have installed as we are able to through the resurfacing process,"" she says. ""So, I think it's a real feather in our cap.”

“They are perhaps overly pessimistic about the impact of costs” on public support, said Tanase.
“Our data showed that when the UK MPs believed there was insufficient support for some of the policies, they were less willing to speak up in support of the policy.
However, even after these interventions, the politicians still underestimated public support by about 7%, so the misperceptions were not dispelled completely.
Furthermore, said Tanase: “There is intentional disinformation – there’s a lot of people who have an interest in climate support being muted.","“There may have been a silent majority in favour of windfarms and higher petrol taxes, but if there was, these people were mighty quiet. Essentially, all I ever heard from was people objecting to them.” That was the view of a former UK MP who took part in new research that reveals how significantly British and Belgian politicians underestimate the public’s support for climate action.

From solar power and energy efficiency to meat taxes and frequent flyer levies, the politicians consistently failed to appreciate people’s appetite for policies that tackle global heating. The misapprehension has real world consequences: those politicians were less willing to vote for or speak up for those policies, according to the study.

The good news was that when a group of the politicians were told the true level of polling support for some policies, this improved their estimates of support for other green policies. However, it did not correct the underestimates completely, indicating that the information the politicians used to form their views of public opinion are misleading.

“Based on recent research, I think some of these issues with the information environment has to do with a rightwing bias where the voices of conservative leaning members of the public tend to be overrepresented, for a range of systemic reasons,” says Lisa-Maria Tanase, an academic at the University of Cambridge who led the research. “They tend to be more privileged, educated and politically engaged segments of society.” Anti-climate disinformation from lobby groups also contributes, she says.

A huge 89% majority of the world’s people want stronger action to fight the climate crisis, studies have shown, but are trapped in a self-fulfilling “spiral of silence” because they mistakenly believe they are in a minority. Making people aware that their pro-climate view is, in fact, by far the majority could unlock a social tipping point and help push leaders into the climate action so urgently needed, experts have said.

However, while the views of the public have been widely studied, relatively little was known about the extent to which lawmakers underestimate support for climate action. To address this, Tanase surveyed 100 current UK MPs, broadly reflecting the current political spread in parliament, and more than 600 Flemish politicians in Belgium.

The UK MPs were asked in early 2025 to estimate the level of public support for green policies and their answers were compared with an Ipsos poll of the public that asked the same questions. When asked about a tax on frequent fliers and taxes to reflect how environmentally friendly products are, the MPs thought only a minority supported them, when a majority actually did: the MPs underestimated support by about 15%.

They also underestimated public support for a tax on red meat and dairy products by 18% and for grants or loans to help people to make their homes more energy-efficient by 7%.

Even when told that the members of the public surveyed had also received a clear description of the personal costs of the climate policies, MPs still significantly underestimated support. “They are perhaps overly pessimistic about the impact of costs” on public support, said Tanase. She was recently awarded a PhD for the research, which is in the process of being published in a prominent journal.

“We saw these misperceptions had direct consequences on climate policy progress,” Tanase added. “Our data showed that when the UK MPs believed there was insufficient support for some of the policies, they were less willing to speak up in support of the policy. In the Belgian case, they were less likely to vote for the policy in the local parliament.”

Tanase also interviewed former UK MPs: “They said one of the key barriers to them implementing stronger climate action is the fact that the public, in their opinion, was simply not ready. Due to these misperceptions, even willing politicians who want to do more felt their hands were tied.”

The much larger group of Belgian politicians meant that Tanase could test whether revealing the true level of public support helped change their misperceptions by a statistically significant amount. In this experiment, the politicians’ answers were compared with those from a poll by the University of Antwerp. Both the politicians and members of the public were from Flanders, a region in north Belgium.

For policies to increase taxes on short-haul airline tickets and to prevent local authorities blocking windfarms, the Belgian politicians also thought only a minority of the public supported them, when in fact a majority did, underestimating the support by about 25%. Similar results were found for subsidising solar panels and pricing products according to their environmental impacts.

When the politicians were informed of the true level of support, their estimates of support for further green policies they were asked about were 10 percentage points higher than those in a control group. However, even after these interventions, the politicians still underestimated public support by about 7%, so the misperceptions were not dispelled completely.

“The interventions are competing in an information environment where the politicians are being bombarded with conflicting information and loud opposition,” Tanase said. They told her that in gauging public opinion, they most trusted direct interactions with citizens from their constituencies and their letters, a finding supported by earlier research. “The people more likely to engage with politicians are very specific types politically – they don’t necessarily represent the majority,” she said.

One senior policymaker Tanase spoke to said: “It is plausible that politicians are influenced by the fact that they hear much more from those who stand to lose from green policies than from those who stand to gain.” Other studies have found politicians tend to overrate the public popularity of rightwing policies.

Furthermore, said Tanase: “There is intentional disinformation – there’s a lot of people who have an interest in climate support being muted. There’s a lot of fake news and sensational headlines that we hear and that the MPs will also hear.”

Tanase has already engaged with policymakers in the UK and EU, and prompted a study of perception gaps among MPs in Denmark. She said increasing awareness of the problems in the information environment can make people – including politicians – less vulnerable to misperceptions.

“Showing there is stronger support than assumed could give encouragement that there is public backing [for climate action] and that it’s politically viable,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cee7c5ee7e12e8a761e6a19fc52ef331cc711b30/463_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b2d0eefcb6b04d9248ed401f47e544e",N,,2026-01-05 11:58:27.271077

Target Markets: Utility-scale BESS, EVs, and commercial and industrial customers.

Status: Capital secured. Project development and site planning underway.

Outlook on Waaree Lithium-Ion Battery Manufacturing Plant in India

The success of Waaree’s lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility hinges on technology use, yield outlook and cost competitiveness against established Asian cell manufacturers. However, with storage demand forecast to grow rapidly through the late 2020s and policy support increasingly aligned with domestic manufacturing, the long-term strategy appears feasible. If delivered on schedule and scaled to 20 GWh efficiently, the plant could become a key manufacturing asset in India’s storage value chain.

Industry data also shows BESS tender volumes expanding rapidly. This is driven by renewable generation requirements, peak-shaving mandates and transmission-constrained regions. A 20 GWh domestic facility in India would reduce import dependence and improve delivery timelines for developers. The plant will also support India’s renewable energy industrial policy. For Waaree, the capital raise allows for a bundled renewable offering. This spans solar modules, inverters, and now, batteries.

Hiring Discrimination Against Transgender Job Applicants in the U.S. Labor Market

Emily Beam, University of Vermont; Ivy Stanton, University of Mannheim

Abstract: Discrimination against transgender individuals harms their well-being and contributes to lower incomes and higher poverty rates. Access to employment opportunities is a critical determinant of lifetime earnings and other outcomes, yet surveys document frequent discrimination against transgender individuals. While recent studies show hiring discrimination against transgender applicants, analyses examining intersections with gender and race remain limited, as does research on geographic variation, particularly given differences in state and local anti-trans policies. We conducted a correspondence study to measure discrimination against transgender applicants and examine how it varies with applicant gender and race. We submitted roughly 5,600 resumes for entry-level jobs in food and retail sectors across 49 markets in 2023–2024. We signaled gender identity and race through names, pronouns, and statements about differently gendered legal names to indicate transgender identity. We measured differences in callback rate between cisgender and transgender applicants and examined results by gender identity (cisgender and transgender women and men, as well as nonbinary applicants) and race (Black vs. White applicants). Additionally, we tested for heterogeneity between more and less trans-friendly states, using data on recently introduced or passed state-level anti-trans legislation. This research provides large-scale experimental evidence on how gender identity, race, geography, and policy environments intersect in labor market discrimination. The results identify which demographic groups and geographic areas face the most severe employment discrimination, informing targeted policy interventions to protect transgender job-seekers.

Race, Ethnicity, and Nonpayment of Unemployment Insurance: The Role of the Employer

Marta Lachowska, Institute for Employment Research; Stephen A. Woodbury, Michigan State University

Abstract: This study examines whether Unemployment Insurance claimants who are Black, Hispanic, or Asian are more likely than White claimants to have their claims disputed by an employer or ultimately denied by the UI agency—issues that are central to ongoing concerns about equity in access to UI benefits. Using UI administrative wage and claim records from Washington state from 2005 to 2013, we estimate the extent to which differences in claim disputes and denials across racial and ethnic groups can be explained by observable differences in worker characteristics, claim characteristics (such as conditions of job separation), and employer behavior. Our primary interest is in the role employers play in these outcomes. We estimate linear probability models of dispute or denial, including indicators for race and ethnicity, characteristics of the claimant and the claim, and a leave-one-out measure of the employer’s average dispute or denial rate. We first apply the decomposition method developed by Gelbach (2016) to quantify the importance of differences in claimant characteristics versus employer behavior. We condition on employer-specific dispute and denial rates to assess whether workers of different racial and ethnic backgrounds systematically sort across employers. Second, we conduct a “switcher” analysis of workers with multiple UI claims filed with different employers, which isolates the influence of employer behavior on disputes and denials. In particular, we examine whether the impact of an employer’s probability of disputing a claim varies with the worker’s race or ethnicity. We also examine whether differences by race and ethnicity in employer-dispute rates ultimately lead to differences in UI denial rates or whether the UI agency is able to mitigate the effects of employer behavior. We conclude by discussing the implications of employer-driven disparities for the functioning of the UI system.

The “Great Reshuffling” and Entrepreneurship

Matthew Denes, Carnegie Mellon University; Spyridon Lagaras, University of Illinois; Margarita Tsoutsoura, Washington University in St. Louis

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a paradigm shift in labor markets toward nontraditional employment arrangements, with flexibility increasingly developing into a critical differentiating factor. We study the impact of the “Great Reshuffling” on transitions into entrepreneurship using administrative data from U.S. tax returns. We find a large increase in entry to entrepreneurship, particularly for women and women with dependents. We examine the role of child care disruptions, remote-work availability, and displacement, finding support in favor of the pandemic-driven increase in child care responsibilities as a primary factor. We show that transitions are persistent and lead to higher income for women. The pandemic shifted the composition of firms in the economy toward digital retail stores. Firms started by women survive more and have higher profitability. Overall, the results indicate that the pandemic shifted individuals’ preferences toward work.

Monopolizing Minds: How M&As Stifle Innovation Through Labor Market Power

Alex Xi He, University of Maryland; Jing Xue, Georgia State University

Abstract: This paper argues that mergers and acquisitions reduce inventors’ innovation incentives and outputs by increasing firms’ labor market power and limiting the rents inventors can capture. We test this mechanism using individual-level longitudinal data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We find that, at both target and acquiring firms, inventors exposed to greater increases in labor market concentration—particularly in already-concentrated markets—produce fewer patents, earn lower wages, and exhibit reduced job mobility following mergers. In aggregate, the negative impact of increased labor market power on inventor productivity outweighs the potential benefits from innovation synergies. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role of labor market dynamics and inventor incentives in evaluating the innovation consequences of mergers and aquisitions.

Artificial Intelligence and the Labor Market

Menaka Hampole, Yale University; Dimitris Papanikolaou, Northwestern University; Lawrence D.W. Schmidt, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Bryan Seegmiller, Northwestern University

Abstract: We leverage recent advances in natural language processing to construct measures of workers’ task exposure to AI and machine learning technologies over the 2010 to 2023 period, varying across firms and time. Using a theoretical framework that allows labor-saving technology to affect worker productivity both directly and indirectly, we show that the impact on wage earnings and employment can be summarized by two statistics. First, labor demand decreases in the average exposure of workers’ tasks to AI technologies. Second, holding the average exposure constant, labor demand increases in the dispersion of task exposures to AI as workers shift effort to tasks not displaced by AI. Exploiting exogenous variation in our measures based on preexisting hiring practices across firms, we find empirical support for these predictions, together with a lower demand for skills affected by AI. Overall, we find muted effects of AI on employment due to offsetting effects: Occupations highly exposed to AI experience relatively lower demand compared to less exposed occupations, but the resulting increase in firm productivity increases overall employment across all occupations.

Gender, Race, and Online Platform Work in the U.S.: An Intersectional Analysis

Rachel Marie Brooks Atkins, St. John’s University; Quentin Brummet, NORC University of Chicago; Katie Johnson, NORC University of Chicago

Abstract: This study uses data from the Entrepreneurship in the Population Survey to measure the prevalence, earnings, and motivations for online platform work by race, gender, and their intersection. Though online platform work represents an important segment of the labor market, prior studies often fail to adequately capture its demographic nuances. Our analysis reveals gender and racial disparities in prevalence of online platform work. Earnings data show significant disparities, with women and racial minorities disproportionately concentrated in lower-income categories. White men dominate higher-earning brackets. Motivations for platform work also vary. Women frequently cite flexibility and a desire to supplement pay. Black workers pursue platform work for their primary source of income and to fulfill their entrepreneurial ambitions, while Hispanic workers emphasize career transitions and autonomy. This analysis also investigates the intersectional nature of labor market participation in the gig economy and suggest that the structural inequalities of traditional employment are mirrored, and in some cases amplified, in online platform work. Policymakers and researchers must address these disparities to ensure equity in the evolving digital labor market.

Did the Pandemic Spur the Creation of Jobs in the Transportation and Warehousing Sector that Benefitted Black Workers without College Degrees in the U.S.?

Michelle Holder, City University of New York

Abstract: The economic recovery in the United States after the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic included considerable job growth in the transportation and warehousing industrial sector: This sector gained 838,000 jobs on an annualized basis from 2019 to 2023, accounting for nearly 1 in 4 jobs added after the economy regained the total number of jobs lost during the pandemic. While the U.S. economy experienced strong job growth through 2024, the industrial mix of jobs changed after 2019; the number of jobs in transportation and warehousing grew by 11 percent from 2019 to 2023, while employment in sectors such as leisure and hospitality and retail sales remained below their pre-pandemic levels during the same time period. Given employment growth in transportation and warehousing, as well as the representation of Black workers in this sector, this research seeks to address the following three questions: Did the pandemic spur the creation of jobs in the transportation and warehousing sector jobs that benefitted Black workers, particularly those who do not possess a college degree? Did Black women benefit from this sector’s job growth, and, if not, why not? Were the jobs being created in transportation and warehousing “good” jobs, defined in this research as offering compensation that was not predominantly low-wage, as well as providing health insurance benefits, fair working conditions and full-time employment?

Effects of Fair Workweek Laws on Labor Market Outcomes

Joseph Pickens, United States Naval Academy; Aaron Sojourner, W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research

Abstract: This paper models Fair Workweek regulations that require employers to provide employees with schedule predictability (via advance notice of their work schedule and premium payments for short-notice changes) and access to hours (meaning they must offer open hours to existing employees before hiring new workers). We develop a theoretical model of employers’ responses to these provisions and their implications for employment. Guided by the model, we estimate the effects of a recently adopted Fair Workweek regulation in New York City’s fast-food sector using a synthetic difference-in-differences design. We find a null effect.

Electric Vehicle Policies in the Inflation Reduction Act: When Do Climate Provisions and Industrial Policy Goals Align?

Yongjoon Park, University of Massachusetts-Amherst; Yichen Christy Zhou, Clemson University; Joshua Linn, University of Maryland

Abstract: It is becoming increasingly common to package environmental policies with industrial policies that promote domestic manufacturing, businesses, and jobs. Recent examples include the Inflation Reduction Act’s electric vehicle tax credits in the United States and the Green Deal Industrial Policy in the European Union. These policies intend to “kill two birds with one stone,” yet these two goals may not necessarily align. This study examines whether the dual objectives of EV subsidies in the IRA—reducing greenhouse gas emissions and boosting domestic vehicle production—exhibit synergies or create conflicts. Whether these goals are complementary or create trade-offs, and whether these subsidies are efficient, crucially depends on what eligible electric vehicles replace, particularly how consumers substitute between eligible electric cars and other vehicles (e.g., other energy/fuel-efficient electric vehicles, domestically produced gasoline vehicles). To provide useful policy implications, it is crucial to obtain accurate estimates of the substitution patterns between products for the consumer. Therefore, we estimate a structural model of new vehicle demand and supply in the United States while incorporating information on production location, which we then use to simulate policy counterfactuals.

Preschool as Child Care: Head Start Duration Expansions and Maternal Employment

Chloe Gibbs, University of Notre Dame; Esra Kose, University of California, Merced; Maria Rosales-Rueda, University of Delaware

Abstract: Early childhood care and education settings serve two purposes simultaneously: supporting children’s development and early learning and facilitating parents’ gainful activities. We examine how access to full-day Head Start programs affects maternal labor supply, leveraging a recent funding eligibility rule that expanded the duration of Head Start programs. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the availability of supplemental funds to extend the duration of Head Start programming. Head Start grantees serving fewer than 40 percent of their center-based slots for a full school day and full school year were eligible to apply. Our analysis leverages this policy threshold and combines data on Head Start enrollment and center locations with parents’ employment data from the annual American Community Survey from 2008 to 2020. We first demonstrate that the 2016 funding availability significantly increased full-time Head Start enrollment. Next, using variation in access to full-day Head Start across place and time, we find that single mothers of preschool-aged children increase their labor force participation and work more hours per week. Our findings provide new evidence on the broader effects of early childhood investments on mothers’ economic opportunities.

One Giant Leap: Emancipation and Aggregate Economic Gains

Richard Hornbeck, University of Chicago; Trevon Logan, Ohio State University

Abstract: We characterize American slavery as inefficient, whereby emancipation generated substantial aggregate economic gains. Coercion distorted labor markets, raising the marginal cost of labor substantially above its marginal benefit. Production came at immense costs imposed on enslaved people that reduced aggregate economic surplus (the total value of output minus total costs incurred). Costs of enslavement are inherently difficult to quantify, which leads to a wide range of quantitative estimates from this conceptual shift, but we calculate that emancipation generated aggregate economic gains worth a 4 percent to 35 percent increase in U.S. aggregate productivity (or worth 7–60 years of technological innovation). Emancipation decreased output but decreased costs substantially more, illustrating the substantial potential for aggregate economic gains in the presence of severe sectoral misallocation.

Package of funding bills rejects draconian cuts and policies pushed by President Trump, House Republicans—and reasserts congressional control over key funding decisions

Democrats protect program to lower families’ energy bills, key investments in scientific research, and much more

Washington, D.C. — Today, top appropriators in the Senate and House released text of three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills: the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bills.

In a statement, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said:

“While President Trump has pushed to slash and even outright defund programs that help families get by, Democrats fought to protect investments that matter most to working and middle-class families in every part of the country.

“Democrats defeated heartless cuts that would have increased Americans’ costs and extreme proposals that would have jeopardized people’s safety and enshrined backwards policies in law for years to come.

“President Trump sought to raise Americans’ energy bills even more by eliminating a key savings program—but Democrats saved it and secured more funding to help lower families’ costs.

“This package rejects President Trump’s push to let our competitors do laps around us by slashing federal funding for scientific research by upwards of 50% and killing thousands of good jobs in the process. It protects essential funding for our public lands, rejects steep proposed cuts to public safety grants that keep our communities safe, and boosts funding for key flood mitigation projects.

“Importantly, passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent—by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions. It is so important we pass full-year funding bills again and refuse to cede power to this administration, and I hope that Republicans will work with us to do that as we pass the remainder of our funding bills.

“As I’ve made clear all year, Democrats stand ready to support funding bills that protect our investments in working families and the programs they count on most.”

Throughout negotiations, Democrats fought to protect the programs and investments that matter most to working families across the country.

Among much else, the three-bill package delivers important investments for the American people:

FAMILIES’ ENERGY COSTS: Rejects President Trump’s push to eliminate the Weatherization Assistance Program that saves families an average of $372 per year on their energy bills by making energy efficiency upgrades. Instead, Democrats secured a $3 million increase in funding for the program.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: Rejects President Trump’s efforts to slash funding for the National Science Foundation by 57%, gut funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science by $1.1 billion, and slash NASA’s science budget by 47%. Instead, the package sustains research funding for NSF, provides $160 million more for the Office of Science, which supports critical research being conducted by 22,000 researchers at our 17 national labs and over 300 universities, and provides $7.25 billion for NASA’s science budget.

PUBLIC LANDS & NATIONAL PARKS: Rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding for the National Park Service by over $1 billion and provides the funding necessary to fully support longstanding operations of America’s public lands.

FLOOD PREVENTION: Provides $10.44 billion for the Army Corps, a historic funding level, rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding by $2 billion, and reasserts congressional control over which projects get funded and how much funding they receive.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: Provides $7 million more for grant programs administered by the Office of Violence Against Women, rejecting President Trump’s efforts to cut over $200 million in funding for the office, which provides grants to communities nationwide to help survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: Rejects President Trump’s push to slash funding for the EPA—providing $4.7 billion above his request. Also rejects extreme riders that would enshrine detrimental policies in law.

TRIBES: Delivers essential funding to support Tribes and our treaty obligations to them—rejecting President Trump’s push to slash funding for Tribes by nearly $1 billion.

REASSERTS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL: Prevents President Trump and his cabinet secretaries from unilaterally deciding how to spend taxpayer dollars. Right now, the Trump administration has significantly more discretion to decide how to allocate federal funding thanks to Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which failed to provide detailed funding directives for hundreds of programs and turned over decision-making power to the executive branch to fill in the gaps itself. This package provides detailed directives about how funds are to be spent—just as Congress has long done when writing full-year appropriations bills—so that Congress, and not the executive branch, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.

REJECTS EXTREME REPUBLICAN RIDERS: Rejects scores of extreme riders and proposals included in House Republicans’ draft bills—and many more sought by President Trump in his budget request.

Tesla sales fell 8.6% in 2025 and the company reported a 16% decrease in fourth quarter deliveries.

BYD outsold Tesla for the calendar year as its battery electric vehicle sales increased by 28%.

Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk appears focussed on autonomous technologies above EVs, with the company launching robotaxi trials and humanoid robots

In the company’s third quarter earnings call, he said: “People just don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off… it’s going to be like a shock wave.

“We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we’re making a couple million a year.”

EV leaders through history

Based in Ohio, US, Baker Electric was the largest EV manufacturer in the world for several years in the 1900s, outselling gasoline cars in some places.

Detroit Electric also produced more than 13,000 electric vehicles, but gasoline cars became more convenient with cheap oil being widely available.

The Mitsubishi i-MiEV was the first highway-capable, mass-produced EV of the modern era in 2009.

It had a range of around 62 miles and was the only option available for around 18 months.

The Nissan Leaf launched in December 2010 and was the first electric car to cross the 100,000 and 200,000 sales milestones.

Tesla first claimed the global EV lead around 2015, surpassing the Nissan Leaf.

For most of the decade, Tesla’s main challenge was production capacity rather than demand.

As of 2026, the EV crown has moved to China where BYD is finding success in its vertical integration and a wide variety of models at different prices.

BYD has been making its lithium iron phosphate “Blade Batteries” for its own cars and other automakers since 2020.

According to Electrive, Tesla has even made use of these cells in its Model Y cars.

Tesla’s sales still rely almost entirely on the Model 3, released in 2017, and Model Y, released in 2020 with the models S, X and the Cybertruck also available.

BYD offers dozens of models across a variety of price brackets, from budget hatchbacks to luxury SUVs.

“These factors have the potential to improve both the efficiency of capacity auction outcomes and the ability of the market to meet its resource adequacy objective,” ISO-NE said.
So far, there hasn’t been significant data center development in New England, but that could change, according to the grid operator.
“Such uncertainty … demands a capacity market design that procures capacity based on the most up-to-date and accurate data regarding supply and demand dynamics,” ISO-NE said.
The proposal received broad stakeholder support and is one part of a broader capacity market reform initiative, according to the grid operator.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

ISO New England aims to overhaul its capacity auction process by buying capacity a month ahead of time instead of three years in advance, according to a proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Dec. 30.

The proposal to switch to a “prompt” capacity auction framework in June 2028 would bring a range of benefits to New England, including making its load forecasts and other key inputs used to set the auction’s parameters more accurate, according to the grid operator.

In a change from current practice, the capacity auction would only be open to existing resources.

“These factors have the potential to improve both the efficiency of capacity auction outcomes and the ability of the market to meet its resource adequacy objective,” ISO-NE said.

Partly, the proposal aims to address uncertainty about New England’s future resource needs, according to ISO-NE.

Driven by home and vehicle electrification, ISO-NE expects its reserve margin will fall from 15% in 2029 to 8% in 2034, the grid operator said. However, that forecast may be overstated after the 2025 budget bill ended federal tax credits for electric vehicles, ISO-NE said.

So far, there hasn’t been significant data center development in New England, but that could change, according to the grid operator.

“Such uncertainty … demands a capacity market design that procures capacity based on the most up-to-date and accurate data regarding supply and demand dynamics,” ISO-NE said.

The proposal also calls for changing ISO-NE’s process for considering power plant retirements. Currently, power plant owners can retire a resource only by submitting a “de-list bid” into the capacity auction four years ahead of a planned retirement. ISO-NE plans to replace that process with a one-year advance notification requirement.

“The reforms to the capacity resource deactivation process will facilitate capacity suppliers’ use of more accurate information about resource and economic conditions before deciding upon whether to proceed with a deactivation — and will also improve the flexibility of deactivated resources to return to the market if conditions so warrant,” ISO-NE said.

The proposal received broad stakeholder support and is one part of a broader capacity market reform initiative, according to the grid operator.

ISO-NE is working with its stakeholders to develop a winter and summer seasonal capacity auction framework instead of its existing annual construct, which sends a price signal reflecting summer peak demand, the grid operator said.

“This will allow the capacity market to send a price signal that reflects the value of resources toward meeting winter demand, as it increases, which, in turn, will provide capacity suppliers with the incentive to ensure resources are capable of performing to meet that demand, by (for example) shoring up fuel supplies and/or installing dual fuel capability,” ISO-NE said.

In the same proposal — set to be filed late this year at FERC — ISO-NE plans to replace its existing summer performance-based capacity accreditation process with requirements that capture the marginal reliability contribution of resources during high reliability risk periods, the grid operator said.

Tesla Inc. ceded the title of world’s top seller of electric cars to China’s BYD Co., squandering a lead the Elon Musk-led company built as it popularized plug-in vehicles over the past decade.

The U.S. automaker reported a 16% decline in fourth-quarter deliveries, trailing analyst estimates. For the year, Tesla sales slid almost 9%, its second consecutive annual drop.

BYD, by contrast, increased battery-electric vehicle sales both for the quarter and the full year, delivering almost 2.26 million EVs in 2025 to Tesla’s 1.64 million.

Investors have paid little mind of late to Tesla’s decline in the global EV pecking order, with Musk prioritizing artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The CEO has drawn attention away from Tesla’s core business by touting progress in his long-standing effort to start a robotaxi service.

Standing up those operations will be crucial in 2026 given the outlook for EV demand in the U.S., Tesla’s largest market. President Donald Trump’s administration has ceased federal incentives supporting plug-in vehicle purchases and hollowed out fuel economy and emissions regulations that had generated billions of dollars in revenue for the company.

“Deliveries barely matter anymore,” Alexander Potter, an analyst with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, said in a note Jan. 2. Instead, the performance of Tesla’s shares in 2026 “should be driven by progress in AI and robotics.”

AI Emphasis

Wall Street had been bracing for a “hangover” for Tesla after tax credits for EV purchases ended in the US, William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note. He similarly posited that the company “is valued almost entirely on the transformation to real-world AI.”

BYD pulled away from Tesla last year after coming up just shy of the world leader in 2024. While the Chinese manufacturer delivered more fully electric cars in the fourth quarter of that year, Tesla maintained a slim lead on an annual basis.

In addition to selling far more EVs in China — where some of its cars are far cheaper than Tesla’s most affordable vehicle, the Model 3 — BYD has been surging in Europe.

Through the first 11 months of last year, BYD registered more cars than Tesla in both Germany and the U.K., the region’s two biggest EV markets. Tesla’s sales across Europe fell 28% during that span, and the company posted steep December declines in France, Spain and Sweden.

2026 Outlook

Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical about Tesla’s 2026 sales prospects. This time two years ago, analysts were predicting Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles. The average estimate has plunged to around 1.8 million.

Tesla’s energy storage battery business, on the other hand, has never been stronger.

The company deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of energy storage products last quarter, up from the 11 gigawatt hours a year earlier. Total deployments for the year jumped almost 50% to 46.7 gigawatt hours.

“The sustained growth of energy storage reflects structural tailwinds from AI-driven electricity demand, which is driving incremental storage requirements to support data center buildouts and power grid stabilization,” Tom Narayan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock, said in a note.

Tesla ended last year by building anticipation for Cybercab, a two-seat compact car with butterfly doors. While prototypes have lacked a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm told Bloomberg News in October that the company will sell the car with those components if required by regulators.

While Tesla began driverless testing with Model Ys in Austin late last month, consumers thus far are only able to summon rides from small numbers of cars in the Texas capital and the San Francisco Bay area with safety supervisors in the front seats.

For his part, Musk is optimistic about the year ahead.

Leveraging this capability, Hyundai Steel plans to intensively test hydrogen-based direct reduction methods, which are seen as a cornerstone technology for future low-emission steel production.
The Dangjin pilot facility will be approximately one-hundredth the scale of the equipment to be installed in Louisiana.","Hyundai Steel has announced plans to construct a pilot-scale facility for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI) at its Dangjin Steelworks, located in South Chungcheong Province. The move is aimed at accelerating the company’s transition toward low-carbon steelmaking and supporting preparations for a major steel mill project in the United States. DRI is produced by chemically removing oxygen from iron ore in a solid state, without melting the ore, making it a cleaner alternative to traditional blast furnace ironmaking.

According to sources within the steel industry, construction of the DRI pilot facility at Dangjin Steelworks has already begun. The pilot unit is designed to manufacture approximately 30 kilograms of reduced iron per hour. Hyundai Steel intends to commence trial operations of the facility next year, using it to test and refine multiple DRI production processes. Insights gained from these trials will be applied directly to the design, construction, and early-stage operation of its upcoming steel mill in Louisiana.

DRI technology relies on natural gas or hydrogen as reducing agents to strip oxygen from iron ore pellets. Compared with conventional blast furnace routes, the process can deliver iron with similarly high purity while significantly lowering carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, DRI-based steelmaking generally requires lower capital expenditure, making it an increasingly attractive option as steelmakers worldwide respond to tightening environmental regulations and decarbonization targets.

Hyundai Steel selected Dangjin as the location for the pilot facility because the site already hosts a hydrogen production plant that has been operating since 2016. The Dangjin hydrogen facility produces ultra-high-purity hydrogen at 99.999%, exceeding the typical 99.99% purity level achieved by many other hydrogen plants. Leveraging this capability, Hyundai Steel plans to intensively test hydrogen-based direct reduction methods, which are seen as a cornerstone technology for future low-emission steel production.

The large-scale steel mill planned for Louisiana, which is scheduled to break ground this year, will also employ the DRI process. With an investment of approximately $5.8 billion, the project is positioned as the world’s first fully integrated electric-arc-furnace steel mill of its kind. Once operational, the Louisiana facility is expected to produce around 2.7 million tons of steel products annually, primarily serving regional automotive manufacturers such as Hyundai Motor, Kia, Ford, and General Motors.

At the U.S. site, Hyundai Steel plans to construct a massive DRI reactor tower rising roughly 100 meters in height. In this unit, iron ore pellets—made by compressing and firing iron ore fines into spherical shapes—will react with reducing gases to produce DRI. Compared with traditional blast furnaces, which rely on carbon monoxide generated from coke, the DRI route can reduce carbon emissions by as much as 70%.

The Dangjin pilot facility will be approximately one-hundredth the scale of the equipment to be installed in Louisiana. Despite its smaller size, it will play a critical role in gathering operational data, including the cost and efficiency of reducing agent inputs, process stability, and methods for capturing and managing exhaust gases. By analyzing this data, Hyundai Steel aims to shorten the ramp-up period for stable operations at the Louisiana mill and ensure the consistent production of high-grade automotive steel sheets.

To support this expansion, Hyundai Steel last year doubled the size of its North American business division, which is responsible for overseeing the Louisiana project. The company has also strengthened its low-carbon technology office by increasing staffing levels to accelerate development of hydrogen-based reduction technologies.

A company official explained that the decision to build the Dangjin pilot facility was driven by the need to secure first-phase DRI production technologies and establish standardized manufacturing processes for the Louisiana mill. The official added that identifying potential technical challenges in advance will allow Hyundai Steel to prepare mitigation strategies and stabilize large-scale operations in the U.S. as quickly as possible.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-05 11:02:55.142127

Solar adoption in the U.S. has become the fastest-growing source of power in the country. In 2024, 84% of all new electricity generation capacity added to the grid came from solar and storage, with the number of solar installations surpassing five million.

However, this momentum is expected to slow down under the current administration’s executive order and funding cuts, which limit federal solar tax credits and set ambitious deadlines for eligibility. Still, many states are choosing to expand grants and rebates, and streamline permitting, showing that regional leadership can still guide renewable growth.

It’s become a push-and-pull best described as one step forward and two steps back. But if you take a closer look, many of the existing incentives and policies that ignited the initial “boom” were already misdirected. Research shows that most solar installations are concentrated in wealthier communities, while low-income households, those who would stand to benefit the most, remain largely excluded.

Globally, countries like China and Brazil have shown that solar can do more than decarbonize; it can also help alleviate poverty. In the U.S., there is a real opportunity to do the same, even in the midst of federal pullbacks on funding that was dedicated to addressing this exact issue.

We know capital alone won’t solve the problem. To expand solar equitably, agencies need to coordinate policies that remove barriers, empower local leadership, and innovative tools that support developments that can be shared equally.

With a narrow window of opportunity to change how solar is installed across the country in 2026, let’s take a closer look at the story.

From a commercial perspective, solar developers need to target residential demographics with an interest in renewable energy and the capital to invest in solar rooftop installations. Rooftop solar panels and installation have a median cost of around $30,000 before government incentives, pricing many households out of the equation.

In short, current deployment models overlook high-potential, underserved communities.

A study from Cornell University supports this, with data showing that rooftop solar installations are concentrated in particular regions, such as California, and demographics, such as high-income Asian neighborhoods. The researchers also found that lower-income neighborhoods have 14.7% higher carbon offset potential but 47% fewer installations.

The irony of the situation is that the households without solar rooftop installations are the ones who would benefit most from the resource.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, low-income households spend an average of 8.6% of their income on energy costs, compared to around 3% for non-low-income households.

Switching to solar isn’t only about reducing our reliance on fossil fuels but tackling poverty from the ground up. Without rising costs of living and stagnant wages, solar energy offers a way for homes to cover their immediate electricity needs and reduce utility bills by selling power back to the grid for credits.

However, many households have insufficient cash resources to pay for the installation upfront. Other common barriers to entry for solar technology include a lack of financing due to poor or non-existent credit, inadequate installation conditions on the property, and limited access to reliable, trustworthy solar installers.

If we’re to address the unequal access to solar for the households who are most in need, these barriers to entry must be tackled across the U.S.

Flipping the scales with subsidies, policy and innovation

There are a handful of programs run through state governments that are designed to lower these barriers to entry for solar, in the form of tax credits and rebates.

An example is California, which offers a range of options that include no-cost rooftop solar installations or discounted offerings on energy usage. What’s unique about their Disadvantaged Communities - Single-family Solar Homes program is that it’s one of the few that covers full costs for qualifying owners, rather than just partial subsidies.

Further, many low-income households are renting or lack direct access to a rooftop. Community solar is a key way to address uptake for communities that fall into these brackets by allowing customers to tap into solar generated at a shared site, like a solar farm. In turn, they receive monthly credits for the share of solar they help “produce,” to reduce their overall utility bills.

Many states leveraged the federal government’s ¨Solar for All¨ $7 billion grant initially offered during the previous administration to support lower-income households’ solar transitions across the country, but were forced to cancel after the Environmental Protection Agency formally terminated the program in August. The decision has since sparked a lawsuit from several solar installation companies and advocacy groups challenging the EPA’s decision, alleging it is unconstitutional.

In response, Massachusetts moved ahead with its own plan, launching the redesigned Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target 3.0 program, without relying on federal funding. The updated framework continues to incentivize solar and sets new equity requirements for community projects. The state has positioned itself as one of the few looking to maintain momentum on renewable energy despite shifting national policies.

Even with costs covered, lingering distrust remains a barrier. Studies show that many low-income households don’t differentiate between solar providers from energy service companies, which have a history of using sales tactics that disproportionately impact marginalized communities. With unexpected rate increases and unclear billing, it’s no surprise that homeowners remain cautious about new energy options.

So while subsidies can address one barrier, community-led promotions and education strategies that clearly communicate the benefits that solar will bring by reducing utility bills need to be prioritized in order to have a far-reaching impact, distinct from sales-driven language that can reinforce skepticism.

Aside from tackling inequalities and poverty, rooftop solar is also key to the future of how cities are imagining a relationship between renewable energy and space. It’s part of how cities rethink the use of existing space but integrating solar into the built environment. For example, across Northern New Jersey, there are roughly 50,000 commercial rooftops and nearly 14 GW of untapped potential that can power everything from schools to public housing, without having to seek permits for additional land use.

The next phase of progress will be driven by valuable data that today’s technology can provide access to. Tools like GeoAI and satellite-based modeling can help developers and communities easily identify the rooftop solar potential, analyzing sunlight exposure, specifically in low-income neighborhoods. Pairing this data with local engagement helps direct public funding to the places that need it most, making solar development not just faster, but also equitable and more strategic.

A cleaner future has become much more achievable if the path forward merges innovation with inclusion. By combining advanced mapping tools that tell a story through data, transparent community outreach, and equitable funding models, stakeholders can easily turn existing infrastructure into renewable energy assets that support a range of communities.

The challenge ahead isn’t about whether solar can work, but how quickly it can align policy, technology, and trust to make it work for everyone.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6QkuBF0C1NpkiLdzNEr4o4oZw--c1qy_XrT6l6O9Ddk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8xXy1fVGhlX0JlYWNoX1NvbGFyX1BhbmVsX0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-05 10:13:52.218871

Now, Amador has become an evangelist for something that can provide a modest measure of relief: a community solar project, built on a Superfund site too polluted for much else in the city of Waukegan where he lives, about 40 miles north of Chicago.

Residents who subscribe to get energy from the solar farm are guaranteed to see savings on their energy bills, under a state program incentivizing solar in low-income areas.

The 9.1-megawatt Yeoman Solar Project, which went online last month, can provide energy for about 1,000 households, as well as the Waukegan school district, which owns the land.

The school district bought the site in the 1950s hoping to build a new high school. But the land proved too swampy, and from 1958 to 1969 it was used as a dump for industrial and municipal waste. The highly contaminated Yeoman Creek Landfill was finally cleaned up 20 years ago, and now the district receives lease payments from CleanCapital, the national solar-investment company that owns and operates the solar farm.

Such brownfields are attractive locations for solar installations because of ​“existing electrical infrastructure, lower-cost land, and community acceptance,” noted Paul Curran, CleanCapital’s chief development officer. Incentives from the state initiative Illinois Solar for All helped make the project financially viable, even given extra costs incurred from building on a Superfund site.

It’s an example of how state policy can drive clean energy development and cost savings, even as federal tax credits for solar are being cut. The project also shows how solar can turn a community liability into an asset.

“The Yeoman Solar Project encapsulates so much of solar’s promise,” said Andrew Linhares, senior manager for the central U.S. at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. ​“The project instills new life into the Yeoman Creek Landfill Superfund site like only solar can.”

Building on pollution

As an unlined pit amid wetlands, the Yeoman Creek Landfill leached toxic chemicals into the environment, including its namesake creek. In 1989, the landfill was added to the Superfund list, the federal program that requires companies responsible for pollution to clean it up.

The remediation was completed in 2005, though gas release, groundwater, and sediment are still being monitored.

“Since then, it’s been vacant,” and discussions started in 2012 regarding the fate of the land, said LeBaron Moten, deputy superintendent of Waukegan Community Unit School District No. 60.

“There were not too many options on the table for this specific site. We couldn’t build anything on it,” Moten said. ​“Our main objective was to keep people off it.”

Representatives of the school district, the city, and the group of companies involved in the cleanup decided to pursue putting a solar farm on the site, and in 2017 the school district issued a request for proposals. A national developer experienced in building solar on landfills, BQ Energy, was selected. In 2022, it was acquired by CleanCapital, which launched construction of the project.

Moten said the lease payments from CleanCapital and the energy savings from solar power will be helpful for the district, which serves over 13,000 students, the majority of whom are Latino and 68% of whom are considered low-income. The school district will be the project’s anchor tenant, using about 40% of the energy produced.

Seven of the school district’s buildings have rooftop solar arrays, which are referenced in sustainability lessons in the classroom. Moten said he hopes Yeoman Solar will similarly factor into educating students about clean energy, and potentially preparing them for jobs in the industry.

A new direction brings new challenges

A longtime industrial hub, Waukegan is home to five Superfund sites. The city still has a lot of manufacturing, and until 2022 a large coal plant operated on the shore of Lake Michigan, not far from residents’ homes. That location remains contaminated with toxic coal ash. The community organization Clean Power Lake County and local activists have long demanded a just transition for Waukegan, in which economic opportunities and renewable energy benefit residents who have suffered from pollution.

Installing solar on brownfields is one way to accomplish this.

Solar is a good fit for sites that are too polluted for housing or other types of development, noted Curran. Under the terms of the Superfund remediation, residential use is prohibited at the Yeoman Creek site.

But installing arrays on landfills or other remediated areas does entail some challenges.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reviews solar developers’ plans for Superfund sites, Curran said, to be sure the construction won’t damage caps over contaminated soil or otherwise release pollutants. The EPA examines ​“every single step of construction from how big ballasts can be, to stormwater protection, to how we’re going to revegetate,” he added.

Even mowing the grass below solar panels — a normally mundane process — can pose risks when a landfill lies underneath.

“The lawn is basically what’s holding the land in place, so you don’t get erosion,” Curran said.

An Illinois law passed in October and awaiting the governor’s signature creates a rebate for community solar paired with battery storage. Curran said that batteries would likely be too heavy to locate on a landfill, but CleanCapital may explore putting them on firmer ground nearby.

The company has developed solar on brownfields and landfills in other states, including a new 822-kilowatt site in Maryland. Curran said community solar should be built on more of the nation’s thousands of closed landfills.

Policies like those in Illinois help facilitate the process. A 2017 law created robust incentives for community solar. Since then, more than 700 community solar projects totaling over 1,800 megawatts have been built through the Illinois Shines incentive program. Another 33 projects representing 64 megawatts have been subsidized by Illinois Solar for All, a program for low-income and environmental justice areas (separate from the federal program of the same name that was ended by the Trump administration).

The Illinois Power Agency, which acquires power on behalf of utilities, procures solar built on brownfields. The Illinois EPA also provides low-interest loans and other resources for brownfield redevelopment.

A shared resource

Amador found out about Yeoman Solar from local clean energy leaders after he helped launch a Waukegan branch of the Chicago Workers Collaborative, which organizes and advocates for temporary workers. (He is no longer with the group, though he still lives in Waukegan.)

Community solar makes clean energy accessible to people who can’t or don’t want to install solar on their own homes — like Amador himself.

“I live in a condo building, and if I bought a house I probably would not have solar panels. I don’t like how they look on rooftops,” he said.

He often gets the same reaction when he tells people about community solar. ​“At first they think I’m talking about installing solar on their homes — they don’t want that.”

But after explaining and extolling the community solar model, Amador has recruited dozens of family, friends, and members of his church to subscribe to Yeoman Solar.

“It will help their wallet and help the ecosystem too,” Amador said.

The Yeoman Solar subscriptions will cover more than 90% of a household’s energy needs, said Ryan Libby, director of subscriber acquisition for PowerMarket, which CleanCapital contracted to recruit subscribers. Amador expects to save about $300 a year through his subscription, which equates to about 5 kilowatts of solar panels.

“All the pollution, the coal plant, the disinvestment — communities like Waukegan should be prioritized for projects like this,” he said. ​“I’d like to encourage people to ask questions — go to meetings, find out how these projects work, try to sign up. That will help them to save some money, and if we all participate, we’re stronger.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Waukegan-ribbon-cutting_2025-12-23-224618_wvlt.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=6387c1a2bf63f21853511ef01b10abd6,N,,2026-01-05 14:14:27.625897

Coal plants slated for closure were ordered to continue running in the name of grid reliability, while the construction of wind projects was halted because of national security.

The moves infuriated the president’s critics, who claimed Trump is using his emergency authority to aid his favored fuel (coal) and hurt technologies he dislikes (wind). But Trump and administration officials defiantly argued the measures were needed to correct policy interventions by the Biden administration that helped renewables, jeopardized reliability and sent power prices climbing.

The debate underscores how much has changed during Trump’s first year in office. While presidents of both parties have expanded executive power in recent decades, Trump has taken the exercise to new limits. The result is a fundamentally changed energy landscape. Plodding rules and regulations that governed the country’s collection of electricity markets have taken a backseat to Trump’s sweeping executive orders that determine which power plants get built and which ones will shut down. The implications for grid reliability, electricity prices and the planet remain uncertain.

“The way decisions are getting made are very fast paced and not sort of done in a more methodical, comprehensive, strategic approach,” said Devin Hartman, who directs energy policy at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank that has been critical of Trump’s use of emergency powers. “It’s a lot more just one off, what can we quickly do on this as soon as possible to have the most effect and less concerned with procedural considerations, or in some cases, legal questions.”

He added, “It’s just a very different way to approach policy.”

That was on display in the closing weeks of 2025, as the Department of Energy issued orders to keep four retiring coal facilities open, and the Interior Department halted construction of five offshore wind projects. In both cases, the administration cited the emergency powers of the presidency.

DOE invoked a provision of the Federal Power Act known as 202(c) that allows it to direct power plant operators to run a facility for 90-days in the event of an emergency, arguing the coal facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability at a time of mounting electricity demand.

The department ordered a Washington state coal plant to stay open on Dec. 16. It followed up with a similar order for two Indiana coal plants on Dec. 23. On Christmas Day, DOE tweeted a picture of Santa Claus holding a satchel of coal with the caption “coal isn’t just for the naughty this year.” Then, on Dec. 30, it ordered a turbine at a Colorado coal plant to stay open.

Coal supporters cheered the orders.

“Maintaining a diverse set of fuel resources, including coal, is critical to ensuring electric reliability, especially during winter storms and other extreme weather events,” said Michelle Bloodworth, who leads the coal trade group America’s Power. “The Department of Energy’s actions to keep these coal units online will help assure that the lights stay on for millions of people this winter.”

DOE did not respond to a request for comment. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright said when announcing the move to keep the turbine open at Craig Generating Station in Colorado that the decision was necessary to ensure “an affordable, reliable, and secure supply of electricity.”

The order came just days after Craig’s 446-megawatt turbine suffered a mechanical breakdown. State leaders said Colorado was being targeted by Trump, who had recently attacked Gov. Jared Polis (D) as a “bad governor.”

The flurry of actions to aid coal came as Interior officials announced they had received a classified Department of Defense report showing that radar interference by wind turbines is a threat to national security. The order that followed halted work on five projects under construction along the East Coast for 90 days.

The move marked a sharp escalation for a president who has made opposition to wind a hallmark of his second term. On Friday, Trump posted three times on his social media site about the dangers that wind turbines pose to eagles. He made no mention of Interior’s order.

Interior previously proposed revoking permits for projects that had yet to start construction. It also ordered two projects to temporarily stop construction earlier in 2025. The department stepped back both times, once because Trump claimed to strike a deal with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) and another time because the order was reversed by a federal judge.

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said Trump’s actions were necessary to correct Biden-era policies aimed at shutting down coal facilities. “That is why he declared a national energy emergency on day one and unleashed reliable, affordable energy sources that will ultimately safeguard our economic and national security,” she wrote in an email.

Trump’s aggressive approach represents a departure from his first term, when administration officials considered the use of emergency statutes but followed traditional policy-making channels.

In one high profile instance, the Energy Department proposed subsidizing coal and nuclear plants in 2018, citing national security as the rationale. The plan was unanimously rejected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. DOE and the White House later debated invoking national security statutes to implement the plan but ultimately decided against it due to internal worries about its costs.

Trump showed no such hesitancy in 2025. DOE invoked its 202(c) emergency authority more times during the last year than any previous administration over a four-year term, according to a tally by ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm.

‘Bad sources’

Trump isn’t the first president to push the bounds of executive power to achieve his political goals, said David Spence, who specializes in natural resource law at the University of Texas, Austin, School of Law. But Trump has been “unusually willing to test the law or to sort of violate the law and then hope that the courts validate it or ratify it after the fact,” Spence said.

Critics argue that it’s hypocritical to block some power plants from being built at a time when the Trump administration is asserting national security reasons to keep others open. The five offshore wind projects under construction would generate enough electricity to supply 2.7 million homes.

One of those projects, Vineyard Wind, is already sending electricity to New England’s power grid. Another, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, is the country’s largest marine wind project at 2.6 gigawatts. It would contribute energy to Virginia, which is seeing electricity demand rise quickly due to mounting power consumption from data centers.

“If we have a reliability crisis, we need everything to get on the system immediately. And if we don’t have a reliability crisis, we don’t need to take a bunch of coal-fired power plants out of the market and prohibit them from retiring,” said Joshua Macey, a professor at Yale Law School who has been critical of the administration’s use of emergency authority.

Trump has expanded the definition of what constitutes an emergency, he said. DOE traditionally used its emergency authority to respond to natural disasters or blackouts observed during California’s energy crisis in 2000 — not for potential risks about grid reliability.

“The kind of crisis the administration is pointing to looks categorically different from every single use of the 202(c) in the past,” Macey said.

Ordering coal plants to stay open while halting wind projects might appear contradictory, but it fits with the Trump administration’s wider view that renewables negatively impact grid reliability and electricity prices, said Timothy Fox, an analyst who tracks electricity policy at ClearView Energy.

“The Trump Administration takes the position that incremental renewables do not equate to incremental generation capacity, because more solar and wind can push out conventional generation, notwithstanding rising power demand,” he wrote in an email.

That type of thinking points to a flaw in the Trump administration’s approach, said Hartman, the R Street analyst. He said administration officials were getting “information from bad sources” about the impact of renewables on the grid. While wind and solar projects do not contribute to reliability to the same degree as natural gas or nuclear plants, the electricity they do generate is a positive for the electric system, he said.

Hartman said he was sympathetic to the administration’s concerns about maintaining grid reliability, but not its use of emergency authority to achieve its goals. It’s a response to the Biden administration’s effort to favor renewables while curtailing fossil fuel production, he said.

“That put the political right in the position to counteract those things, unfortunately, more by picking their own winners and losers to contradict the left,” Hartman said. “We kind of need this adult conversation, actually, about the fuel wars and saying: ‘This is not benefiting anybody, you guys. This is not going to help affordability, reliability or the environment to just constantly have the seesaw of picking winners and losers.’”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/89/eb/caa58f12458fa6b6e39c8cf6eecf/trump-us-venezuela-02512.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 10:13:56.522381

These huge investors together with central banks notched a record $60 trillion in assets under management last year, the report from Global SWF showed, with sovereign wealth funds accounting for two-thirds of the money invested in the U.S. during the year.

“There was a change in paradigm when it comes to recipient countries,” Global SWF managing director Diego Lopez wrote in the report, adding that the world’s largest economy benefited from spending focused on digital infrastructure, data centres and AI companies.

Sovereign wealth fund assets alone hit a fresh record – $15 trillion – according to the report, which uses a combination of public data and official reports to monitor the assets and spending of the world’s state-owned investors, including wealth and pension funds and central banks.

Overall, sovereign wealth fund investments grew by 35% to $179.3 billion.

Emerging market slide

Funneling investments to the U.S. came at the expense of emerging markets, however – despite their outsized performance in 2025.

“The big losers were emerging markets, especially China, India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia, which received in 2025 disappointing levels of investment: a 28% drop from 2024, and only 15% of the total,” Lopez wrote.

Private credit investors by contrast have begun a pivot to emerging markets, seeking stronger returns and more advantageous project structures, the report showed.

All 11 new sovereign funds launched during the year originated in emerging markets, but with crude oil prices under pressure, 2026 could bring change for the current big spenders. Saudi Arabia already has plans to refocus spending amid low oil prices and delays to flagship projects.

“New capital will depend on the source of revenue: SWFs reliant on oil will find 2026 another tough year as revenues stagnate, while natural gas and metals such as copper spur new flows,” Lopez wrote.

US retains pulling power

The investment flow figures, Lopez noted, do not include the estimated $2.2 trillion of Magnificent 7 stocks – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla – that sovereign wealth and pension funds already hold.

The shift to the U.S. underscores its pulling power, even as investors sought to diversify as President Donald Trump reshapes the economy.

It also comes after eye-watering pledges from Gulf countries to invest billions in the United States – often through their powerful sovereign wealth funds.

Saudi Arabia was Trump’s first foreign visit during his second term, and he hosted influential Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House in November. Trump said Saudi Arabia had agreed to invest $600 billion in the U.S., while bin Salman pledged to increase the total to $1 trillion.

Abu Dhabi has pledged $1.4 trillion for U.S. investments, while Qatar plans $500 billion over the next decade.

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) with $36.2 billion committed, of which 80% will go to its takeover of games maker Electronic Arts, and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala, with a record $32.7 billion, were the top two spenders.

Gulf funds PIF, Abu Dhabi-based L’imad Holding Company PJSC, Qatar Investment Authority are also key financial backers of Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid to take over Warner Bros Discovery.

Marion, Indiana Facility Anchors Scalable Platform for Heavy Rare Earths, Defense Minerals, and Magnet Supply Chains

FISHERS, IN / ACCESS Newswire / January 5, 2026 / American Resources Corporation (NASDAQ:AREC) (""American Resources"") through its minority holding in ReElement Technologies Corporation (""ReElement"" or the ""Company""), a leading U.S. innovator in rare earth element (REE) and critical mineral refining for the commercial and defense industries, today announced the closing of a $200 million strategic equity facility from Transition Equity Partners, LLC (TEP).

This investment will accelerate the commercial deployment of ReElement's proprietary, multi-mineral refining platform, with an initial focus on the buildout of the Company's Marion, Indiana facility to meet near-term domestic demand. From this foundation, ReElement and TEP plan to strategically develop additional facilities across the United States and select international markets. Leveraging its versatile and modularly scalable refining architecture and proprietary chromatographic separation processes, the Marion site will focus on processing light rare earths, heavy rare earths and other critical defense elements. With TEP's support, the Marion facility will scale to an initial capacity greater than 10,000 metric tons per annum (MTPA) of refined critical minerals production sourced from recycled feedstocks, and mined mixed rare earth concentrates, with an ability to further scale in Marion and several other strategic locations.

ReElement is developing large-scale critical mineral processing and refining capacity to strengthen strategic United States supply chains. This includes the Company's recently announced partnership with the U.S. Department of War and Vulcan Elements to support a fully vertically integrated, domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. ReElement is also partnering with POSCO International Corporation, a global leader in steel, magnetic materials, and advanced industrial solutions, to further reinforce U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.

Beyond magnet supply chains, ReElement's proprietary chromatographic refining platform is uniquely capable of meeting demand for heavy rare earth elements and other critical defense materials that are not currently produced at scale in the United States. These include yttrium, gadolinium, germanium, antimony, terbium, dysprosium, and other essential minerals that underpin U.S. energy, advanced technology, and defense applications - and that remain subject to severe supply constraints and export controls from China.

Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies stated, ""We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners. Throughout this process, it became clear that we are closely aligned culturally and mission-wise - an alignment we believe is essential to addressing supply-chain challenges quickly while building long-term shareholder value. The $200 million commitment will enable ReElement to expand its manufacturing base initially in the United States and, over time, globally, to process and refine critical minerals and rare earth elements through a cost-competitive, modular, and scalable platform. TEP's global reach and experienced advisory network are also supporting ReElement's international expansion across Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). TEP is more than an equity sponsor; they are a strategic partner actively supporting ReElement's global growth.""

""TEP is committed and equally excited to partner with ReElement, Mark Jensen and his leading management team to help fortify the U.S. supply chain for critical energy and strategic infrastructure"" said Pat Eilers, Managing Partner and Founder of TEP, ""ReElement's uniquely superior processing platform enables the U.S. to leverage numerous domestic and ally feedstocks to bolster a diverse set of critical mineral supply chains that are essential for a strong U.S. economy. This capability is further supported by ReElement's collaboration with the U.S. government, and ability to ensure access to critical minerals necessary for energy dominance, AI leadership, strategic defense industries, among numerous other U.S. priorities. We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.""

Leveraging this strategic commitment, ReElement is positioned to play a critical role in securing U.S. and allied supply chains by delivering high-purity critical minerals at costs competitive with global markets. The Company's refining platform represents a new model for domestic and allied-nation processing - one that can be deployed rapidly, occupies a fraction of the footprint of traditional refineries, and produces ultra-high-purity outputs with significantly reduced environmental impact.

ReElement's modular approach enables rapid deployment across the United States and allied jurisdictions, co-location with mining or concentration assets, lower capital and operating costs, and cleaner, solvent-free processing compatible with U.S. environmental standards. Together, these advantages position ReElement to accelerate supply-chain resilience while supporting long-term industrial competitiveness, national security, and sustainable growth.

The model accounts for different types of wind and marine hydrokinetic technologies, the best location for co-siting these technologies, and the best size of the relevant technologies.

“Offshore energy technologies – such as marine hydrokinetic devices that convert the the ocean’s tides, current and waves into electricity – hold tremendous potential for producing sustainable energy at a reasonable cost,” says Anderson de Queiroz, co-author of a paper on the work and an associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at North Carolina State University. “We also know that putting wind turbines and marine hydrokinetic devices in the same location makes it possible to ensure a reliable flow of energy from offshore sites.

“However, the initial cost of building these offshore sites is considerable, so it is important for utilities to know that a project is going to maximize the return on their investment,” de Queiroz says. “That’s where our work comes in.”

The researchers have developed a model called a portfolio optimization framework. If a utility is considering a range of possible locations for an offshore power facility, the model can determine not only which location is best suited for maximizing energy output, but which combination of wind and hydrokinetic technologies would be able to make the most of that location. The model demonstrated in this paper focused on the use of wind turbines and marine hydrokinetic kites.

“Kites are a subset of hydrokinetic devices that use underwater sails to spin turbines, generating electricity from the movement of the ocean,” de Queiroz says. “However, the model can be modified to account for a range of other marine hydrokinetic technologies.”

To demonstrate the potential of their portfolio optimization framework, the researchers conducted a case study focusing on coastal North Carolina. The case study drew on a wide range of data, covering variables such as windspeeds, ocean currents, the depth of each location, distance from shore, and so on.

“We found that location makes a tremendous difference,” de Queiroz says. “Some places work well for wind turbines, but not for kites; other places work well for kites, but not for turbines.

“But when you find a location that works for both turbines and kites, there are two significant benefits,” de Queiroz says. “First, the cost of energy generation goes down significantly. Second, the stability of energy production goes up – the turbines offset periods when hydrokinetic energy production goes down, and the hydrokinetic devices offset periods when wind production goes down. It really underscores the difference our model can make in terms of maximizing investment in offshore power.

“We’re open to working with the energy sector to help them explore how they might use the model to inform long-term planning decisions related to sustainability and energy security,” says de Queiroz.

Researchers at Grand Valley State University and Michigan State University are collaborating to find out if a “bubble barrier” would effectively collect trash in the Grand River.

A bubble barrier is a perforated rubber tube placed diagonally across the bottom of a waterway. A compressor pumps air through the tube, creating a curtain of bubbles with an upward current that pushes garbage to the surface. Once it’s at the surface, the flow of the water directs trash into a catchment system.

There’s currently three bubble barriers installed in the Netherlands and one in Portugal, and more projects are planned throughout Europe—and now Lansing. The first was installed in 2019 in Amsterdam.

According to The Great Bubble Barrier, the company that developed the technology, these systems “have a catch rate of 86% of the floating plastic pollution in a waterway” and can capture plastics as small as one millimeter to as large as one meter.

The bubble barrier in Amsterdam catches nearly 180 pounds of trash every month, the website said.

That includes some microplastics, which range from five millimeters—about the size of a pencil eraser—to one nanometer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. A nanometer is smaller than a strand of DNA.

If installed, MSU researchers would remove plastic and other trash from the catchment location and study it.

“The thing with microplastics, especially in the water, is that just a lot around it isn't known, like the size of the plastic, its makeup, the polymer type, even where it's coming from,” researcher Ellie Sibula said. “It's assumed it's a lot of food packaging, but we don't actually know.”

Sibula is a technical aide for the MSU Water Alliance, which is one of the research groups finding out if a bubble barrier would work in the Grand River.

They’ve begun tracking how the Grand River’s seasonal patterns will affect the bubble barrier like how flow rates and water levels change each season and year-to-year variability like droughts.

“If we want this project to be long lasting, and the barrier itself like to be able to work under all these different instances, we need to make sure we're characterizing those well so we can anticipate, like, if a drought happens, it's still able to collect everything. If the water level is higher, it's still able to collect,” Sibula said.

The group has also begun characterizing plastic they suspect the barrier will collect. In the fall, they went out with volunteers to clean up the Grand River and brought some of that trash back to the lab for analysis.

Sibula said there’s been talk of the barrier installation happening this summer, but that timeline isn’t definite. It depends on what they find in the preliminary studies, if grant applications need to be changed and how much money is available.

“This is all to preemptively begin understanding the potential effectiveness of the bubble barrier so we're not wasting money in installing it,” Sibula said.

Grand Valley’s Annis Water Resources Institute is studying how the project could affect the Grand River’s ecology.

They’re doing this by analyzing the water quality, health of little plants and animals called phytoplankton and zooplankton and sediment chemistry at the bottom of the river, said Al Steinman.

Steinman is currently a research professor at the institute but was the director for more than two decades.

“It's possible – we don't know for sure – that as the agitation from the bubbles comes, the sediment will get stirred up,” Steinman said. “Given where it is in Lansing and the Grand River, it's possible there might be some legacy metals and heavy metals and some other nasty stuff in the sediment.”

Residents don’t need to worry about direct health effects from this potential sediment stirring, he said. Toxins wouldn’t get into drinking water.

But it means existing toxins could impact more fish than it already does.

Steinman said a lot of the Grand River’s fish are bottom feeders, so they’re eating the microplastics and heavy metals that could be in the sediment anyways. But if the Bubble Barrier pushes these pollutants up into the water, fish that aren’t bottom feeders might be attracted to the particles and eat them.

That means they’ll be full on microplastics, not nutritious food, so they’ll starve to death.

When bugs, bottom feeders and other fish eat pollutants, contaminants are exposed to the rest of the food chain and eventually people – a process called bioaccumulation.

Steinman said the solution to plastic pollution is regulating at the manufacturing level. Cleaning up plastics already in the environment is treating the symptom, not disease, he said.

However, Steinman said taking microplastics out of the Grand River will have benefits for the local area. It’ll make the system cleaner and take out some of those pollutants that could bioaccumulate.

And the bubble barrier could raise awareness around plastic pollution in the community.

“Because it's being placed in a heavy use area, there's tremendous educational opportunity around this,” Steinman said.

Others at MSU and GVSU will be conducting citizen surveys to find out how people feel about the project and encourage public engagement. They’re even teaming up with an artist, Avery Williamson, to create art installations around the potential barrier to teach residents about local water issues.

Marion, Indiana Facility Anchors Scalable Platform for Heavy Rare Earths, Defense Minerals, and Magnet Supply Chains

FISHERS, IN / ACCESS Newswire / January 5, 2026 / American Resources Corporation (NASDAQ:AREC) (""American Resources"") through its minority holding in ReElement Technologies Corporation (""ReElement"" or the ""Company""), a leading U.S. innovator in rare earth element (REE) and critical mineral refining for the commercial and defense industries, today announced the closing of a $200 million strategic equity facility from Transition Equity Partners, LLC (TEP).

This investment will accelerate the commercial deployment of ReElement's proprietary, multi-mineral refining platform, with an initial focus on the buildout of the Company's Marion, Indiana facility to meet near-term domestic demand. From this foundation, ReElement and TEP plan to strategically develop additional facilities across the United States and select international markets. Leveraging its versatile and modularly scalable refining architecture and proprietary chromatographic separation processes, the Marion site will focus on processing light rare earths, heavy rare earths and other critical defense elements. With TEP's support, the Marion facility will scale to an initial capacity greater than 10,000 metric tons per annum (MTPA) of refined critical minerals production sourced from recycled feedstocks, and mined mixed rare earth concentrates, with an ability to further scale in Marion and several other strategic locations.

ReElement is developing large-scale critical mineral processing and refining capacity to strengthen strategic United States supply chains. This includes the Company's recently announced partnership with the U.S. Department of War and Vulcan Elements to support a fully vertically integrated, domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. ReElement is also partnering with POSCO International Corporation, a global leader in steel, magnetic materials, and advanced industrial solutions, to further reinforce U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.

Beyond magnet supply chains, ReElement's proprietary chromatographic refining platform is uniquely capable of meeting demand for heavy rare earth elements and other critical defense materials that are not currently produced at scale in the United States. These include yttrium, gadolinium, germanium, antimony, terbium, dysprosium, and other essential minerals that underpin U.S. energy, advanced technology, and defense applications - and that remain subject to severe supply constraints and export controls from China.

Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies stated, ""We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners. Throughout this process, it became clear that we are closely aligned culturally and mission-wise - an alignment we believe is essential to addressing supply-chain challenges quickly while building long-term shareholder value. The $200 million commitment will enable ReElement to expand its manufacturing base initially in the United States and, over time, globally, to process and refine critical minerals and rare earth elements through a cost-competitive, modular, and scalable platform. TEP's global reach and experienced advisory network are also supporting ReElement's international expansion across Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). TEP is more than an equity sponsor; they are a strategic partner actively supporting ReElement's global growth.""

""TEP is committed and equally excited to partner with ReElement, Mark Jensen and his leading management team to help fortify the U.S. supply chain for critical energy and strategic infrastructure"" said Pat Eilers, Managing Partner and Founder of TEP, ""ReElement's uniquely superior processing platform enables the U.S. to leverage numerous domestic and ally feedstocks to bolster a diverse set of critical mineral supply chains that are essential for a strong U.S. economy. This capability is further supported by ReElement's collaboration with the U.S. government, and ability to ensure access to critical minerals necessary for energy dominance, AI leadership, strategic defense industries, among numerous other U.S. priorities. We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.""

Leveraging this strategic commitment, ReElement is positioned to play a critical role in securing U.S. and allied supply chains by delivering high-purity critical minerals at costs competitive with global markets. The Company's refining platform represents a new model for domestic and allied-nation processing - one that can be deployed rapidly, occupies a fraction of the footprint of traditional refineries, and produces ultra-high-purity outputs with significantly reduced environmental impact.

ReElement's modular approach enables rapid deployment across the United States and allied jurisdictions, co-location with mining or concentration assets, lower capital and operating costs, and cleaner, solvent-free processing compatible with U.S. environmental standards. Together, these advantages position ReElement to accelerate supply-chain resilience while supporting long-term industrial competitiveness, national security, and sustainable growth.

Every delay in phasing out fossil fuels makes crises like this more likely.","There are several ways to start a year on the wrong foot, and the government of the United States has just shown the world another one. On January 3, 2026, the US launched military strikes against Venezuela, captured president Nicolás Maduro, and declared it would take control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, opening the door for US oil companies to enter and rebuild the industry. This move comes just as the world is meant to be turning a corner – making 2026 the year to begin abandoning fossil fuels and charting a safer, more stable energy future.

Venezuela holds more oil than any other country in the world. The timing and emphasis on seizing control of the largest proven oil reserves on the planet make it clear that oil is central to this conflict, not just a side issue. This is the brutal continuity of fossil fuel politics: for decades, control over fossil resources has warped foreign policy, justified military interventions and wars, all while being dressed up as “security” or “economic necessity.”

As the climate crisis deepens, clinging to oil only multiplies the risks of locking us into a world of violence, volatility and authoritarian bargains. A safer future is not an abstract ideal, it is a political choice. Every investment in clean energy is an investment in peace, stability and self-determination.

As the new year begins, the question is stark: do we keep repeating the old, deadly patterns of oil-driven power, or finally choose an energy system that no longer demands war to sustain it?

This is not only about Venezuela, it is about all of us

This is not only about the people of Venezuela – although their lives, safety, and right to self-determination matter deeply. This is about the whole world. It is about what kind of energy future we choose, and who pays the price when powerful countries refuse to let go of fossil fuels – because the climate crisis does not stop at borders.

If we burn the estimated 303 billion barrels of crude oil in Venezuela’s reserves, it’s the whole planet who will pay the price – including those very American citizens the US government is now claiming to benefit. This Thursday will mark one year since the wildfires that tore through Los Angeles, destroying neighborhoods, forcing families to flee, and turning entire communities into ashes. Those fires were not an accident: every new oil field, every decision to expand drilling, adds more fuel to a crisis that is already harming millions of people who had no say in creating it.

Fossil fuels keep the world in crisis mode

The US decision to attack and seize control of Venezuela’s oil underscores just how far we remain from breaking the chains of oil dependency. Coal, oil and gas do not only heat the planet. They shape global politics in dangerous ways. Because fossil fuel reserves are concentrated in a few regions, they turn entire countries into permanent pressure points. Control over oil becomes control over power – and that power is defended with threats, sanctions, and sometimes bombs.

As long as fossil fuels remain the backbone of the global economy, conflict will always follow energy. Instability is not an accident in this system. It is built in. This is exactly what the climate movement has been warning about for decades: fossil fuels are not just a climate problem. They are a peace problem. A justice problem. A democracy problem.

Phase-out is not optional, it is urgent

2026 is supposed to be the year when governments finally started turning their fossil fuel promises into real action – and that is still possible. After years of warnings from scientists, after record heatwaves, floods, fires, and droughts, the direction is clear: phase out coal, oil, and gas, and move fast toward clean, renewable energy.

During the last UN climate conference in November 2025, more than 80 countries supported a roadmap to phase out fossil fuel use. That commitment was not symbolic. It was a recognition that continuing to depend on oil and gas locks the world into a future of climate disasters, political chaos, and rising conflict.

The final COP30 text failed to include any reference to fossil fuels, and the governments of Colombia and the Netherlands stepped forward to demonstrate much-needed leadership by announcing the first International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels. The landmark convening will take place on 28 – 29 April 2026 in Santa Marta, Colombia – and it’s a great opportunity for our leaders to make real and actionable commitments to stop oil and the (climate, political, humanitarian) chaos it seeds once and for all.

Clean energy is not just cleaner, it is safer. Solar panels do not start wars. Wind turbines do not require military protection. Community-owned renewables do not destabilize entire regions.

Environmental laws and regulations have their costs, to be sure, but these photographs still hold visceral power: They show just how far the nation has come and what is at risk if we forget.","Growing up in the 1970s, I took for granted the trash piles along the highway, tires washed up on beaches, and smog fouling city air. The famed “Crying Indian” commercial of 1971 became a symbol of widespread environmental damage across the United States.

That’s why the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970, energized the nation. In the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history, roughly 10% of the population took to the streets to shout together: “Enough is enough!”

Republican and Democratic politicians alike listened. Over the decade that followed, all the nation’s foundational environmental laws were passed with strong bipartisan support – the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and more.

These laws are taking a beating at the moment, including from the Environmental Protection Agency – the federal government agency created in 1970 to protect the environment. The agency’s own leader, Lee Zeldin, boasted of “driving a dagger straight into the heart” of environmental regulations. President Donald Trump regularly derides environmental laws as job killers and government overreach.

But the conditions that made these laws necessary have largely been forgotten. This environmental amnesia allows critics to focus entirely on costs while ignoring the laws’ very real benefits and achievements.

I’m an environmental law professor, so I was excited to learn recently about the Documerica project, courtesy of a wonderful article by writer Gideon Leek. It shows in clear photographic evidence how dirty the U.S. used to be and wakes people up to how much better the environment is today.

An inspired origin

Environmental protection was a bipartisan effort in the 1970s: The EPA was created by President Richard Nixon, a Republican. The agency’s first leader was Bill Ruckelshaus, a Republican congressman from Indiana.

Inspired by the famous photographs of Depression-era farmworkers commissioned in the 1930s by the Farm Security Administration, Ruckelshaus’ newly created EPA commissioned a nationwide photo record. The goal, as Leek put it, was to “provide the EPA with a great deal of qualitative environmental data, create a ‘visual baseline’ against which to judge their efforts, and introduce the agency to the country through art.”

In its few short years of operation, from 1972 through 1978, the Documerica project produced over 20,000 photographs of rivers and farms, highways and city streets. The photos provide a vivid window into the state of the U.S. environment in the 1970s. Now, looking back, they highlight the progress made in the decades since, a demonstration of environmental laws’ successes far more powerful than graphs and statistics.

Solid waste

As a kid, every Sunday my father and I would load the back of our station wagon with trash barrels and drive to the town dump – literally a hole in the ground. My dad would back up to the edge of the pit, and I would enthusiastically run out for what we called “The Olympic Trash Throw!” pouring the barrels’ contents down to where a bulldozer rumbled back and forth, compacting the trash while gulls circled overhead.

To say America’s landscape was littered in the 1970s is not merely poetic phrasing. Waste disposal was a matter of local law, and illegal dumping was commonplace. Drums of pesticides and chemicals could be sent to the local dump along with tires and just about anything else people and companies wanted to get rid of. When the dump was full, it was covered with topsoil and became open land, ready for recreation or building construction.

One place where this happened was Love Canal, a neighborhood near Niagara Falls, New York. A dump holding decades of chemical drums from the Hooker Chemical Co. was lightly covered and sold to the town for just $1. The town was grateful. A neighborhood was built on the land.

Only when people noticed high levels of miscarriages and cancer clusters among the residents – and saw oozing waste – did opinion change.

In 1976, Congress passed the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, which was the first law that tracked waste materials from their creation to their disposal and set tough standards for how to dispose of them. But by then, decades of unregulated waste disposal had contaminated sites all over the country. The contaminants, toxicity and people responsible were often unknown.

Four years later, the 1980 law known as “Superfund” set standards and assigned financial responsibility for cleaning up hazardous waste sites. The law created a multibillion-dollar fund that could pay for the cleanups and required potentially responsible parties to reimburse the government or clean up the sites on their own.

Faced with requirements to track their waste and heavy fines if the disposal resulted in hazardous sites, companies paid much more careful attention to their waste disposal. No one wanted to pay for cleaning up a Superfund site.

Water pollution

I had the misfortune in 1978 to capsize while sailing a boat on the Charles River in Boston. My shame turned to a dermatologist’s visit when I broke out in rashes the next day. You fell in the Charles at your peril.

Environmental advocates weren’t kidding when, in the 1960s and 1970s, they declared “Lake Erie is a dead lake” because of all the industrial pollution pouring into its waters. An oil slick on Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River famously caught fire in 1969, but it was actually the 12th time the river had burned in a century.

Just as with dumps on land, all kinds of waste was being disposed of in rivers, lakes and harbors. There was a federal law in place, but it was ineffective and relied on states to set limits and enforce them.

The Clean Water Act of 1972 sought to create a national standard, requiring companies that wanted to discharge waste into waterways to get a federal permit and use the best available technology to reduce the amount and toxicity of what they did dump. The act also provided billions of taxpayer dollars to upgrade sewage treatment plants so they didn’t just dump untreated sewage into the water.

The ambitious goal was to end water pollution entirely and make all of the nation’s waters safe for swimming and fishing within a decade. Those aspirational goals for the country’s waters still have not been fully met, though Ruckelshaus used to quip that at least they are not flammable.

Even more telling, the Charles River and other urban rivers that people avoided in the 1970s now boast all manner of recreation, with little or no risk of rashes even while swimming.

Air pollution

Perhaps the most obvious improvement since the 1970s has been in air quality around the U.S.

The horrible smog around Los Angeles is well known. But many other cities were blanketed in polluted air that led to respiratory illnesses and millions of early deaths across the nation over the decades. In Pittsburgh it was only half-jokingly said that you had to floss your teeth after breathing.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 was the first law to require the EPA to set uniform nationwide standards for air quality to protect the air people breathe. In short order, lead was phased out of gasoline, catalytic converters were required on cars, acid rain was ended, and the sources of smog were stringently regulated. An EPA study found that the benefits under the law exceeded costs by a factor of more than 30 to 1 and in 2020 alone prevented over 230,000 early deaths.

I could go on with photos and stories about laws from the 1970s that protected wetlands, conserved open space, reduced pesticide use, increased recycling and made many other changes to how Americans treat our lands and waters.

But it all boils down to two simple facts. First, with the exception of greenhouse gases, which have been effectively unregulated, every major measure of environmental health has improved significantly over the past five decades. And second, those improvements all occurred during times of strong economic growth, with inflation-adjusted gross domestic product increasing fivefold.

Calling these laws “job killers” misses the point entirely. They created jobs and stopped environmental killers. The laws now being demonized are the very reason the Documerica photos are images of the past, not the present. Environmental laws and regulations have their costs, to be sure, but these photographs still hold visceral power: They show just how far the nation has come and what is at risk if we forget.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/707881/original/file-20251210-64-w3cd9l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C706%2C7820%2C3910&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-05 09:58:36.327111

Two more operational EV battery plants — SK Battery America in Commerce, Georgia, and Samsung SDI in Kokomo, Indiana — also intend to begin ESS battery production in 2026.
Suddenly, with waning EV demand and underutilized lines, domestic EV battery manufacturers had to make up revenue elsewhere.
Where KORE Power, American Battery Factory and Pomega were only capable of supporting sub-5-GWh annual capacities, the EV battery makers are already set up for over 15-GWh outputs.
If battery energy storage systems use domestically made cells, they can more easily access the ITC under foreign entity of concern restrictions introduced by the OBBBA.","As with most industries treated favorably in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the domestic energy storage market was awash with new factory announcements. Companies like KORE Power, American Battery Factory and Pomega broke ground on gigawatt-scale production facilities throughout the United States, but nothing was ever built. They quickly realized it was expensive to build brand-new factories in a market wary of future federal support of renewable energy.

But that’s not to say the domestic manufacturing market for lithium-based ESS is nonexistent in 2026; it’s just being led by another clean energy product: electric vehicles.

The two operational lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) cell manufacturers today — LG Energy Solution in Michigan and AESC in Tennessee — had been making batteries for American EVs for over a decade before retooling existing lines to produce ESS batteries in 2025. Two more operational EV battery plants — SK Battery America in Commerce, Georgia, and Samsung SDI in Kokomo, Indiana — also intend to begin ESS battery production in 2026. Ford also plans to swap EV manufacturing for stationary storage.

The strategic pivot by the manufacturers is also influenced by the IRA and its successor, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The OBBBA removed incentives for EV owners while leaving intact IRA credits available to ESS installers and manufacturers. Suddenly, with waning EV demand and underutilized lines, domestic EV battery manufacturers had to make up revenue elsewhere. Now, they’re stationary battery suppliers.

This manufacturing swap is actually more beneficial to the U.S. ESS market than waiting for new names to come online in their own time. Where KORE Power, American Battery Factory and Pomega were only capable of supporting sub-5-GWh annual capacities, the EV battery makers are already set up for over 15-GWh outputs. That means more domestic batteries are available to U.S. project developers today when the grid needs them most.

It’s not as simple as a flip of a switch for EV battery manufacturers, though. EVs typically use lithium batteries made with nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC), while stationary ESS benefit from the LFP chemistry. If the form factor is the same (prismatic vs. cylindrical vs. pouch cells), updating NMC lines to LFP should ideally take less than 12 months, said Anjali Joshi, market intelligence analyst at Intertek CEA.

“If the form factor is the same, converting NCM to LFP cell production line takes several months to a year,” she said.

As with solar panel manufacturing, the cell is the most important part of the ESS. If battery energy storage systems use domestically made cells, they can more easily access the ITC under foreign entity of concern restrictions introduced by the OBBBA. Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP) expected the United States to install 49 GWh of storage across all markets in 2025, an amount that can easily be met by the four established domestic lithium cell manufacturers in 2026.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP VP of energy storage. “Despite regulatory uncertainty, the drivers for energy storage are strong and the industry is on track to produce enough grid batteries in American factories to supply 100% of domestic demand. Energy storage will be essential to the expansion of the U.S. power grid and American energy production.”

Joshi with Intertek CEA also feels confident in America’s lithium battery makers’ ability to meet domestic demand for ESS.

“Based on announced capacity, the U.S. is likely to have around a 10% FEOC-compliant capacity surplus in 2026, with Korean suppliers accounting for over 80% of the FEOC-compliant ESS cell capacity,” she said. “However, these figures assume 100% factory utilization, while Korean EV battery plants have historically run at 70-80%. So, the actual surplus will depend on how quickly Korean suppliers can fully ramp up their capacity.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-ESS-facility_production-line_electrode.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 08:59:04.907979

The “carbon intensity” of the Minnesota power grid ticked down another 4% in 2024 as utilities and energy developers added more renewable power, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said in April.
Efficiency is one thing nearly everyone involved in Minnesota energy policy agrees on, even if they emphasize different aspects.
Minnesota nuclear proponents want the state to lift its moratorium — the country’s strongest — and join the party.
“As other states have taken action on this…Minnesota is increasingly the outlier,” Rosenthal said at the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance forum.","Minnesota already gets more than half of its electricity from wind, solar, nuclear and other resources that don’t emit planet-warming carbon dioxide or air pollutants that harm human health. Power plants here emit 50% less greenhouse gas than 20 years ago, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.

Under state law, Minnesota’s power sector needs to go 100% clean by 2040, and there’s a sense among state policymakers, utility leaders and energy system experts that the easy part may soon be over.

Energy system modelers say efforts to reduce power emissions become costlier and more logistically challenging as the grid reorients around weather-dependent renewables. Adding more of what’s known as “clean firm” resources like nuclear, geothermal, hydropower, gas plants with carbon capture, and long-duration batteries — plus more high-voltage power lines — can address what Deloitte researchers call “the last 20%” problem.

The challenge for Minnesota is that these resources all have their own tradeoffs. Policymakers, utilities, labor and host communities appear far from consensus around the best path forward — particularly when it comes to nuclear power plants, which Minnesota law prohibits building more of.

Not fast enough?

The “carbon intensity” of the Minnesota power grid ticked down another 4% in 2024 as utilities and energy developers added more renewable power, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said in April.

The poster child for those efforts is Xcel Energy’s multiyear plan for the Sherco power plant, which by early next decade is set to host enough carbon-free power to replace most of its retiring coal units’ output. State regulators have approved a host of other clean energy projects over the past two years, including 910 megawatts’ worth — nearly the output of a full-size nuclear power plant — in a two-month span this summer.

For now, utility leaders, regulators and policymakers say Minnesota remains on track to meet its statutory obligation for 100% carbon-free power by 2040, but with a major caveat: electric vehicles, data centers and new industrial loads are pushing electricity demand upward. If built, Minnesota’s dozen or so large data center proposals would consume more power than every home in the state, according to the Star Tribune.

“Solar and wind aren’t going to do everything on their own. Yes, we are building out renewables, but not at the rate our demand for electricity is increasing,” said Rep. Spencer Igo, a third-term Republican who represents part of the Iron Range, at an October forum hosted by the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance.

The long-range plans filed by Minnesota’s two biggest for-profit utilities show firm resources like gas plants accounting for a significant share of new additions to the grid over the next decade-plus. Minnesota Power, now majority-owned by the private equity firm BlackRock, wants to add 750 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity to replace a coal power plant set to retire by 2035. Xcel Energy would deploy nearly 3,000 megawatts of batteries and “firm dispatchable” power to its system in the 2030s after adding 420 megawatts of gas at a new southwestern Minnesota power plant later this decade.

Xcel and Minnesota Power say their new gas plants would run only as needed to make up for temporary energy shortfalls caused by high power demand or periods of low wind. And Xcel is designing its Lyon County gas plant to run on a mix of at least 30% hydrogen, which does not emit greenhouse gases when burned and can be produced with carbon-free electricity (or possibly mined from natural reserves).

But in its most recent long-range plan, Xcel admits that squeezing all the greenhouse gas emissions out of its Upper Midwest grid — which covers parts of the Dakotas, Wisconsin and upper Michigan — will require “ingenuity, new technologies, and transmission.”

Leading contenders

None of those new technologies is perfect.

Geothermal power, which taps naturally occurring heat deep underground, has managed to unite environmentalists on the left with MAGA types on the right. That includes former fracking executive and now Energy Secretary Chris Wright. But even the “enhanced” geothermal systems being commercialized across the western United States today are no match for Minnesota’s stable geology, which makes getting the power out of the ground that much more difficult

Another technology that involves drilling thousands of feet into bedrock is carbon capture and sequestration. In theory, any carbon-emitting power plant could retrofit its exhaust system to absorb, liquefy and inject most of its greenhouse gas emissions deep underground.

Like geothermal power, however, long-term carbon storage requires specific subsurface conditions absent in Minnesota and much of the Midwest. Most power plants in the region would thus need to tie into yet-to-be-built pipelines like the long-planned Summit network, which would pipe carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Minnesota and four neighboring states to a storage site in western North Dakota.

Summit’s future is uncertain due to a recent regulatory setback in South Dakota and opposition from property owners regionwide. Even if it moves ahead, it will cost billions and take years to bring online. Perhaps more appealing is the potential for captured carbon to be used as an input for locally made “e-fuels” that could one day replace petroleum-based fuels for airplanes, ships and other heavy vehicles — if the economics ever make sense.

Theo Keith, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said Minnesota’s biggest investor-owned electric utility is taking a wait-and-see approach. Xcel doesn’t currently have plans for carbon capture and doesn’t think it’s needed to reach the 2040 goal, but it “could play a role in the future of clean energy as the technology improves and the cost comes down,” he said.

Then there’s long-duration energy storage, a grab-bag of surprisingly low-tech solutions that deliver power for at least 10 hours.

Some, like the iron-air batteries Great River Energy plans to power up next year, can discharge at full capacity for several days on end. While the lithium-ion batteries dominating the grid are now cheap enough to enable 24/7 solar power in sunnier parts of the world, they may never be economical for riding out the multi-day stretches of low sun and wind Minnesota sees every winter.

Long-duration energy storage could help. But it faces its own technical and economic challenges, particularly around energy losses during charging and discharging, said Kevin Pranis, marketing manager for Laborers International in Minnesota and North Dakota. Pranis’ union hosted the October nuclear forum.

“If you only get half your energy back, it costs twice as much to run,” he said. “I could see iron-air batteries totally transforming the world and eclipsing everything else — or not.” (Coal, gas and nuclear power plants also lose a lot of energy when converting heat to electricity.)

Efficiency is one thing nearly everyone involved in Minnesota energy policy agrees on, even if they emphasize different aspects.

The controversial bill that extended key tax breaks for data centers this year also requires large-scale computing facilities to pay up to $5 million annually into a home weatherization fund for lower-income Minnesotans. Sen. Nick Frentz, a Mankato Democrat who supported the bill, said that provision would reduce customers’ electric bills and relieve stress on the grid itself.

“I’m surprised how little attention that feature is getting,” he said. “The less energy these houses use, the less pressure on our grid…it’s a big win.”

Meanwhile, DFL Reps. Larry Kraft and Kari Rehrauer want Xcel Energy and other Minnesota utilities to develop “virtual power plants” to offset 10% of their electric demand within three years.

Virtual power plants use home batteries, thermostats and other small-scale energy resources to alleviate grid constraints on the relatively rare occasions — typically on the hottest summer days — when power demand pushes the otherwise overbuilt grid to its limit. They’re far cheaper than conventional power plants, can be deployed in months rather than years, and help get more out of the existing grid without expensive new infrastructure, said George Damian, director of government affairs for Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.

“We have a system that we’ve already paid for…(so) how can we operate it better,” Damian said.

The nuclear option

Some say Minnesota’s grid would operate better if it had more nuclear power — the one resource it’s not allowed to add courtesy of a 30-year-old legislative moratorium.

At the October forum, speakers hailed the economic and environmental benefits of nuclear power. Nuclear plants employ twice as many people as similarly-sized coal plants. They pay better than most other energy employers. They’re cleaner, even considering the issue of waste storage. They’re usually the biggest taxpayers in their communities: Xcel’s Prairie Island nuclear plant accounts for 54% of Red Wing’s city tax base and 40% of its school district’s tax base, according to an analysis by Center for Energy and the Environment. And despite high construction costs, they may actually reduce the long-run cost of reaching 100% clean power.

“Eighty to 85% of the electricity we are going to need will come from tools we already have,” like wind, solar, batteries and high-voltage transmission, said Michael Noble, former executive director of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy. But “if we rely on (them) to do 100% of the job, we’re going to pay way too much for electricity…we need firm power that you can turn on when you need it,” he added.

Noble said he was motivated to speak publicly for the first time about his support for nuclear power because after decades of dithering, the industry “has its act together enough to build new nuclear.”

Dozens of startups have designs for “small modular” nuclear plants they say are safer and cheaper to build than the full-size reactors operating today. So do a handful of better-known companies, like GE and Rolls-Royce. And after 30 years during which the United States added virtually no nuclear capacity, two full-size reactors powered up earlier this decade in Georgia.

The Trump administration is all-in on nuclear. Wright, the secretary of the Department of Energy, sat on the board of well-connected nuclear startup Oklo before taking his current job. In the year since, he has reduced his department’s support for renewables while putting billions toward nuclear, geothermal and fossil fuels.

President Trump himself could reap billions from the proposed merger of his social media company and another startup aiming to commercialize nuclear fusion, a nascent technology that futurists hope ushers in an era of cheap, near-limitless energy without the long-lived radioactive waste.

Minnesota nuclear proponents want the state to lift its moratorium — the country’s strongest — and join the party. Other Midwestern states — including Democratic leaning states — have done the same: Wisconsin in 2016, Illinois just this year. If Minnesota doesn’t act soon, the long-awaited nuclear construction boom could pass it by, said Aaron Rosenthal, research director for North Star Policy Action.

“As other states have taken action on this…Minnesota is increasingly the outlier,” Rosenthal said at the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance forum. Rosenthal was the sole credited author on a pro-nuclear policy paper distributed at the event.

A Republican-led effort to repeal the nuclear construction ban came up short in the 2025 legislative session, but lawmakers are likely to try again in 2026 as development-hungry Greater Minnesota communities turn up the pressure. A coalition of 18 rural counties joined the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance in October, followed by future Xcel gas plant host Lyon County in November.

Arguments against new nuclear plants emphasize high construction costs and long build times. The two new Georgia reactors came in seven years late and $17 billion over budget, double the initial estimate. North America’s first small modular reactor, in Ontario, looks more expensive than expected, too. Proponents say costs will come down as more plants get built, citing the “learning curves” that have made wind, solar and now batteries competitive with fossil fuels; skeptics aren’t so sure.

But that debate is almost a sideshow in Minnesota. Here, any successful effort to lift the moratorium runs through the Prairie Island Indian Community, which remains opposed. In the 1970s, an Xcel predecessor company kept the tribe in the dark as it built the Prairie Island nuclear plant on its doorstep. Since the 1990s, amid a federal stalemate on long-term nuclear waste storage, radioactive spent fuel has accumulated at the site over what Rosenthal’s paper called “explicit tribal objections.” At the forum, Igo called the tribe’s treatment “horribly wrong.”

It’s an existential issue for a community whose federal recognition is tied to that particular piece of land, said Blake Johnson, the tribe’s government relations specialist.

“If something were to happen that made us evacuate and not able to return, we don’t exist as a tribe…there is still no solution to the waste that sits 700 yards from our people,” he said at the forum. The tribe’s consultations with legislators last session failed to yield a breakthrough, he added.

Igo said he would keep trying.

“We are going to move forward together or we’re not going to move forward,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24077210421_cc6f35e9aa_o-2048x1292.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 10:14:37.204106

Hyperscalers have rushed to build data centers to power artificial intelligence, spiking load growth forecasts to record-high levels. But they’re running up against a patchwork of outdated grid rules that aren’t designed to add so many massive power users — nor the new transmission and generation the new load requires — in the quick timeframe companies are demanding.

The scenario has led some energy analysts to predict capacity shortfalls by 2028 in regions like PJM and ERCOT. Faced with that looming crunch, these large power users have begun prioritizing novel speed-to-power solutions, redefining how the energy transition unfolds as a result.

The debates at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over whether data centers can be flexible grid assets. Hyperscalers building their own generation. A raft of new companies like Fermi and Creekstone buying up land out West and promising to supply power, initially with gas generators, to hyperscalers fast. Big bets on clean baseload technologies both imminent and further off, from a major fundraise by geothermal developer Fervo Energy, to Trump Media’s unusual merger with the fusion player TAE Technologies.

These developments reflect how the energy transition, once largely driven by climate policy, is now defined by the scramble for firm, fast power. And the great electron race shows no signs of slowing down — even as chatter of an AI bubble grows.

The largest tech players combined were on track to spend roughly $400 billion in 2025, with the majority dedicated to AI infrastructure including chips, grid upgrades, and bespoke energy assets. Goldman Sachs analysts estimate hyperscalers’ capex may be more than $500 billion this year.

Tech giants, meet FERC

The role of FERC transformed in 2025 thanks to the speed-to-power push. An agency historically focused on interregional transmission and gas pipelines is now taking steps to speed up the connection of AI data centers, partly due to a directive from the Trump administration.

In October, Energy Secretary Chris Wright asked FERC to expedite the connection of large loads that agree to be curtailable, such as data centers, to the transmission system.

The request was part of a broader proposal to expand federal regulatory authority over interconnection, which has traditionally been left to states. The queue has become backlogged with requests from AI data centers and manufacturers, which Wright said requires “prompt attention.” Otherwise, the delay will hamper “a new era of American prosperity,” the order read.

The directive has led to more questions than answers, including how load flexibility would work in practice. Other major flashpoints among hyperscalers, utilities, grid operators, and consumer advocates who responded to the docket include who should get priority access to the grid and how to pay for it. The debate will continue to play out in 2026. Wright directed FERC to propose a role by April, which would be lightning speed for the agency.

FERC took another step aimed at speeding up AI data center development just two weeks ago. On December 18, the agency ordered PJM to overhaul its rules to allow data centers to colocate at power plants — potentially without waiting for a build-out of new transmission lines. It was a win for companies including Constellation Energy and NextEra, which plan to restart mothballed nuclear reactors solely to power AI data centers by Microsoft and Google, respectively.

Bring-your-own

Some companies are finding ways to skirt the gridlock by bringing their own solutions, shoring up extra capacity from distributed energy resources, or even going off-grid altogether by building behind-the-meter power plants.

xAI — Elon Musk’s AI company that trains and operates Grok — spent 2025 bringing massive compute and power online in record time at its Colossus facility in South Memphis, Tennessee. The campus was able to do that using a hybrid power strategy: direct grid connection paired with massive on-site generation from gas turbines. It comes with a steep environmental cost for local residents forced to breathe the resulting air pollution; Colossus installed at least 20 additional gas turbines this year, with plans to expand even more by early 2026.

A similar approach was deployed at the first site under Project Stargate, the network of AI data centers underway by OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank. The campus in Abilene, Texas, which came online this year, has a grid connection and a newly constructed gas plant. But a second location in Shackelford County, Texas is expected to be completely off-grid, with up to 1.4 GW of gas generators.

For companies going behind-the-meter, gas generators and fuel cells are often the technology of choice, mainly because they’re available now and can be a bridge until the grid is less congested. Data centers are also embracing batteries for on-site power, and to secure a faster interconnection.

Out West, several projects plan to use gas turbines in the short-term, then explore a mix of energy sources like solar, battery storage, and SMRs to build upwards of 10 gigawatts of capacity later on.

Fermi Inc., the startup backed by former energy secretary Rick Perry, claims it will have the country’s largest combined-cycle gas projects at an AI data center campus in Texas. The company made headlines in October for its $16 billion IPO, in part because it doesn’t have any public customers or revenue yet. But in December, Fermi’s share price plummeted by 34% in a single day, after the company said a prospective tenant terminated a $150 million deal to help fund construction. Toby Neugebauer, Fermi’s billionaire CEO, told Business Insider that Amazon was the tenant but then ultimately walked back the statement.

Flexibility

While major power users have long mulled load flexibility, the concept got a major boost in February, when a group of Duke University researchers released a paper finding that the grid could have more than 100 GW of extra capacity — if only large loads are willing to flex their energy use.

The paper collided with the speed-to-power rush, contributing to a growing wave of interest in the concept. A new ecosystem of companies and pilot projects have emerged, including a partnership between Nvidia, Emerald AI, EPRI, Digital Realty, and PJM to build the world’s first power-flexible AI campus. The goal, relying on software developed by the startup Emerald AI, is to match certain training jobs to times when the grid has spare capacity. The group’s first facility, a 96-megawatt project in Virginia, is slated to open in the first half of 2026.

Hyperscalers hope that by agreeing to curtail their energy use, grid operators might let them skip to the front of the line in interconnection queues. Whether that’s possible practically speaking, however, is up for debate; one particularly skeptical report from PJM’s independent market monitor called data center flexibility a “regulatory fiction.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2026-01-02T105534.692.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-05 10:14:46.407101

The two automotive juggernauts believe fuel cell vehicles are viable for production and continue to pursue this niche, while most rivals have given up. Toyota has admitted the Mirai hasn’t been a success, yet it still maintains that hydrogen has a future.

BMW has been researching hydrogen vehicles since the 1970s, but it has never brought one to market. That will finally change in 2028, when the iX5 Hydrogen goes on sale. While many argue that fuel cell vehicles are a futile effort, the German luxury brand takes a different view. BMW’s Chief Technology Officer told Auto Motor und Sport that hydrogen will play a “crucial role” in the car industry.

Joachim Post expects hydrogen infrastructure to expand in the coming years. BMW hasn’t decided whether it will launch additional fuel cell models beyond the iX5 60H xDrive, but it believes momentum is building: “There’s a lot happening in Japan, Korea, and California right now.”

Although the hydrogen-powered iX5 is unlikely to be a strong seller initially, BMW’s CTO highlights one key advantage of fuel cell vehicles. An FCEV would make BMW less reliant on certain raw materials than conventional EVs, which require large battery packs. Naturally, hydrogen cars are also seen in Munich as another tool for achieving decarbonization. “We are convinced that our strategy of technological openness is absolutely right.”

The iX5 Hydrogen will be built on the same Spartanburg assembly line as the combustion-engine X5. The battery-electric iX5 will also be produced at the South Carolina plant, with all versions of the luxury SUV sharing the CLAR platform. That lineup includes plug-in hybrids and the hotter V8-powered M variants.

You won’t have to wait until 2028 to buy the fifth-generation X5. The “G65” is actually set to arrive later this year with gasoline, diesel, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric drivetrains. Roughly two years after that, the fuel cell version will become BMW’s first commercially available hydrogen car. All previous efforts were limited to demonstration and trial vehicles, none of which were sold to customers.

BMW and Toyota aren’t the only automakers that still believe in hydrogen. While Stellantis and General Motors have recently pulled the plug, brands like Honda and Hyundai continue to see fuel cell vehicles as part of the solution for reducing fleet emissions.",https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bmw-ix5-hydrogen-g65-prototype-08.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:58:32.454345

The U.S. Department of Energy issued an emergency order late Tuesday to keep an aging Colorado coal plant open, just one day before it was slated to close.

The plant — Unit 1, part of Craig Station, in Moffat County — is now required to keep running until March 30, 2026. The order can also be extended.

The move drew a furious response from the governor’s office and environmental groups, who contest whether an emergency even exists that would require the plant to stay open.

Governor Polis said the order would lead to a huge spike in costs to repair the plant, which may be borne by customers of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, a cooperative operating the plant to deliver electricity to rural communities in Nebraska, New Mexico, Wyoming and Colorado.

“This order will pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado ratepayers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed,” Polis said in a statement.

“Ludicrously, the coal plant isn’t even operational right now, meaning repairs — to the tune of millions of dollars — just to get it running, all on the backs of rural Colorado ratepayers!”

In a statement posted to its website, Tri-State confirmed the coal-fired power plant unit broke down on Dec. 19 after a valve failed, and said restarting operations will require additional investment. The cooperative is currently reviewing how to comply with the order while limiting costs for its customers, which provide electricity to rural communities.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley.

Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright invoked Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to keep the plant open. The law allows the federal government to order power plants to stay open during emergencies — like during times of war, in the aftermath of disasters or when there’s a shortage of electricity.

But this year, the Trump administration has repeatedly used the law to keep the lights on at plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana and other states.

In its order, the DOE said Colorado is on the verge of facing a dire energy emergency, because of the retirement of power plants and a spike in electricity demand.

Losing Craig Unit 1 could lead to a “loss of power to homes, and businesses in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety,” according to the order.

The environmental group Earthjustice said in a statement that the order was illegal and the DOE’s claims are unsupported. It has already sued the Trump administration over other emergency orders to keep coal plants open.

“This unlawful order will benefit no one but the struggling coal industry,” said Michael Hiatt, deputy managing attorney with Earthjustice’s Rocky Mountain Office. “We are prepared to take action to defend Colorado communities and ensure a just transition.”

Keeping coal plants open can be expensive, because it often disrupts years of planning by regulators and utility companies.

One analysis by the firm Grid Strategies, prepared for the Sierra Club, found it could cost around $85 million to run Craig 1 for a year at its average output. Those costs may be passed onto customers in the form of higher bills.

The plan to close Unit 1 has been in the works for years, and is part of Colorado’s push to phase out coal plants. While the DOE’s order may have upended those plans, it’s hardly a surprise.

Tri-State has said it has been expecting the order for months.

Takemura, Canary Media",,,,,https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2026/01/why-this-colorado-coal-town-is-digging-geothermal/,"For decades, Dallas Robinson’s family excavation company developed coal mines and power plants in the rugged, fossil-fuel-rich region of northwest Colorado.
Geothermal energy ​“is literally so sustainable — like, you could generate those megawatts forever.
At least one other northwest Colorado coal community is also getting on board with geothermal.
With dozens of communities warming to the notion, ​“it’s an exciting time for geothermal in Colorado,” said Bryce Carter, geothermal program manager at the state energy office.
After also accounting for a bonanza of state incentives, the $14-million project will only be $2.2 million, Mendisco said.","For decades, Dallas Robinson’s family excavation company developed coal mines and power plants in the rugged, fossil-fuel-rich region of northwest Colorado. It was a good business to be in, one that helped hamlets like Hayden grow from outposts to bustling mountain towns — and kept families like Robinson’s rooted in place for generations.

“This area, with the exception of agriculture, was built on oil and gas and coal,” said Robinson, a former town councilor for Hayden.

But that era is coming to a close. Across the United States, bad economics and even worse environmental impacts are driving coal companies out of business. The 441-megawatt coal-burning power plant just outside Hayden is no exception: It’s shutting down by the end of 2028. The Twentymile mine that feeds it is expected to follow.

Coal closures can gut communities like Hayden, a town of about 2,000 people. That story has been playing out for decades, particularly in Appalachia, where coal regions with depressed economies have seen populations decline as people strike out for better opportunities elsewhere. Robinson, a friendly, gregarious guy, fears the same could happen in Hayden.

“I grew up here, so I know everyone,” he said. ​“It’s hard to see people lose their jobs and have to move away. … These are families that sweat and bled and been through the good and the bad times in small towns like this.”

Struggling American coal towns need an economic rebirth as the fossil-fuel industry fades. Hayden has a vision that, at first, doesn’t sound all that unusual. The town is developing a 58-acre business and industrial park to attract a diverse array of new employers.

The innovative part: companies that move in will get cheap energy bills at a time of surging utility costs. The town is installing tech that’s still uncommon but gaining traction — a geothermal heating-and-cooling system, which will draw energy from 1,000 feet underground.

In short, Hayden is tapping abundant renewable energy to help invigorate its economy. That’s a playbook that could serve other communities looking to rise from the coal dust.

At an all-day event hosted by geothermal drilling startup Bedrock Energy this summer, I saw the ambitious project in progress. Under a blazing sun, a Bedrock drilling rig chewed methodically into the region’s ochre dirt. Once it finished this borehole — one of about 150 — it would feed in a massive spool of black pipe to transfer heat.

Bedrock will complete the project, providing 2 megawatts of thermal energy, in phases, with roughly half the district done in 2026 and the whole job finished by 2028. Along the way, constructed buildings will be able to connect with portions of the district as they’re ready.

“We see it as a long-term bet,” Mathew Mendisco, city manager of Hayden, later told me, describing the town as full of grit and good people. Geothermal energy ​“is literally so sustainable — like, you could generate those megawatts forever. You’re never going to have to be reliant on the delivery of coal or natural gas. … You drill it on-site, the heat comes out.”

Geothermal is also the rare renewable resource that the Trump administration has embraced. In July, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, whose firm invested in geothermal developer Fervo Energy, helped convince Congress to spare key federal investment tax credits for the sector.

These incentives apply to both the deep projects for producing power as well as the more accessible, shallower installations for keeping buildings comfy. Unlike geothermal projects for power, ones for direct heating and cooling don’t depend on geography; any town can take advantage of the resource.

“We disagree on the urgency of addressing climate change, [but] this is something that Chris Wright and I agree on,” Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper (D), a trained geologist, told a packed conference-room crowd on the day of the event. ​“Geothermal energy has … unbelievable potential to, at scale, create clean energy.”

Charting a post-coal economy

The eventual closure of the Hayden Station coal plant, which has operated for more than half a century, has loomed over the town since Xcel Energy announced an early shutdown in 2021.

The power plant and the mine employ about 240 people. Property taxes from those businesses have historically provided more than half the funding for the town’s fire management and school districts — though that fraction is shrinking thanks to recent efforts to diversify Hayden’s economy, Mendisco said.

Taking into account the other businesses that serve the coal industry and its workers, according to Mendisco, the economic fallout from the closures is projected to be a whopping $319 million per year.

“Really, the highest-paying jobs, the most stable jobs, with the best benefits [and] the best retirement, are in coal and coal-fired power plants,” Robinson said.

But coal has been in decline for over 20 years, largely due to growing investment in cheap fossil gas and renewables. While the Trump administration tries to defibrillate the coal industry and force uneconomic coal plants to stay open past their planned closure dates, states including Colorado still plan to phase out fossil fuels in the coming years. Colorado’s remaining six coal plants are set to shutter by the end of the decade.

Hayden aims for its business park to help the town weather this transition. With 15 lots to be available for purchase, the development is designed to provide more than 70 jobs and help offset a portion of the tax losses from Hayden Station’s closure, according to Mendisco.

“We are not going to sit on our hands and wait for something to come save us,” Mayor Ryan Banks told me at the event.

Companies that move into the business park won’t have a gas bill. They’ll be insulated from fossil-fuel price spikes, like those that occurred in December 2022, when gas prices leapt in the West and customers’ bills skyrocketed by 75% on average from December 2021.

In the Hayden development, businesses will be charged for their energy use by the electric utility and by a geothermal municipal utility that Hayden is forming to oversee the thermal energy network. Rather than forcing customers to pay for the infrastructure upfront, the town will spread out those costs on energy bills over time — like investor-owned utilities do. Unlike a private utility, though, Hayden will take no profit. Mendisco said he expects the geothermal district to cut energy costs by roughly 40%, compared with other heating systems.

Municipally owned geothermal districts are rare in the U.S., but the approach has legs. Pagosa Springs, Colorado, has run its geothermal network since the early 1980s, when it scrambled to combat fuel scarcity during the 1970s oil embargo. New Haven, Connecticut, recently broke ground on a geothermal project for its train station and a new public housing complex. And Ann Arbor, Michigan, has plans to build a geothermal district to help make one neighborhood carbon-neutral.

Hayden’s infrastructure investment is already attracting business owners. An industrial painting company has bought a plot, and so has a regional alcohol distributor, Mendisco said.

One couple is particularly excited to be a part of the town’s clean energy venture. Nate and Steph Yarbrough own DIY off-grid-electrical startup Explorist.Life; renewable power is in the company’s DNA. The Yarbroughs teach people how to put solar panels and batteries on camper vans, boats, and cabins to fuel their outdoor adventures, and Explorist.Life sells the necessary gear.

“When we bought that property, it was largely because of the whole geothermal concept,” Nate Yarbrough told me. ​“We thought it made a whole bunch of sense with what we do.”

Reducing reliance on hydrocarbons, he noted, is ​“a good thing for society overall.”

Geothermal tech heats up

The geothermal network that could transform Hayden’s future is mostly invisible from aboveground. Besides the drilling rig and a trench, the most prominent features I spotted were flexible tubes jutting from the earth like bunny ears.

Those ends of buried U-shaped pipes will eventually connect to a main distribution loop for businesses to hook up to. Throughout the network, pipes will ferry a nontoxic mix of water and glycol — a heat-carrying fluid that electric heat pumps can tap to keep buildings toasty in the winter and chilled in the summer.

Despite their superior efficiency, these heat pumps are far less common than the kind that pull from the ambient air, largely due to project cost. Because you have to drill to install a ground-source heat pump, the systems are typically about twice as expensive as air-source heat pumps.

But the underground infrastructure lasts 50 years or more, and the systems pay for themselves in fuel-cost savings more quickly in places that endure frostier temperatures, including Rocky Mountain municipalities like Hayden. Those long-term cost benefits were too attractive to ignore, Mendisco said.

Hayden’s project ​“is 100% replicable today,” Mendisco told attendees at the event, which included leaders of other mountain towns. Geothermal tech is ready; the money is out there, he added: ​“You can do this.”

Colorado certainly believes that — and it’s giving first-mover communities a boost.

In October, the state energy office announced $7.3 million in merit-based tax-credit awards for four geothermal projects. Vail is getting nearly $1.8 million for a network, into which the ice arena can dump heat and the library can soak it up. Colorado Springs will use its $5 million award to keep a downtown high school comfortable year-round. Steamboat Springs and a Denver neighborhood will share the rest of the funding.

At least one other northwest Colorado coal community is also getting on board with geothermal. In the prior round of state awards, the energy office granted $58,000 to the town of Craig’s Memorial Regional Health to explore a project for its medical campus.

With dozens of communities warming to the notion, ​“it’s an exciting time for geothermal in Colorado,” said Bryce Carter, geothermal program manager at the state energy office.

So far, the state has pumped $30.5 million into geothermal developments — with over $27 million going toward heating-and-cooling projects specifically — through its grant and tax-credit programs. The larger tax-credit incentive still has about $13.8 million left in its coffers.

Hayden, for its part, is also taking advantage of the federal tax credits to save up to 50% on the cost of its geothermal district. That includes a 10% bonus credit that the community qualifies for because of its coal legacy. After also accounting for a bonanza of state incentives, the $14-million project will only be $2.2 million, Mendisco said.

Tech innovation could further improve geothermal’s prospects, even in areas with less generous inducements than Colorado’s. Bedrock Energy, for one, aims to drive down costs by using advanced sensing technology that allows it to see the subsurface and make computationally guided decisions while drilling.

“In Hayden, we have gone from about 25 hours for a 1,000-foot bore to about nine hours for a 1,000-foot bore — in just the last couple of months,” Joselyn Lai, Bedrock’s co-founder and CEO, told me at the event. Overall, the firm’s subsurface construction costs from the first quarter of 2025 to the second quarter fell by about 16%, she noted.

Hayden is likely just at the start of its geothermal journey. If all goes well with the business park, the town aims to retrofit its municipal buildings with these systems to comply with the state’s climate-pollution limits on big buildings, Mendisco said. Hayden’s community center could be the first to get a geothermal makeover starting in 2027, he added.

Robinson, despite coal’s salience in the region and his family’s legacy in its extraction, believes in Hayden’s vision: Geothermal could be a winner in a post-coal economy. In fact, he’s interested in investing in the geothermal industry and installing a system in a new house he’s building, he said.

“I’ve lived a lot of my life making a living by exploiting natural resources. I understand the value of that — as well as lessening our impact and being able to find new and better,” Robinson said. ​“This is the next step, right?”

Trump administration suspends 5 wind projects off the East Coast, cites national security concerns

MATTHEW DALY

Associated Press

Published: January 5, 2026

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration recently suspended leases for five large-scale offshore wind projects under construction along the East Coast due to what it said were national security risks identified by the Pentagon.

The suspension, effective immediately, is the latest step by the administration to hobble offshore wind in its push against renewable energy sources. It comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Donald Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, calling it unlawful.

The administration said the pause will give the Interior Department, which oversees offshore wind, time to work with the Defense Department and other agencies to assess the possible ways to mitigate any security risks posed by the projects. The statement did not detail the national security risks. It called the move a pause, but did not specify an end date.

""The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,"" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. ""Today's action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers.""

Wind proponents slammed the move, saying it was another blow in an ongoing attack by the administration against clean energy. The administration's decision to cite potential national security risks could complicate legal challenges to the move, although wind supporters say those arguments are overstated.

Projects paused over national security concerns

The administration said leases are paused for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.

The Interior Department said unclassified reports from the U.S. government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called ""clutter."" The clutter caused by offshore wind projects can obscure legitimate moving targets and generate false targets in the vicinity of wind projects, the Interior Department said.

National security expert and former Commander of the USS Cole Kirk Lippold disputed the administration's national security argument. The offshore projects were awarded permits ""following years of review by state and federal agencies,"" including the Coast Guard, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Air Force and more, he said.

""The record of decisions all show that the Department of Defense was consulted at every stage of the permitting process,"" Lippold said, arguing that the projects would benefit national security because they would diversify the country's energy supply.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I, said Revolution Wind was thoroughly vetted and fully permitted by the federal government, ""and that review included any potential national security questions."" Burgum's action ""looks more like the kind of vindictive harassment we have come to expect from the Trump administration than anything legitimate,'' he said.

A judge ruled blocking wind projects was unlawful

The administration's action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was ""arbitrary and capricious"" and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump's Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity. Trump has said wind turbines are ugly, expensive and pose a threat to birds and other wildlife.

Wind proponents slam the move

Wind supporters called the administration's actions illegal and said offshore wind provides some of the most affordable, reliable electric power to the grid.

""For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country's need for electricity is surging,"" said Ted Kelly of the Environmental Defense Fund.

""Now the administration is again illegally blocking clean, affordable energy,"" Kelly said. ""We should not be kneecapping America's largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity.''

The administration's actions are especially egregious because, at the same time, it is propping up aging, expensive coal plants ""that barely work and pollute our air,"" Kelly said.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong called the lease suspension a ""lawless and erratic stop-work order"" that revives an earlier, failed attempt to halt construction of Revolution Wind.

""Every day this project is stalled is another day of lost work, another day of unaffordable energy costs and burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach,"" Tong said. ""We are evaluating all legal options, and this will be stopped just like last time.""

Suspension is praised by anti-wind group

A New Jersey group that opposes offshore wind hailed the administration's actions.

""Today, the president and his administration put America first,'' said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, a nonprofit advocacy group.

""Placing largely foreign-owned wind turbines along our coastlines was never acceptable,"" he said, arguing that Empire Wind, in particular, poses a threat because of its close proximity to major airports, including Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and JFK.

Offshore wind projects also pose a threat to commercial and recreational fishing industries, Shaffer and other critics say.

Developers of U.S. offshore projects include Denmark-based Orsted, Norway-based Equinor and a subsidiary of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola. Orsted, which owns two of the projects affected, saw stock prices decline by more than 11% the day of the suspension.

Richmond-based Dominion Energy, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, said its project is essential for national security and meeting Virginia's dramatically growing energy needs, driven by dozens of new data centers.

""Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability ... lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,"" the company said in a statement.

Pausing the Virginia project, which is nearly 70% complete, creates a ""perfect storm"" to harm customer affordability and grid reliability, said David Shepheard, an energy expert at Baringa, a global consulting firm.

East Coast residents are familiar with winter storms that can devastate local economies, Shepheard said, adding: ""This is a new one for the area: a Washington-borne nor'easter where the political winds are going to stop the blades from spinning.""

For decades, Continental has been a pioneer in unconventional resource development across the United States. With daily production reaching 500,000 BOEPD in 2025, nearly 3 billion barrels equivalent of captured resources, and more than 5,200 operated wells, the company's track record is defined by technological innovation, operational discipline, and financial stewardship. That legacy positions Continental well as it evaluates global opportunities, including Argentina's Vaca Muerta—a world-class shale resource that aligns exceptionally well with Continental's technical strengths and history of innovation.

In November, Continental signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with another Argentine producer, subject to closing conditions, to acquire operated interests in the Los Toldos II Oeste block. Continental now expands its presence in Argentina with this transaction.

""Vaca Muerta is one of the most compelling shale plays in the world, and we're thrilled to continue to invest in Argentina and build Continental's position through this agreement with Pan American Energy,"" said Doug Lawler, President & CEO of Continental Resources. ""PAE is a highly capable operator with deep basin experience. We're eager to learn from PAE and share Continental's unconventional expertise to advance the Vaca Muerta.""

Continental's non-operating position with PAE will allow for shared insights across subsurface characterization, development planning, completion design evolution, operating practices, infrastructure, and market pathways.

Marcos Bulgheroni, CEO of Pan American Energy said, ""This strategic relationship with one of the leading independent oil and gas companies in the United States aims to accelerate the development of the four areas in both provinces. As a non-operating owner, Continental will contribute its know-how in de-risking, development, and operational efficiency, with the goal of unlocking the enormous unconventional resources our country possesses.""

This milestone agreement represents a meaningful step forward as Continental continues building momentum in Vaca Muerta through a balanced approach that combines non-operated participation and operated development.

""These recent transactions in Argentina strengthen Continental's long-term value strategy: participating in world-class resources here and abroad, accelerating basin learning through ongoing development exposure, and applying that knowledge to drive robust results over time,"" Lawler added. ""We take a long-term view of resource development, regardless of geography. As I like to say, 'The rock doesn't know what country it's in.'""

At this time in 2024, Michigan was expecting a windfall of federal funds to fuel a transition to clean energy, along with billions of dollars’ worth of green manufacturing projects subsidized by the Biden administration’s signature climate spending bills.

But since President Donald Trump began his second term in January and began scrapping federal climate programs he refers to collectively as “the green new scam,” Michigan has seen a wave of project and grant cancellations, along with renewed investment in fossil fuel-based manufacturing and power generation.

Roughly $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day, according to a national database compiled by Atlas Public Policy, while shifting market forces and the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles have caused clean manufacturing investments in Michigan to whipsaw from billions annually in recent years to $3 billion in canceled investments this year.

“It certainly mirrors what we’re seeing nationally,” said Annabelle Rosser, a research analyst with the national firm.

Instead, Michigan automakers are scaling back and refocusing on gas and hybrid vehicle production — a trend emblemized by Ford’s and General Motors’ recent decisions to scrap EV production plans at Michigan plants and retool to produce gas-powered vehicles.

“That’s just the way the market is shaking out right now,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an affiliate of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

It’s a trend likely to continue into 2026, as Trump administration officials continue their efforts to downplay climate change, deemphasize renewable energy and embrace fossil fuels.

Here’s where things stand in Michigan as the year draws to a close:

$540 million in canceled funding

Michigan has seen $540 million in cancelled funding, with the biggest chunk coming from the Solar for All Program, a $7 billion US Environmental Protection Agency fund meant to expand solar energy in disadvantaged communities.

Michigan had been slated to receive a $156 million grant through that fund, while Native American tribes in the state were expecting part of a $62 million grant shared with other Great Lakes tribes.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued over the grant cancellations, joining 22 other states to argue the administration “unilaterally and illegally terminated” the program, overstepping checks and balances to cancel congressionally approved funding.

Beyond the solar program, the federal government has cancelled or proposed to cancel more than 20 Michigan grants ranging from $31.7 million to help LuxWall Inc. build an energy-efficient window glass factory in Detroit to $14,000 for a west Michigan climate resilience project.

Other canceled grants include:

$28.2 million for TS Conductor to build a high-capacity power line plant in Erie

$20.4 million for Ecoworks, a Detroit nonprofit that planned to convert houses of worship into climate resilience hubs

$20 million for the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan to improve energy efficiency in tribal homes

$20 million for the Southwestern Michigan Planning Commission to build two resilience hubs in Benton Harbor, upgrade energy efficiency in low-income housing and support a workforce development initiative

Smaller grants would have funded energy efficient housing in Kalamazoo, a climate change and resilience plan for the city of Flint and wild rice bed restoration in Michigan waterways.

The Trump administration has also frozen a $20 billion federal “green bank” network that had been expected to send hundreds of millions of dollars to Michigan to build and rehab housing across the state, insulate old homes and boost energy efficiency in factories.

Trump officials have signaled that more cancellations could be coming as they review tens of billions of dollars in clean energy funds awarded by the previous administration.

Michigan utilities, for example, are awaiting word on the status of $15 billion in clean energy-related loans announced days before Trump took office. And the Trump administration is reevaluating a grant program that awarded $500 million to retool a Lansing GM factory for electrified vehicles.

An exception to the administration’s shift of resources away from Biden-era energy policies: It has continued making disbursements from a $1.5 billion loan authorized in 2024 to support the reopening of the Palisades nuclear power plant and in December announced another $400 million to develop two new reactors at the site.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement accompanying the grant announcement.

$3 billion in canceled projects

Spurred along by federal and state subsidies and regulations that encouraged automakers to build EVs and consumers to buy them, Michigan manufacturers announced a collective $23.8 billion in new investments tied to the energy transition between 2022 and 2024, mostly related to battery or EV plants.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the trendline has reversed. Michigan saw $3 billion worth of disinvestment this year as companies scrapped planned EV factories or closed existing ones, according to the Atlas analysis.

Spokespeople for the US Department of Energy, which has overseen efforts to reprioritize fossil fuels by shifting federal resources and loosening vehicle emissions regulations, did not respond to requests for comment from Bridge Michigan.

But Trump has routinely cast EVs as a costly “scam” while downplaying the effects of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline. During a December announcement that his administration would loosen fuel economy standards applying to new vehicles, Trump cast his pro-gas policies as a win for consumers that would “protect American jobs” and shave “at least $1,000 off the price of a new car.”

The biggest EV-related cancellation is the Gotion project, a once-planned $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids that spent years embroiled in controversy before state officials declared the project dead this fall.

In that case, Rosser, the Atlas analyst, said, shifting federal policies weren’t the only factor.

“The rollback of the (Inflation Reduction Act) clean energy tax credits, softening demand for electric vehicles, and concerns about the company’s foreign ownership are all likely factors,” Rosser said.

This fall, batterymaker XALT Energy announced plans to close its Midland headquarters and an Auburn Hills facility just two years after announcing plans to spend a “double digit million sum” expanding the facility.

Automotive supplier Dana Inc., which had vowed to invest $54.2 million at an Auburn Hills EV battery plant by the end of 2024, instead announced this fall that it would close the plant amid an “unexpected and immediate reduction in customer orders driven by lower demand for electric vehicles.”

Fortescue canceled an under-construction $210 million EV charger, battery and hydrogen generator plant at the former Fisher Body site in Detroit, citing shifting US markets and policies including the loss of “critical tax credits.”

Other losses included the closure of an Akasol electric vehicle battery factory in Warren and cancelled plans to build a TS Conductor high-voltage direct current conductor plant in Erie using a since-cancelled $28 million federal grant.

TS Conductor is still building the plant, but switched locations to South Carolina after receiving what company CEO Jason Huang described as a “very generous incentive package.”

Timelines and ambitions for numerous other EV and battery factory projects in Michigan have shifted amid the changing policies and market forces. GM, for instance, sold its stake in a planned EV battery factory near Lansing to LG Energy Solution and the plant’s planned opening has been delayed from 2025 to 2026. And Ford has scaled back plans for an EV battery plant near Marshall, now slated to open in 2026.

Stevens said he expects the EV market to grow in 2026, but “it’s not going to be at the acceleration curve that a lot of people projected, and certainly the previous administration was pushing.”",https://themanchestermirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iStock-824981622-1.jpg.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 09:58:52.688705

The city of Seattle has tried its own incentive program offering up to $180,000 for Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to serve the Port of Seattle.
But while Washington state moves ahead, the federal government has looked to slow the transition.
Washington has been following the lead of California in its push toward zero-emission vehicles.
Voucher applicants can also ask for more money to install charging infrastructure, a major barrier to transitioning to zero-emission vehicles for both businesses and individuals.","Washington is close to opening a new incentive program for commercial fleet operators to transition trucks and other vehicles to models that run on electric or hydrogen power.

Industry groups and climate advocates anxiously await the $126 million initiative. But the state lawmakers who championed it say it’s taken far too long to come online.

The transportation sector is the biggest driver of Washington’s carbon emissions. Exhaust from big trucks and buses makes up a disproportionate share of those emissions, and diesel air pollution can be especially unhealthy.

To help combat this, the Washington Zero-Emission Incentive Program, or WAZIP, is expected to launch in the spring.

“We are very eager for WAZIP to launch as soon as possible,” said Leah Missik, the Washington legislative director for environmental advocacy group Climate Solutions. “We know from the experience in other states and even from the experience of people who’ve been able to get clean trucks here in Washington that this program will help drivers and businesses save money, and it will benefit communities.”

Washington has already made some progress.

In 2024, nearly one in five new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sold in Washington ran on zero-emission technology, according to the state Department of Ecology. Though the adoption rate varies depending on the type. Heavier trucks are harder to come by than, for example, electric delivery vans. Think of Amazon’s ubiquitous Rivian vans.

Heavy trucks, on the other hand, remain prohibitively expensive for many companies, while lacking public charging infrastructure, industry groups say. And they can’t go nearly as far on a charge as their diesel-fueled counterparts, not to mention they’re much heavier.

The city of Seattle has tried its own incentive program offering up to $180,000 for Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to serve the Port of Seattle. But even with that sweetener, operators found the transition still unfeasible financially.

Instead, the city in October partnered with a company called Zeem Solutions to distribute $1.5 million to drayage operators. It follows more than $5 million that the Northwest Seaport Alliance gave the company over the summer for a commercial fleet charging depot in the city of SeaTac.

But while Washington state moves ahead, the federal government has looked to slow the transition.

Washington has been following the lead of California in its push toward zero-emission vehicles. California has a unique ability to set emission rules that go further than federal guidelines, and other states can pick between the two. Washington has been following California’s stricter standards.

But Congress this year repealed California’s opportunity to set those standards. States, including Washington, have sued the federal government over the move.

One of those rules pushes manufacturers to up their sales of zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks over time. The move by Congress and approved by President Donald Trump offers a “slight ease of pressure” on the trucking industry, said Sheri Call, president and CEO of the Washington Trucking Associations.

“But it also doesn’t mean that we don’t want to continue the conversation about what industry can do today,” Call continued, “because we do have members who are motivated to reduce their carbon footprint. They just need workable solutions to do so.”

The local trucking industry is also grappling with the Trump administration’s cancellation of federal money meant to fuel a hub of hydrogen development in the region, which aimed to help develop cleaner semitrucks, among other things. Call said this is “very promising technology for the industry, especially in the heavy truck space.”

How will it work?

The WAZIP program is funded by proceeds from the state’s carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act.

It’ll offer $82 million in vouchers for on-road vehicles, $20 million for off-road equipment, like forklifts and farm equipment. It’ll also have $10 million reserved for small businesses.

For example, buyers of a zero-emission Class 4 medium-duty truck weighing between 14,001 pounds and 16,000 pounds could get $60,000 off at the point of sale, though the final voucher amounts aren’t yet finalized. The vouchers, which increase based on weight, cover electric and hydrogen fuel cell technology.

For reference, a Class 4 diesel truck costs around $60,000 while the electric version is roughly $160,000, according to John Barnes, of TEC Equipment. Diesel Class 8 trucks cost $160,000 compared to $600,000 for electrics.

Voucher applicants can also ask for more money to install charging infrastructure, a major barrier to transitioning to zero-emission vehicles for both businesses and individuals.

The hope is that trucking companies can get assistance with upfront costs to transition toward electric, then reap the benefits of reduced fuel costs over time.

“I cannot understate the importance of it in terms of hitting our climate targets, but also helping people save money over the long run,” Missik said.

Some businesses will be eligible for even more savings. They include those with under $10 million in annual revenue and those certified as an emerging or rising business by the state’s Office of Women and Minority Owned Business Enterprises. Drayage operators, veteran-owned businesses, nonprofits and public agencies also qualify.

In the Class 4 example, these purchasers could get an extra $10,000 off.

Businesses can also buy converted or used vehicles with vouchers of reduced value.

The initiative is modeled on similar efforts in California, where a truck incentive program has given out roughly 15,000 vouchers totaling over $1.6 billion in savings in the past 15 years.

Call and Missik both expect WAZIP to be very popular.

What’s taking so long?

But those leading the charge for WAZIP’s creation think it should already be up and running.

State House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, said it should’ve started up at least six months ago. His counterpart in the Senate agrees.

“The governor’s office and the Department of Transportation know that I’m not satisfied by how long it’s taken to get this done,” Fey said. “It’s beyond the point now that my patience is about done with this.”

In response, the state Department of Transportation noted “this is a complex program that WSDOT needs to ensure is developed and administered properly, because significant state resources are involved.”

“This work includes custom software to meet Washington’s unique needs,” spokesperson Barbara LaBoe said in an email. “WSDOT is working diligently to deliver the program as quickly as possible, while maintaining the high standards for compliance and usability that are required.”

Researchers from the University of California San Diego and Princeton University modeled what happens when governments combine subsidies for clean energy with taxes or fees on greenhouse gas pollution.

“This work helps make our climate models more realistic about how governments actually behave. For years, models have told us what’s economically efficient—but not what’s politically possible. Our goal is to bridge that gap so policymakers can craft strategies that survive real-world politics.” said the study’s co-author David Victor, professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and co-director of UC San Diego’s Deep Decarbonization Initiative (D2I).

Their conclusion is blunt. Incentives can drive rapid adoption of cleaner technologies early on, but without pricing for carbon and methane emissions long-term decarbonization stalls.

The work, published in Nature Climate Change, breaks new ground by simulating policy mixes that more closely resemble how governments actually behave. Most economic models still assume a single, economy-wide carbon price, even though few countries have ever adopted one. The new modeling instead tests sequences of incentives, penalties and political reversals across all 50 U.S. states through 2050.

The results suggest that stable subsidies for electric vehicles, renewable power and clean manufacturing can sharply reduce emissions in the near term by lowering costs and speeding deployment. But the biggest gains come when those carrots are later paired with sticks that make fossil fuels progressively more expensive.

Timing also matters. When incentives are delayed, repealed or restarted, investment slows and emissions cuts later become more costly. Consistent policy, the study finds, can put the energy system on track for roughly an 80% reduction in emissions by mid-century.

The findings arrive as U.S. climate policy faces renewed uncertainty. Clean energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act are under political pressure, while a federal carbon tax remains off the table. That stands in contrast to Europe, where emissions trading has steadily tightened, and China, which is expanding both clean energy subsidies and carbon pricing mechanisms.

International agencies such as the International Energy Agency have similarly warned that subsidies alone cannot deliver net-zero goals without measures that discourage continued fossil fuel use. The new research adds modeling evidence to that broader global debate, underscoring that climate success depends not just on ambition, but on durable policy design that survives real-world politics.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alex-shuper-RWcrX7RvTxc-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 08:59:15.450794

The proposal was described by trust supporters as a new and probably unconstitutional “raid” of trust funds — state lottery proceeds that are granted out to environmental projects.

A state official, meanwhile, described the transfer as necessary to continue soil and water conservation projects and said it complies with a recently amended state law that expanded the allowable uses of the money.

The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment (NDWEE), in a mid-budget funding request, seeks an $8 million transfer from the Trust, of which $6 million would be used for a soil and water conservation program and $2 million for salaries and administrative costs.

Amanda Woita, a department spokeswoman, said the transfer to the Water Resources Cash Fund complies with the goal of the Trust funds — to conserve, enhance and restore the state’s environment, and that the Trust currently holds more than $70 million, so it can “easily” afford an $8 million withdrawal. The Trust typically distributes about $20 million in lottery-funded grants each year.

“Using these funds to protect the vital groundwater and surface water resources is a clear constitutional and common-sense use of the funds allocated to the Environmental Trust,” Woita said in an email response to questions.

But Kristal Stoner, the head of Audubon Great Plains, and Sandy Scofield, a former state senator who heads the Friends of the Environmental Trust, questioned the legality of the proposed transfer.

Stoner said using one-time Trust funds to help solve a state budget problem would “erode” the Trust and its purpose, which is to provide competitive grants to local and regional organizations seeking to enhance the state’s environment.

“I am deeply concerned,” she said in an email. “Continued diversions of funds will mean the end of the Trust.”

“Nebraska should continue to fund our legal responsibilities and basics of our government with general funds,” Stoner said, and not lottery proceeds.

Tight budget times

The proposal comes when the state is wrestling with closing a gap in the state budget and as supporters of the Trust worry about raids on the grant funds.

A year ago, the Legislature allocated $15 million in Trust funds, over two years, to soil and water conservation programs overseen by the Department of Natural Resources, an agency that recently was merged into the NDWEE.

State lawmakers, though, rejected a proposal by Gov. Jim Pillen to expand the use of Trust funds to include “outdoor recreation” and “healthy infrastructure.”

The separate Water Resources Cash Fund primarily finances projects by local Natural Resources Districts to enhance stream flows and groundwater recharge in areas of concern about water resources.

When it was created, the water program was financed using state tax dollars. But since 2011, Trust funds have been transferred in some years to supplement the state water cash fund’s annual grants, which totaled $3.7 million in the most recent year, according to an October report to the Legislature.

The NDWEE, in its budget request, said the $8 million in Trust funds would allow continuation of water resources programs in areas where water has been fully or overappropriated.

In recent years, the Trust, in a departure from past practices, has built up an excess of funds by not awarding all the proceeds it gets from the Nebraska Lottery. In 2023, for instance, it granted out only $11 million of the $20 million available. In 2024, $15 million was granted out of $26 million available.

This year, grant awards of about $18 million out of the $25 million available have been recommended by a Trust subcommittee, according to Holly Adams, the Trust’s executive director. The full Nebraska Environmental Trust Board meets Jan. 8 to consider approving those awards.

According to the Legislative Fiscal Office, the Trust holds about $73 million in assets, about $27 million of which will remain unobligated, once the proposed new grants are considered. Some of the Trust’s grants are multi-year, so funds for them are already assigned to grant out in future years.

Scofield, who was chief of staff under then-Gov. Ben Nelson when the Environmental Trust was created, said lottery funds were never intended to finance the administrative expenses of state agencies. She said the current budget “mess” has been caused by the state failing to provide enough tax revenue to finance state operations.

Some have blamed cuts in state income taxes passed by the Legislature in 2023 as too deep. The cuts are projected to reduce state tax revenue by $470 million in the current fiscal year and $702 million in 2026-27. Pillen, meanwhile, has said he anticipated needing to cut state spending and says state government should be reduced. He has called for $500 million in agency cuts this year.

Legal questions continue

Supporters of the Trust, who maintain that the latest proposed transfer is illegal, point to a state statute that says that grants from the Trust “shall not provide direct assistance to regulatory programs.”

But Woita, of the NDWEE, said that is a misreading of state law, and that recent amendments for the use of the Water Resources Cash Fund clearly allow its use to cover the costs of salaries and water conservation projects.

In May, a former state official, Jon Oberg, threatened to file a lawsuit to block the proposed transfer of Trust funds to the water resources fund proposed in the 2025 legislative session.

Oberg and another former state official, W. Don Nelson, who served as chief of staff under then-Gov. Bob Kerrey, have previously successfully blocked a Trust funding decision that they maintained was unconstitutional. Their 2020 lawsuit resulted in the removal of a $1.8 million grant to install ethanol blender pumps at gas stations.

But Oberg told the Examiner on Thursday that he had no comment about the most recent proposal. The proposed $8 million transfer will be considered by the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee during the 2026 legislative session, which begins Wednesday.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47648/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tractor-1024x767-11767612933.jpeg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=jvWEmpC6,N,,2026-01-05 07:58:36.813764

Coal ash contains 26 toxins including ones that cause cancer, are heavy metals or are radioactive.
She connected with Janie Clark, whose husband had worked on the spill cleanup and died.
Waller met more spill workers and their families through a Facebook group.
Coal ash, she said, despite current talk of reviving the coal industry, is “definitely not safe” and that moving it around will “contaminate everywhere.” She and Clark talk at least once per week.","Seventeen years have passed since a massive rupture at a Tennessee Valley Authority plant spilled more than 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash into Harriman, Tenn., but the event is still raw in Jessica Waller’s mind.

Waller’s father, Ernest Hickman, a union contractor for Jacobs Engineering Group, worked on cleanup of the spill.

Hickman died of emphysema, which Waller attributes to his contact with the ash over a six-year cleanup period — specifically beryllium, a naturally occurring metal used in the nuclear, automotive and aerospace industries, and arsenic, which is used in metal, technology and some medical uses.

Both are present in coal fly ash and are highly toxic.

She believes her mother, Patsy Hickman, also got ill from exposure after washing her husband’s clothes and other activities putting her in contact with the ash, causing her death of respiratory failure.

“It’s sad to know there’s a lot of people even here in Tennessee in the area who have no idea about the coal ash spill,” Waller said. “Or they do but they didn’t know the extent of the devastation that it caused, especially health-wise of making so many people sick.”

Lunches on the coal ash

A dike at the Kingston Fossil Plant broke on the morning of Dec. 22, 2008, releasing 5.4 million cubic yards, or 1.1 billion gallons, of wet ash stored in the pond behind it.

The ash, a byproduct of burning coal, spilled as sludge into the Swan Pond Embayment and Emory River and covered 300 acres, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Ernest Hickman was one of the first workers cleaning up the site, just one or two days after the spill. Hickman, Waller said, first worked in the spilled ash sludge keeping pumps running to suck it up. Later he shoveled it around to different locations including rail cars. His last month there was in April 2014 when the spill material “finally got from the mush to dust,” Waller said.

Coal ash contains 26 toxins including ones that cause cancer, are heavy metals or are radioactive. The workers’ training materials mentioned risks from arsenic and silica but not other risks from other materials like lead, cobalt, uranium, radium, lithium or molybdenum.

Waller said Jacobs didn’t allow respirators or masks and gave false information.

“(Workers) were told that you could eat a pound of it a day and it not even hurt you,” she said.

TVA footed the bill for workers to have luncheons at tables underneath tents “right on the coal ash.” Wind, Waller said, blew the dust around, getting it in their food and drink.

“That’s because they trusted them,” she said of why the workers ate at these lunches. “And that trust was broken.”

“He would come home with his nose full of white stuff,” Waller said of her father during the ash cleanup. “He’d be coughing up black stuff.”

Jacobs Engineering settles Kingston coal ash case

Both of her parents, Waller said, started developing respiratory illnesses in the years after the cleanup, followed by her mother’s cardiovascular issues. She said her mother fell ill in 2014 and her father in 2016 and that their symptoms such as mini strokes “mimicked each other.”

“They got to where they couldn’t walk,” she said. “They couldn’t talk.”

She got her father a sippy cup so that he could still enjoy Pepsi.

Ernest Hickman began “falling all the time.” Waller quit her job and delayed going back to school to be a licensed practical nurse to focus on caring for her parents instead.

Ernest Hickman died on Dec. 4, 2016, and Patsy Hickman on Sept. 19, 2018. They were in their 50s; other Jacobs workers who died were younger.

“Question everything.”

“This was all covered in the ash,” she said in December, pointing to soccer fields near a historic marker in Swan Pond Sports Complex at the former spill site.

Close to the 17th anniversary, Waller placed her parents’ portraits next to another nearby monument, a cross meant to represent those including her parents, killed by toxins.

She is still worried about contaminants still in nearby bodies of water, and her grief flares near the holidays.

“I do have a hard time with Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Waller said. She still decorates a tree on Nov. 1 like her mother, whose favorite holiday was Christmas, did.

She remembers her father making drawings using his computer’s “basic paint program,” including one that included an image of the Earth describing Jacobs and another company, Bechtel, as doing “environmental cleanup around the globe.”

Waller didn’t conclude the ash was a cause for her parents’ illness until after her mother’s death. Then she went on a “binge” of research on ash toxins. She connected with Janie Clark, whose husband had worked on the spill cleanup and died.

Waller met more spill workers and their families through a Facebook group. She compared her parents’ experience to that of others and then checked with doctors who’d treated other workers.

She said she got compensation from a lawsuit filed against Jacobs, settled in 2018 — Jacobs appealed the decision until 2023 — although she said the plaintiffs were “let down” by how long it took. Since then she’s told her story as a way to handle her grief he’s told her story for two years which she said helped her handle her grief for her parents and anger at TVA and Jacobs.

Waller said she hoped people could learn to be more skeptical of people in power and big corporations.

“Question everything,” she said, adding she likes to get second opinions in her nursing work.

Coal ash, she said, despite current talk of reviving the coal industry, is “definitely not safe” and that moving it around will “contaminate everywhere.”

T1 Energy Investment Narrative Recap

To own T1 Energy today, you need to believe its U.S. manufacturing footprint, tax-credit eligibility, and FEOC-compliant supply chain can turn current losses and heavy capex into a durable, policy-aligned solar platform. The Treaty Oak agreement and recent foreign ownership clean-up both support the short term catalyst of securing bankable offtake for G2_Austin, while also partially addressing the biggest near term risk around maintaining access to U.S. clean energy incentives.

Among recent developments, the December 2025 follow on equity raise of US$140,000,009 stands out alongside the Treaty Oak deal, because it underlines how capital formation is being paired with long term, policy-compliant contracts to support G2_Austin’s build-out and mitigate liquidity and execution risk on T1’s expansion plans.

The past year marked a significant expansion of programming for older youth. Through a multi-year, $2.5 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc., awarded as part of the Fostering Character Through Children’s Museums initiative, the institution is formally “aging up” its offerings.

That effort has already launched a Teen Mentoring Program expected to serve nearly 500 youth, with the museum recently marking the graduation of its first teen cohort. Planning is also underway for a new 800-square-foot exhibit designed specifically for children ages 8 to 14.

Education and workforce experts increasingly point to early adolescence as a critical window for developing the skills that shape long-term employment outcomes, including communication, problem-solving, teamwork and decision-making.

Programs that engage youth between ages 8 and 14 have been shown to strengthen persistence, social-emotional learning and exposure to career pathways which are all factors employers and educators cite as foundational to future workforce readiness. By expanding programming for teens and “tweens,” LCM is positioning its youth initiatives as part of the broader talent-development pipeline that supports regional economic resilience.

Expanding Health Support

LCM also entered into an exclusive healthcare partnership with Manning Family Children’s as part of a broader effort to expand health and wellness programming for children and families across the region.

The collaboration has integrated healthcare services and expertise into the museum’s campus during special events and its Helis Foundation Art for All Days, which offer free, community-focused access to museum programming.

Through the partnership, families have been able to access immunizations, health screenings and gun safety resources, along with parenting education through the museum’s Parenting Center and mental health care coordination via ThriveKids.

“From launching new health resources to securing a first-of-its-kind character education grant for teens, we have continued to deliver on our legacy of nurturing the minds and bodies of children across our region,” said Tifferney White, CEO of the Louisiana Children’s Museum.

Signature and Community Programming

Beyond its health and youth-development initiatives, the museum continues to expand its slate of community-facing programs throughout 2025.

Recent programming has included MEOWseum Discovery Days tied to Gabby’s Dollhouse, sustainability-focused activities during Environmental Rescue with characters from PAW Patrol, sponsored by Cox Communications, and Earn & Learn, a financial literacy day supported by the Louisiana Society of CPAs and a private donor. Signature events such as Mud Fest, Kindergarten Kickoff and Noon Year’s Eve also returned during the year.

As the museum looks ahead, White said 2026 will mark a milestone moment for the institution.

“Next year marks the 40th anniversary of the Louisiana Children’s Museum,” White said. “We can’t wait to celebrate four decades of exploration, learning and memories as we continue our mission of serving Louisiana’s families.”

North Dakota Monitor reporter Michael Achterling contributed to this story.","Federal policies on health care and trade are likely to continue to color North Dakota’s biggest government stories in 2026. Congress and the Trump administration are spending money in an attempt to help the rural health care system and farm economy to offset cuts to Medicaid and declining ag commodity prices.

It’s also an election year, featuring ballot measures and a U.S. House race in North Dakota. And the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library plans its grand opening in conjunction with the nation’s milestone 250th anniversary.

Special session

Gov. Kelly Armstrong has set Jan. 21 as the date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding that was part of what Republicans called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in 2025.

North Dakota was awarded $199 million after applying for its share of the federal funding. One North Dakota policy change prompted by the competition for federal funding was prohibiting the use of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy candy and junk food. The new restrictions are expected to be implemented by September 2026.

North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

North Dakota’s application for funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program focused on four areas: workforce; preventive care and healthy eating; bringing high-quality health care closer to home; and improving health care technology.

Once lawmakers gather at the Capitol, they could propose bills addressing other issues. But legislative leaders have said they plan to limit the scope of the session, and rules require that a two-thirds majority in each chamber must agree that the topic should be considered.

Election

North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat and a potential statewide vote on making school meals free for students are likely to be the top races in 2026, but there are many more. More than half of the Legislature’s seats are up for election, and there are local races for seats on school boards, judgeships and other positions.

U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a Republican in her first term, plans to run for reelection and has already received President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Republican Alex Balazs, who came in fourth out of five candidates in the 2024 primary but received the state party endorsement, has announced plans to challenge Fedorchak.

Other statewide offices — all held by Republicans — on the 2026 ballot are secretary of state, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, tax commissioner and two seats on the Public Service Commission.

The statewide nonpartisan offices up for election are the Superintendent of Public Instruction and two seats on the state Supreme Court.

In the Legislature, odd-numbered districts are on the ballot and two even-numbered districts, 26 and 42, have elections for House seats. The primary is June 9.

North Dakotans may be voting on state funding for school breakfasts and lunches, something the 2025 Legislature voted down. Organizers still need to turn in signatures to get the issue on the general election ballot.

Voters will consider during the primary election a ballot measure to require all proposed amendments to the state constitution to comprise a single subject.

The Legislature also approved putting two measures on the 2026 general election ballot. Measure 1 proposes to make changes to term limits voters approved in 2022. The measure would allow lawmakers to serve up to 16 years in one chamber and clarifies that a partial term does not count toward the limit. Measure 2 would require that 60% of voters approve a measure instead of a simple majority.

Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library

The grand opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is set for July 4 in Medora, coinciding with the 250th birthday of the United States.

All living presidents are invited to the grand opening, said Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation. However, they may not attend on the opening weekend and instead arrange a time to see the library before the year ends.

President Trump has not confirmed whether he will attend the library opening, Briney said. July 1 is highlighted on a national calendar of 250th events to celebrate the library’s grand opening.

Members of Theodore Roosevelt’s family are planning to camp in the area during the opening weekend, and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who is also a library foundation board member, plans on attending the library opening, according to Briney. Among public officials expected to attend is Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who championed the library project as North Dakota governor.

The state has high hopes for attracting more tourists to the town of fewer than 200 people with the museum dedicated to Roosevelt, who ranched in the Badlands before becoming revered as one of America’s greatest presidents.

Energy

As the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, North Dakota relies on oil and gas taxes for more than half of its revenue. Production has held relatively steady, though the price of oil is struggling to stay above the level forecast by the state.

North Dakota oil production resilient even as prices have declined

Industry observers will be watching to see if a couple of carbon dioxide gas sequestration projects — Minnkota Power’s Project Tundra and the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline — will move forward.

Sequestration is permanent underground storage of the greenhouse gas. Minnkota would sequester CO2 from a coal-fired power plant while Summit would gather CO2 from ethanol plants in five states, including one in North Dakota. While in the works for years, construction has not started on either project. Summit, which has faced regulatory challenges, has indicated the possibility of changing the pipeline route, but also has said a North Dakota storage area “remains an important long-term asset for the project.”

Meanwhile, hearings on a controversial high-voltage transmission line are coming up in January. There is high interest in a pipeline to bring natural gas from western North Dakota to the east, though construction won’t start until 2028. There could also be headwinds for wind and solar energy as the Trump administration cuts incentives for green energy projects.

Potential efforts to extract critical minerals from coal, lawmakers’ study of nuclear energy’s feasibility in the state and the ongoing discussion surrounding data centers are also likely to be major energy topics in 2026.

Agriculture

The farm economy took a beating in 2025, and 2026 isn’t looking so good, either. A major factor will be export markets. China has been a key importer of North Dakota soybeans in years past but did little buying in 2025.

Depressed prices for soybeans and other crops coaxed the Trump administration into aid payments for farmers, which should arrive in February. Former North Dakota Farmers Union leader Mark Watne questioned whether those payments would be enough to keep farmers afloat.

Construction will continue in 2026 on two giant milking operations for Minnesota-based Riverview in the Red River Valley. There is a lawsuit pending against the state for its permitting of the Herberg Dairy near Hillsboro and other legal challenges to the Abercrombie Dairy north of Wahpeton.

Beef production was the bright spot for North Dakota agriculture in 2025, and despite some ups and downs, could be again in 2026 as consumer demand remains strong despite higher prices.

Looking ahead If I had to summarize India’s BESS story in 2025, I’d put it this way: The “why” is settled – we know storage is essential to absorb 500 GW of non-fossil capacity reliably.","India’s battery storage landscape is undergoing a decisive transformation in 2025. Across utilities, regulators, and developers, BESS has moved beyond early-stage exploration and is increasingly recognized as an essential component for grid stability, renewable integration, and long-term energy planning.

Storage moves from pilots to the middle of the grid-planning table

Over the past 18–24 months, storage has shifted from small pilots to multi-GWh tenders. Recent auctions from central and state utilities—including SECI’s hybrid and FDRE (firm and dispatchable renewable energy) bids, Rajasthan’s large standalone BESS tender, and emerging state-level procurements—clearly position storage as a mainstream asset class rather than an experiment.

At the same time, policymakers have started to hard-wire BESS into India’s long-term planning. CEA’s optimal generation mix studies indicate a need for tens of gigawatts of BESS capacity by 2029–30 to support the 500 GW non-fossil target.

From a supplier’s perspective, this is changing the nature of discussions with utilities and IPPs. We’re now talking about storage as an integral part of round-the-clock and peak-power portfolios, not as a separate “add-on” box at the substation fence.

This signals India’s transition from policy-driven trials to commercially meaningful, multi-GWh annual deployments over the next 3–5 years.

Rapidly improving economics and smarter business models

The cost story is equally important. In just a couple of years, market-discovered prices in utility BESS tenders have fallen sharply, with the most recent auctions in Rajasthan setting new national benchmarks for storage charges per MW/month.

On the policy side, the central government’s Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for BESS has been recalibrated as costs fall—the per-MWh support ceiling has been reduced significantly compared to early estimates, reflecting actual market-price movement.

For developers, this is pushing a shift towards:

Revenue stacking – combining capacity, peak shifting, ancillary services, and sometimes behind-the-meter use.

Hybrid portfolios – where the economics of solar + storage + occasionally wind are evaluated together, not in silos.

These price dynamics indicate a steady movement toward commercially viable storage even with reduced subsidies.

Technology is maturing from “boxes” to fully integrated systems

Technologically, India has moved beyond asking, “Which battery chemistry?” to “How do we run this as a reliable, grid-interactive system for 15–20 years?”

A few clear directions are visible:

LFP and ACC dominance at the front line of grid-scale deployments, driven by safety, cycle life, and economics.

Multi-MW PCS platforms that are battery-technology independent, with DC voltages up to 1500 V and round-trip efficiencies in the high-90s.

Fully integrated BESS – combining PCS, EMS, BMS, fire safety, thermal management, and communication in one engineered system rather than stitched-together components. Delta’s containerized BESS, for example, offers 150 kVA–5.5 MVA power with configurable 300 kWh–~5 MWh energy, grid-forming controls, and black-start capability for utility, C&I, and EV-infrastructure applications.

Equally, safety and reliability are now boardroom topics. That means designing for multi-level protection such as module-level BMS, integrated fire suppression, outdoor-rated enclosures and testing the whole system as a single product, not a collection of parts.

AI-enabled EMS, predictive analytics, and advanced fleet monitoring are emerging as key differentiators for performance and lifecycle optimization.

Use-cases diversifying well beyond “renewables plus four-hour storage”

Grid-scale renewable integration will naturally stay the primary driver, but in 2025 we’re seeing BESS value being unlocked in multiple segments:

Thermal-plant flexibility: India has begun piloting storage at coal plants to reduce ramping stress and better absorb mid-day solar, with NTPC leading large tenders at thermal sites.

Rail and metro networks: Our own experience in deploying BESS with advanced-chemistry cells on the Kolkata Metro corridor – providing backup traction power and improving resilience – is a good example of non-traditional, high-reliability use cases.

C&I and building-level storage: We increasingly see factories and commercial buildings using storage for peak shaving, diesel mitigation, and PV self-consumption where grid tariffs justify it.

EV and data center ecosystems: High-power DC chargers and hyperscale data centers both place sharp, localised demands on the grid. Hybrid nodes that combine renewables, BESS and EV charging—supported by an EMS—are gaining traction, particularly as India’s EV and digital infrastructure expands.

From my perspective, this diversification is healthy. It spreads risk, builds operational experience across different duty cycles, and encourages more innovation in control algorithms and asset management.

This diversification reinforces BESS as a core component of national energy and infrastructure planning.

“Make in India” and partnerships are reshaping the supply chain

Finally, you can’t talk about India’s BESS future without talking about localization. Between the national framework for energy storage, VGF support, and parallel programs for domestic cell manufacturing, policy clearly signals that storage should not be entirely import-dependent in the long run.

We see three big shifts here: Local manufacturing scale-up, co-development with Indian partners, and designing for Indian conditions, exporting globally.

In simple terms, storage is no longer just about adding batteries; it’s about building a resilient, intelligent infrastructure layer that supports everything from rural feeders and metros to hyperscale data centers and EV highways.

These policy and industry signals show that India sees storage as a long-term strategic sector requiring domestic value creation, not import dependency.

Looking ahead

If I had to summarize India’s BESS story in 2025, I’d put it this way:

The “why” is settled – we know storage is essential to absorb 500 GW of non-fossil capacity reliably.

The “how much” is clearer – multi-GWh targets and tenders give the industry a visibility it didn’t have two years ago.

The “how exactly” is where innovation is exploding – in system design, business models, AI-driven EMS, and localized manufacturing.

They offer domestic value creation, often directly at the local level and help free us from dependencies created by energy politics. In addition, renewables leave other energy sources behind in terms of power generation costs. They are not only central to climate action but also help stabilise Germany economically and increase its resilience to external shocks.

How would you generally rate the performance of the coalition government of chancellor Friedrich Merz in energy and climate policy so far? Where do you see promising approaches – and where do you identify notable shortcomings?

The recently adopted Economic Promotion Act for Germany, which is supposed to steer investments into renewable energy, is a good signal in my opinion, much like the commitments to faster planning and licensing set out in the Infrastructure of the Future Act. Apart from that, I welcome the fact that policymakers have begun to understand that grids, storage systems, and energy generation must be thought of as one integrated system.

At the same time, a clear signal from the government that the current expansion path for renewables will be resolutely continued is still lacking. One example for this is the mobility sector, where we would wish to see a clearer commitment to decarbonisation. A transformation as profound as the one that the German auto industry is faced with needs a reliable political framework. In Germany, the focus is largely set on protecting the status quo. This consumes resources needed for the necessary investment in future-oriented structures, which in turn makes it hard to safeguard value creation, jobs, and technological leadership in the area of renewable propulsion technologies in the long term.

The actions of the crew, plus other logistical challenges and weather conditions, led to the ship eventually blocking around 30% of the world’s container traffc. “What starts out small – the decision of a ship’s captain or the mutation of a virus – can sometimes cascade into global consequences,” he says.

But what if it were possible to harness the power of positive tipping points?

“Instead of turning away from the complexity and enormity of the climate crisis,” he says, “we need to understand how tipping points can self-propel change. That way we can truly appreciate the risks we are facing and find the agency to accelerate the changes that can get us out of trouble.”

History is full of examples. The suffragettes, for instance who, through protests and acts of civil disobedience, eventually tipped mass public opinion in favour of their cause.

More recently, Greta Thunberg’s School Strike for Climate demonstrates how the acts of a solo schoolgirl sitting outside the Swedish parliament ballooned into a global campaign.

Here are four more positive tipping points that have already reached mass adoption, or have the potential to in time.

1. Norway: streets ahead with EV adoption

Norway is about nine years ahead of the global car market in its tipping to EVs, says Lenton. Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, market share is 90% in the Scandinavian country. This is thanks to policy and financial incentives that were in part triggered by a group of activists – the frontman of pop band A-ha, Morten Harket, among them – who campaigned in the 80s and 90s to get the government to remove barriers to EV adoption.

“Norway’s leadership in being the first country to reach an EV tipping point is important for all of us, because driving cars is currently responsible for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions,” says Lenton.

Norway was the first country to reach an EV tipping point

2. The UK and Denmark have tipped away from coal power

In September 2024, the last coal-burning power station in the UK closed, signalling the final nail in the coffin for dirty energy in the country. Several policy changes contributed to making the tipping point to green power irreversible, including a 2013 carbon tax on emissions generated in the power sector. At the same time renewable energy capacity in the grid was growing exponentially. “Profitable coal plants became loss-making overnight,” explains Lenton.

Today, over half of the UK’s power comes from renewables. It’s a similar story in Denmark, which produces 60% of the country’s power from wind. Meanwhile, solar PV has reached a positive tipping point globally, with panels falling in cost by more than 90% in the last decade.

“As solar and wind power continue to get cheaper, the economics are swinging inexorably in their favour,” says Lenton.

The UK and Denmark are leading the way in tipping away from coal

3. Green hydrogen: the fuel with positive potential

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis, a process where renewables-powered electricity is used to split water molecules. This fuel, and its derivative green ammonia, can be used in a multitude of industrial sectors, from shipping and steel production to aviation and agriculture.

Although we are a few decades off from reaching a positive tipping point for a green hydrogen economy, “exponential growth is already under way,” says Lenton.

China leads, with about half of the global installed production capacity. Europe, meanwhile, has set a target for green hydrogen to meet at least 42% of existing hydrogen demand by 2030. And in the US, the inflation reduction act offers a substantial tax credit to green hydrogen producers.

While it will require a “heroic effort” to scale up green hydrogen production, the positive tipping point to renewable energy is continually making the fuel more affordable.

4. Plant-based diets hold the key to nature regeneration

There is no ‘one size fits all’ positive tipping point for nature and farming, explains Lenton. What is universal, however, is the key underlying cause of the destruction of nature: diets.

Alt-proteins are at an earlier stage of adoption than other positive tipping points, but peak meat consumption has been reached in some countries

High meat consumption is still the status quo in most countries, but there are encouraging signs of change. “Peak meat consumption has been reached in some rich countries, including New Zealand, Canada and Switzerland,” he says, and investment in alternative proteins has “grown exponentially”. Alt-proteins such as plant-based substitutes and foods made from precision fermentation are still at an earlier stage of mass adoption than green hydrogen. “To displace conventional animal products, alternative proteins need to become more attractive, affordable and accessible to us consumers.”

Positive Tipping Points, by Tim Lenton, is out now, and is published by Oxford University Press.

Reconductoring existing US transmission lines with advanced conductors could save consumers $85 billion across the next decade, while quadrupling the current rate of transmission capacity expansion.","As skyrocketing demand, rising energy prices, and the urgent need for modernization challenge power grids, advanced conductors are emerging front and center on regulators’ desks.

Stakes are high: 70% of transmission lines are 25+ years old, many nearing the end of their useful life. America’s grids are reaching a tipping point, and regulators recognize the risks of letting infrastructure decay.

Advanced conductors offer a way forward. They alleviate congestion, lower costs, and increase resilience against extreme weather — the pain points of a modern grid.

With American tech giants building new data centers and our manufacturing sector undergoing a rebirth, demand will continue to surge. New policies are critical to accelerating the shift to advanced conductors, and ultimately, grids that meet 21st century energy needs.

Why Regulators are Turning to Advanced Conductors

US grids face the perfect storm. In the past two years, FERC’s 5-year peak demand forecast has grown 5x. Meanwhile, extreme weather is increasing blackout risk, costing the US economy $28–$169 billion annually.

Our infrastructure can’t keep up. Transmission capacity is expanding at less than 1% per year — far short of the 4-7% annual growth needed — driving $11.5 billion in congestion costs in 2023 alone, expenses ultimately passed to consumers.

Advanced conductors address multiple problems. They boost capacity on existing lines and resilience against extreme weather while keeping ratepayers’ bills affordable. As pressure mounts, regulators across state and federal governments are embracing them as a practical path forward.

Federal Action Paving the Way

At the federal level, the December 2025 High-Capacity Grid Act will “modernize America’s transmission system by requiring the use of best-available transmission conductors for new interstate transmission lines and rebuilds.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is also making strides, issuing Order 1920 in 2024 to improve regional transmission planning and cost allocation, requiring operators to consider grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as advanced conductors.

The DOE is also spearheading progress. Its $10.5 billion Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program allocated over $600 million in 2024 to bolster grid resilience across states affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. This funding includes the use of advanced conductors.

Such sweeping federal action sends a powerful signal to grid operators and the market.

States Leading by Example

Across state lines, local governments are leading the charge. Montana’s 2023 HB 729, offers a higher rate of return for advanced conductors.

In 2024, momentum grew:

Virginia and Minnesota passed laws requiring utilities to consider GETs, including advanced conductors, in integrated resource plans (IRPs)

California enacted SB 1006, requiring utilities to assess which lines can be reconductored with advanced conductors.

Massachusetts passed S.2967, mandating that utilities consider Advanced Transmission Technologies (ATTs), including advanced conductors, in new transmission projects.

These states triggered a legislative snowball effect throughout 2025:

Utah signed HB 212, creating a framework to accelerate the evaluation and deployment of GETs.

Indiana passed SB 422, requiring utilities to evaluate GETs in IRPs.

South Carolina signed H 3309, requiring utilities to include a detailed transmission planning report in IRPs, suggesting technologies like advanced conductors. South Carolina is also home to a new advanced conductor manufacturing facility, announced March 2025.

Maryland passed SB 937, mandating that new transmission projects use advanced transmission or GETs.

Connecticut passed SB 4, requiring ATTs in Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) applications. Utilities must also report on their compliance.

As of late 2025, 20+ US states have passed or are advancing legislation related to GETs or ATTs, with at least 10 enacting new laws in 2025 alone.

How Advanced Conductors Provide Relief

A shift is underway, and for good reason. Advanced conductors directly address the concerns driving regulatory action. They enhance grid resilience against modern challenges, plus their high-strength, low-sag cores make them more resistant to heavy loads of winter ice and reduce sag in summer heat, mitigating wildfire risk.

AECC conductors offer additional advantages. They can be installed using familiar tools and techniques, simplifying installation for line crews and streamlining grid modernization.

For capacity expansion, advanced conductors excel in reconductoring projects. These projects can be completed in a fraction of the time it takes to build a new transmission line, with transmission capacity of that leg growing by 2–3x.

The economics are compelling. Reconductoring existing US transmission lines with advanced conductors could save consumers $85 billion across the next decade, while quadrupling the current rate of transmission capacity expansion.

WFDD listener John Swain recently asked how the city earned this distinction and whether it still has the recognition. For this week’s Carolina Curious, reporter DJ Simmons spoke with Greensboro Director of Transportation Hanna Cockburn to learn more.

The League of American Bicyclists is a national organization dedicated to improving riding conditions for cyclists throughout the country. The nonprofit designates some municipalities as bicycle-friendly communities.

Cockburn says cities are recognized by improving conditions for bicycling through policies, infrastructure and education programs. Greensboro first received its designation in 2009.

“I've personally lived in Greensboro for nearly 30 years, and I can say, from my own perspective, that the environment for cycling, and the support for cycling continues to grow and has really improved over that time,” she says.

Cockburn says some of the city’s improvements include investing in its greenway system and its Safe Routes to School Program that educates young people on safe cycling.

“The way we think about it is a network of interconnected systems that serve pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders all together,” she says.

Cockburn says the recognition solidifies the work the city has done to improve conditions for bicycling.

“It extends beyond our greenways and is reflected in the bike lane configurations that we have installed as we are able to through the resurfacing process,"" she says. ""So, I think it's a real feather in our cap.”

The past year has seen baking heat, water shortages, wildfires, flooding and storms, so what must be done to weather the effects of climate breakdown and bring a brighter, greener future for Scots and communities across the world?

It has been a turbulent year for the environment, from severe weather like never before, to rising misinformation over the climate crisis and political rollbacks on measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Weather-wise, 2025 is expected to rank in the world’s top three warmest years since records began, with this summer the hottest ever known. It continues the trend where all of the hottest years in history have taken place in the past decade, with rising temperatures driven largely by use of fossil fuels.

This warming has brought everything from blizzards, tornadoes and floods to droughts, heatwaves, wildfires and tropical cyclones across the globe.

Scotland and the UK have not escaped the effects, with a long dry period sparking water shortages and resulting in the worst harvest some farmers have ever experienced. Numerous massive wildfires cause damage on an unprecedented scale, with outbreaks in Dava and Carrbridge the largest the country has ever seen.

Internationally, rapid melting of the Arctic ice cap continues – it is now the smallest ever recorded, with consequences for the rest of the planet.

However, despite the mounting ‘physical proof’ of climate change, misinformation has also increased, and political consensus on what to do about it has rarely seemed so fragmented.

The cost of living has continued to rise, with many more households pushed into fuel poverty due to rocketing energy bills – driven by volatile global oil and gas prices.

Meanwhile, Scotland’s workforce is suffering due to lack of support and planning to achieve a just transition for businesses and workers to move from dependency on fossil fuels to a low-carbon society.

North Sea workers are being axed in droves as oil and gas supplies continue to dwindle, with reports of 13,000 jobs linked to the petroleum sector lost in the past 12 months – including hundreds due to the closure of Scotland’s only refinery, at Grangemouth, and the Mossmorran petrochemical plant in Fife. At the same time there has been criticism that support for promised green jobs has failed to materialise, although Westminster has now pledged £120 million to rescue some operations at Grangemouth.

Green goals

Over the past year there have been several notable moments that will influence the direction of travel for emissions-reduction goals.

Environmental campaigners have welcomed progress towards phasing out fossil fuels, with the UK government’s recently announced ban on exploration and development of new oil and gas wells. Retention of the so-called windfall tax, a levy on profits generated though factors outside a business’s control – in this case high petroleum prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – has also been commended.

Less well-received moves include the Scottish Government putting its long-awaited Heat in Buildings Bill formally on hold. And there has been criticism of a lack of forward travel on cutting emissions from transport, one of the biggest sources of pollution, with the goal to cut car use by 20% by 2030 dropped.

Worldwide, there have been some wins for the environment.

In July, a landmark ruling from the International Court of justice, the world’s highest court, found nations have obligations to act on climate change and cleared the way for legal action where they fail to do so.

Wind, solar and other renewable power generation overtook coal as the world’s leading source of electricity in the past 12 months, with major expansion in China responsible for much of the growth.

Looking ahead to 2026

So, as 2025 draws to a close, what action should be taken in the new year?

Members of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland (SCCS), a coalition of more than 70 groups from across all sectors of society, have come up with a list of five no-brainers that would drive forward climate action, provide jobs and help “transform the world into a cleaner, healthier and fairer place”.

1. The Scottish Government must produce a robust and effective Climate Change Plan to reap maximum benefits for people and the planet.

SCCS chair Dr Mike Robinson said: “In 2026 a new Climate Change Plan will be finalised – a huge opportunity to change life for the better for millions of Scots and help communities across the world at the same time.

“It must contain strong measures that create energy-efficient homes, better and cleaner transport systems and support for farmers to shift to nature-and-climate-friendly practices. These will also lower bills, safeguard livelihoods, improve public health and boost the economy.”

2. Scotland must support and drive community-owned renewable energy to bring maximum benefits and control to people living nearby.

“The move away from fossil fuels and to renewable energy is vital, but too many people across Scotland feel like the energy transition is being done ‘to them’ not ‘with them’,” said Liz Murray, policy manager for Community Energy Scotland.

“The renewables revolution is generating vast profits, but much of that is being extracted out of Scotland.

“Community-owned renewable energy brings income directly into local neighbourhoods. This income is then used for an array of things that benefit people living there, such as insulating homes, providing community transport, setting up local businesses and creating community gardens – and bringing jobs that go with those things.

“We need politicians to remove the obstacles and smooth the way to greater community ownership of Scotland’s vast renewable energy resources so that everyone can benefit.”

3. Plans to drill major new oil and gas wells in the North Sea must be permanently cancelled to avoid millions of tonnes of climate-warming emissions, and workers must get proper support to move into safe green jobs.

Rosie Hampton, oil and gas campaigns manager at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “Oil and gas are costing us the earth, from sky-high energy bills to mounting impacts of extreme weather from Arthur’s Seat to Indonesia.

“Our energy future must be built on renewables that are affordable and run in the public interest. Opening new fields like Rosebank would undermine the energy transition and divert time and resources away from creating decent green jobs with a long-term future.”

4. Scotland must introduce a tax on private jets.

Jamie Livingstone, head of Oxfam Scotland, said: “Private jets are one of the dirtiest forms of transport, yet thousands of private flights take off and land at Scottish airports every year, streaking our skies with a trail of pointless pollution while the rest of us bear the climate cost in floods, heatwaves and disrupted lives.

“Introducing a Scottish private jet tax in 2026 is a no-brainer: it could raise tens of millions for fair climate action, paid for by those doing the most damage.

“It’s time for the Scottish Government to end its holding pattern and make 2026 the year in which the ultra-wealthy’s free licence to pollute is finally revoked.”

5. Compensation must be secured for developing countries suffering the biggest impacts of climate change but have contributed least to warming.

Ben Wilson, director of public engagement for Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and international policy lead for SCCS, said: “Climate justice funding is a no-brainer in 2026, especially as the Commonwealth Games comes to Glasgow.

“Commonwealth countries like Bangladesh, Malawi and Fiji, and many of the world’s other poorest nations, are already being devastated by the impacts of climate change. They didn’t cause this crisis. They didn’t economically benefit from this crisis. But they are suffering first and worst for it.

“Richer nations must stump up cash for their atmospheric vandalism to help communities on the climate frontlines.”

Action stations

Scots will be watching closely as political parties put together their manifestos for the Holyrood election in late spring, with action on poverty, energy and jobs expected to be among key concerns for voters.

One thing is certain, though, no matter the result of the election in May. With around a third of current parliamentarians stepping down, there will be a large cohort of new MSPs to engage with on climate issues.

SCCS is calling for strong national action on climate and nature.

Better protection for the communities most at risk from the impacts of climate breakdown is also necessary, to help safeguard people and livelihoods.

“There is more that unites us than divides us,” said Dr Robinson.

“We all want the same basic things – a world that is safe, healthy, bountiful and fair, with a bright future for generations to come.

“And all this is achievable with urgent, strong climate action.

As investors and observers ask ""why solar stocks are down today,"" the short answer is that a convergence of policy headlines, financing pressure, supply-demand dynamics and regional regulatory actions compressed near-term economics across developers, installers and manufacturers. This article explains the proximate news triggers and the structural drivers, cites market moves and analyst responses, and outlines near-term catalysts to watch. It is factual and neutral in tone; it does not provide investment advice.

As of Jun 17, 2025, according to Reuters, a U.S. Senate draft proposing an accelerated phase-out of certain solar tax credits triggered a sharp selloff in many U.S.-listed solar names and ETFs. As of May 22–23, 2025, Yahoo Finance and other outlets reported House tax-and-spending language that also weighed on project economics. Later regional reports (including a Dec 8, 2025 note covered by Trade Brains) show how local regulatory rumors produced similar volatility in other markets such as India.

What you will learn: the immediate catalysts that moved markets, why policy timing and interest rates matter to solar projects, which segments are most exposed, and the realistic near-term scenarios that could stabilize or further pressure solar equities.

Immediate catalysts for recent declines

When people search for why solar stocks are down today, they are usually reacting to recent headline events that removed or reduced a key support for project returns: tax credits and other incentives. Two headline items dominated the moves in mid‑2025.

As of Jun 17, 2025, Reuters and BNNBloomberg reported that a Senate Finance Committee draft proposed phasing down components of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean-energy tax credits earlier than previously scheduled. Markets reacted sharply that day.

In May 2025 (May 22–23), coverage of House tax-and-spending bill language indicated more aggressive rollbacks or tighter eligibility rules that would reduce the value of investment/production tax incentives for new solar projects. That earlier coverage had already begun to reprice expectations for installation growth and developer revenue.

These legislative and committee-level items are immediate catalysts: the headline risk directly reduces the expected net present value of projects that rely on credits, which in turn compresses valuations for developers, installers, and — to a degree — some manufacturers reliant on near-term demand.

When traders and portfolio managers re-evaluated cash-flow models, many moved rapidly from higher multiple, policy‑sensitive names into cash or less-exposed sectors, producing the large intraday moves that drew attention.

Why headlines matter now

Solar project economics are often calculated with assumed tax-credit treatment, timelines to complete construction (to qualify), and expected electricity prices or offtake contracts. When a credible legislative draft shortens the timeline or shrinks credit rates, expected revenues drop and the value of projects under development falls — sometimes by a material percentage — prompting immediate stock revaluations.

U.S. legislative developments (House & Senate tax‑credit proposals)

A major reason investors are asking why solar stocks are down today is legislative risk in the U.S. that directly affects the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit structure.

As of May 22–23, 2025, multiple reports (Yahoo Finance and broader press coverage) described House-passed tax-and-spending bill language that rolled back certain clean-energy tax credits or tightened eligibility. That coverage put initial downward pressure on the sector.

As of Jun 17, 2025, Reuters and MarketWatch reported a Senate Finance Committee draft that proposed an accelerated phase-out of IRA solar tax credits through 2028. While some market participants judged the Senate draft less severe than the House language, the draft still materially reduced forward expectations for credit value and installation timing.

Why does this matter?

Reduced tax credits lower project returns: Many utility-scale and commercial projects are financed with models that assume IRA-level tax credits. Shrinking those incentives lowers IRR and may delay or cancel marginal projects.

Shortened construction windows compress demand timing: Developers rushed to secure tax equity and complete construction within earlier deadlines. A sudden policy change creates uncertainty about which pipeline projects will qualify.

Market pricing and capital allocation shift: Installers and developers with thin margins or heavy near-term project exposure (e.g., heavily levered residential installers or developers with backlogs concentrated near the eligibility cut-off) see equity valuations fall faster.

Market reaction to the drafts

On the headline days in mid‑June 2025, several large-cap solar-related stocks and solar ETFs dropped sharply. Reported moves included large intraday declines across both equipment makers and installers as investors re-assessed revenue visibility under a smaller incentive regime.

(See “Notable stock moves and ETFs” below for examples and percentages cited by contemporary coverage.)

Policy uncertainty and timeline risk for projects

Policy uncertainty is different from a definitive policy change. Even when a bill is not final, drafts or committee reports create timeline risk that affects financing and contract behavior.

Tax-equity and project finance require certainty: Lenders and tax-equity investors price in regulatory certainty. When the rules around eligibility, completion windows, or labor/content credits are uncertain, providers tighten terms or pause new commitments.

Developers face “hurry-up” or “wait” dilemmas: A shortened eligibility window creates an incentive to accelerate construction (raising costs) or to delay until rules are clarified (missing prior deadlines). Both outcomes are negative for predictability.

Pipeline reclassification: Some developers and public companies may reclassify or mark down backlog value if the probability that projects qualify for prior credit levels drops, producing negative revisions to revenue and earnings guidance.

This combination of timeline and eligibility uncertainty is one of the clearest explanations for why solar stocks are down today: future revenues that were previously considered baked into valuations are suddenly conditional.

Structural industry drivers

Beyond short-term headlines, structural factors have been pressuring margins and demand — amplifying equity sensitivity to policy news.

Financing costs and the interest-rate environment

Higher interest rates raise the cost of capital for long-dated projects. Key effects:

Utility-scale projects: Debt and tax-equity costs increase, lowering project IRRs and making some projects marginal or postponable.

Residential installations: Higher mortgage and consumer-lending rates reduce affordability for homeowners financing rooftop systems, slowing residential demand.

Discount-rate compression: A higher discount rate reduces the present value of long-term power-purchase agreements (PPA) cash flows.

When investors ask why solar stocks are down today, remember that interest-rate sensitivity makes near-term revenue and margin expectations more fragile. A sector already priced for aggressive incentive-driven growth is vulnerable to a higher‑rate regime.

Overcapacity, falling module prices and margins

Global polysilicon and module manufacturing capacity growth has reduced module prices and squeezed manufacturer gross margins. Effects include:

Inventory risk: Manufacturers and distributors holding unsold inventory face markdowns if demand softens.

Margin pressure: Lower module ASPs compress margins; for vertically integrated manufacturers the effect depends on cost structure and localized demand.

Price transmission: For developers and installers, falling module prices can be beneficial (lower procurement costs) but only if demand (installation growth) remains robust. When demand is expected to slow (because of policy or financing), lower prices do not offset the revenue impact for project developers and installers.

This supply-side dynamic increases the sector’s cyclicality and explains part of the sharp equity reactions when demand expectations are revised downward.

Regional supply-chain and trade measures

Trade restrictions, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, and localization incentives alter competitiveness across manufacturers. Examples of how trade dynamics matter:

Tariffs or import restrictions increase costs for buyers in markets reliant on foreign modules, increasing project economics uncertainty.

Onshoring incentives (investment or production credits) can help domestic manufacturers but often take time to implement and scale, creating interim uncertainty.

If policy-driven manufacturing shifts increase capital intensity or raise production costs, some manufacturers may see margins deteriorate in the near term even if the long-term demand outlook is positive.

These trade and supply-chain forces interact with tax-credit uncertainty and interest rates to produce outsized stock reactions.

Market segmentation: residential vs. utility vs. manufacturers/inverters

Solar is not a single business. Different segments react differently to the same headline:

Residential installers/financiers (e.g., public installers and consumer-focused companies): Highly sensitive to tax-credit changes, consumer finance costs, and local net‑metering rules. A roll-back or eligibility tightening often hits these names hardest.

Utility-scale developers: Sensitive to tax credit timelines, PPA markets, and access to tax equity. Developers with secured PPAs and completed financing have lower immediate exposure than early-stage pipeline.

Manufacturers and component suppliers (modules, inverters, trackers): Exposed to module price cycles, manufacturing cost curves, and trade policy; some may benefit from onshoring incentives while others suffer from lower ASPs.

This segmentation explains divergent stock performance: not all solar stocks move together, but many are correlated when the policy shock affects a large portion of the addressable market.

Market reaction and examples

When trying to understand why solar stocks are down today, examining the headline-day moves and which names were most affected helps illustrate the transmission mechanism from policy news to stock prices.

Notable stock moves and ETFs

As reported in mid-June 2025 coverage (Reuters, MarketWatch, Motley Fool), several high-profile solar-related equities and ETFs recorded steep declines on headline days. Representative examples from press coverage around Jun 17–21, 2025 include:

Enphase Energy: reported intraday declines in the mid-to-high‑20% range on a headline day (coverage cited ~27% moves on some sessions).

First Solar: dropped roughly 18% on June 17, 2025, per Motley Fool and other sources.

Sunrun: experienced very large intraday moves (greater than 40% on certain sessions reported in some outlets), reflecting its high policy exposure and leverage to residential incentives.

SolarEdge Technologies: recorded steep daily declines (coverage cited moves near ~39% on some headline sessions).

Solar-sector ETFs (e.g., mainstream solar ETFs tracked by market watchers and the MAC Solar Index): experienced broad outflows and NAV declines as constituents were repriced by headline risk.

Exact intraday percentages varied by source and session; the commonality was large magnitude moves concentrated on days with clear tax-credit or policy headlines.

Analyst responses and downgrades

After the headline drafts and committee reports, several sell‑side analysts and independent research shops issued updated notes. Common themes in analyst commentary included:

Revisions to project‑level economics: Analysts reduced near-term revenue and margin assumptions for developers and installers with large near-term pipelines.

Differentiation by business model: Some analysts emphasized that vertically integrated manufacturers with stable long-term contracts or lower-cost footprints could fare better than small-cap installers dependent on immediate tax credit timing.

Mixed severity views: Some analysts described the Senate draft as less damaging than the House language but still negative; others rebalanced coverage from growth assumptions to more conservative case scenarios.

These analyst notes reinforced the re-pricing and increased volatility as institutional holders adjusted models.

Regional variations and specific cases

The question why solar stocks are down today is often regionally nuanced: U.S. developments dominate headlines, but local policy and regulatory events in other markets (India, Europe, China) also produce targeted selloffs.

United States

The U.S. is the epicenter of the mid‑2025 selloff because IRA provisions had been a central driver of procurement and manufacturing investment. Key U.S. dynamics:

IRA rollback risk: Any credible phase-out or eligibility tightening reduces forward demand assumptions for both residential and large-scale projects.

Financing: The combination of policy uncertainty and higher rates tightened tax-equity markets and debt pricing.

State-level considerations: Net metering reforms and utility rate cases in key states (e.g., California) further complicate residential economics.

Companies with concentrated U.S. exposure and near-term project completion dependence were thus most affected.

India and other emerging markets

Regional regulatory rumors can cause sharp moves in local equities. For example:

As of Dec 8, 2025, Trade Brains reported that an MNRE (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy) rumor caused fall in some Indian solar names. Local clarifications or official guidance can reverse or deepen such moves quickly.

In emerging markets, domestic manufacturing incentives, local bank/ NBFC lending guidance, and import duties play a stronger role in near-term project economics than U.S. IRA-style credits.

Local regulatory uncertainty or sudden guidance changes therefore explain why some country-specific solar equities can drop even when U.S. headlines dominate global flows.

Europe and China-related dynamics

Europe’s demand and China-linked supply dynamics also matter:

Europe: Incentive programs, permitting timelines, and grid-connection bottlenecks influence deployment schedules. European installers and developers feel the effect when incentive expectations change.

China: As the world’s largest module producer, Chinese module pricing and export policy shifts affect global ASPs, inventory levels, and manufacturer margins. Sanctions or trade frictions (where applicable) alter competitive positioning and can amplify market moves.

Global investors often react to a combination of U.S. policy risk and China/Europe supply signals, magnifying sector volatility.

Short‑term outlook and potential catalysts for stabilization or further declines

When trying to answer why solar stocks are down today, investors should track a set of near-term catalysts that could reverse or deepen the slump.

Positive catalysts (could stabilize or lift stocks)

Clarifying legislation or amendments that preserve significant IRA-like credits, or that provide transition relief for projects near completion.

Central-bank dovishness or actual rate cuts that reduce financing costs for projects and consumer loans for residential systems.

Strong corporate or utility procurement announcements and PPA wins that validate demand for utility-scale projects despite policy noise.

Module price stabilization that reduces inventory markdown risk and supports manufacturer margins.

Local policy actions that strengthen domestic manufacturing incentives or provide tax-equity-like mechanisms.

Negative catalysts (could deepen declines)

Passage of legislation that materially phases out or tightens credits earlier than market expectations.

Further rate hikes that increase financing costs and further compress project economics.

Large cancellations of projects or visible tax-equity pullbacks leading to write-downs by developers.

Widespread inventory clearance at sharply reduced prices that signals prolonged demand weakness.

Monitoring these items helps explain any further episodes of volatility and why solar stocks could suffer additional downside.

Investor considerations and risk factors

This section focuses on neutral, factual considerations to understand exposure — not investment advice.

Differentiate by business model: Manufacturers, trackers, inverters, installers, and utility developers each face distinct risk sets (policy exposure, margin cycles, balance-sheet leverage).

Balance-sheet and liquidity: Firms with strong liquidity and low near-term refinancing needs are relatively better positioned to weather policy uncertainty.

Backlog quality: The proportion of revenues tied to fully permitted and financed projects versus early-stage pipeline matters for resilience.

Contract structure: Fixed-price EPC contracts, long-term PPAs, and manufacturing supply agreements change exposure to module-price moves and credit changes.

Macro sensitivity: High leverage, reliance on tax equity, or heavy consumer-financing exposure increases sensitivity to rate moves and policy risk.

For traders and investors attempting to answer why solar stocks are down today, these company-level fundamentals explain why certain names were hit harder than others on headline days.

Valuation and time horizons

Policy changes primarily alter near-term cash flows; many long-term investors view large-scale decarbonization as a multi-decade secular trend. The immediate re-pricing reflects near-term risk, while long-term demand assumptions depend on technology cost curves, electrification policy, and global decarbonization commitments.

Consequently, whether a recent pullback is a buying opportunity or a warning sign depends on horizon, exposure to near-term incentives, and company-specific execution and balance-sheet strength.

Historical context

Tax incentives, tariffs, and financing cycles have repeatedly driven solar industry boom-bust dynamics. Two historical points help contextualize current moves:

Past incentive shocks: When tax credits or feed-in tariffs were reduced in prior cycles, installations and public valuations corrected sharply — often followed by consolidation and eventual recovery as cost declines continued.

Technology and cost progress: Over the last decade, module-cost declines and efficiency gains have supported long-term demand even as cyclical corrections occur. The IRA (enacted earlier in the decade) had been a major growth accelerator; credible rollbacks therefore create outsized market reactions precisely because they remove an important growth driver.

Understanding that policy and rate cycles have historically produced large, often temporary, valuation moves explains why short-term selloffs can be severe even when long-term demand remains plausible.

Will Lucid stock ever go up is a common question from investors who followed Lucid Group's dramatic price swings since its public listing. This article focuses on Lucid Group (ticker: LCID on the Nasdaq) and synthesizes historical performance, the main drivers that move the stock, analyst views, recent catalysts, upside and downside scenarios, short‑term trading considerations, and a practical checklist for readers who want to judge progress. The intent is to present documented facts and commonly cited market considerations rather than to give investment advice.

Introduction

Many investors ask “will lucid stock ever go up” because Lucid surged to very high valuations after its SPAC listing and subsequently experienced a large drawdown amid production, margin and financing concerns. Public coverage shows mixed analyst views and repeated volatility tied to deliveries, guidance and partnership news. This article aggregates publicly reported information and common valuation drivers to help readers form an evidence‑based view.

Company overview

Lucid Group (originally Lucid Motors) is an electric vehicle company focused on luxury electric sedans and future SUVs. The company’s first production vehicle is the Lucid Air, a premium electric sedan notable for its range and technology; Lucid has also announced an upcoming Gravity SUV and has signaled plans for lower‑priced models over time. Lucid went public via a SPAC merger and trades under the ticker LCID on the Nasdaq. A sizable strategic investment from Saudi stakeholders and notable management hires have been part of its public story.

Historical stock performance

When people ask “will lucid stock ever go up,” they are often recalling the stock’s post‑SPAC trajectory: initial enthusiasm and very high valuations followed by a multiyear decline. After public listing, LCID’s market valuation soared into the tens of billions on growth expectations and EV hype; subsequent execution challenges, slower production ramps, and repeated capital raises contributed to a decline often cited as a fall of more than 80–90% from peak levels. Since then, LCID has experienced episodes of high volatility tied to quarterly delivery reports, guidance changes, strategic announcements, and macro risk events.

Primary drivers of Lucid’s stock price

Operational fundamentals

Operational metrics are core to whether investors answer “will lucid stock ever go up” positively. Key operational fundamentals include production volume, vehicle deliveries, manufacturing scale, and gross margins. Investors track:

Quarterly vehicle deliveries versus guidance and consensus expectations.

Factory utilization and ramp speed at Lucid’s Arizona manufacturing facility and any new plants.

Gross margin per vehicle and whether unit economics trend toward profitability.

Consistent, scalable production growth with improving gross margins is a primary pathway for LCID to regain investor confidence.

Financial position and capital markets

The company’s cash burn, debt profile, equity financing activity and remaining cash runway strongly affect market sentiment. When investors ask “will lucid stock ever go up,” they implicitly weigh the risk that continued losses will force dilutive financings. Frequent capital raises or high cash burn without a visible path to improving margins can keep downward pressure on the stock.

Product and technology factors

Product specifications and battery/pack technology are important. Lucid’s vehicle energy efficiency, range, charging speed, and battery cost influence both consumer demand and unit economics. The launch timing and pricing of the Gravity SUV and any planned lower‑priced models are material — successful execution could broaden addressable demand and improve scale; delays or disappointing specs/pricing can reverse sentiment.

Strategic partnerships and corporate developments

Large commercial partnerships, fleet deals and strategic investments move expectations about future revenue and distribution. Announcements tying Lucid to ride‑hailing fleets, delivery fleets or robotaxi pilots may create growth narratives. When such deals are reported, the market often re‑prices LCID based on the perceived size and profitability of those opportunities.

Market, policy and macro factors

Industry‑level factors influence whether people conclude “will lucid stock ever go up.” EV adoption trends, consumer incentives (such as EV tax credits), supply chain dynamics, commodity costs (notably battery materials), and interest rates all affect valuation. A supportive policy environment or improved macro liquidity can make capital‑intensive growth stories more attractive.

Competitive and execution risks

Competition from Tesla and legacy automakers, and execution risk in scaling manufacturing, are continual headwinds. Management turnover, missed timelines, or quality issues can exacerbate negative sentiment and increase the chance of further downward price moves.

Analyst views and published valuations

Analyst coverage of LCID shows a wide dispersion of opinion and price targets. Some outlets present bearish or neutral takes emphasizing capital needs and execution risk, while other analysts construct bullish scenarios based on optimistic volume ramps and margin improvements.

As of 2025-07-28, one prominent outlet published a cautious take emphasizing near‑term cash flow risk and potential for further dilution.

As of 2025-10-28, some market commentators presented multi‑year bullish scenarios that hinge on margins, Gravity execution, and meaningful fleet deals.

The divergence in published valuations typically stems from differing assumptions about long‑term growth rates, achievable gross margins, the cost and timing of capital raises, and the size/timing of fleet or partnership revenue. Because these inputs vary widely among analysts, price targets for LCID have historically spanned a large range.

Recent catalysts and news items that have moved the stock

Events that have historically triggered significant LCID price moves include:

Quarterly production and delivery reports that beat or miss guidance.

Guidance revisions for volumes, margins or capex.

Announcements of material partnerships (for example, fleet or autonomous vehicle pilots) and strategic investments.

Significant capital raises, insider or large institutional trades, or major changes to the board/executive team.

As of 2025-10-28, some published coverage highlighted how delivery beats or partnership news produced temporary rallies, while repeated capital raises tended to pressure the share price.

Upside scenarios (what would likely need to happen for the stock to meaningfully rise)

Bull case (execution + scale)

Lucid sustains a consistent production ramp and demonstrates increasing deliveries quarter after quarter.

Gross margins improve materially toward industry norms for profitable EV makers, driven by scale, cost reductions and optimized battery packs.

The Gravity SUV launches on time with strong demand, and any more affordable models expand the addressable market.

Meaningful, revenue‑generating partnerships or fleet contracts are converted from announcements to booked, recurring sales.

Lucid shows a clear path to reduced cash burn or positive free cash flow on a run‑rate basis.

Timing considerations

Such improvements typically play out over multiple quarters to several years; however, share price can react sooner to notable news items such as proof of volume milestones, margin inflection or definitive large commercial contracts.

Downside scenarios and persistent risks

Bear case

The company repeatedly misses production targets and fails to improve gross margins.

High cash losses force frequent dilutive financings, eroding shareholder value.

Demand weakens due to macro pressures or loss of incentives, or competition captures key segments.

Strategic partnerships fail to materialize into significant revenue.

Any of these outcomes could keep the share price depressed or drive it lower.

Technical/market trading considerations (short‑term factors)

Beyond fundamentals, LCID has demonstrated high volatility and can be influenced by:

Liquidity and daily trading volume.

Short interest and short‑covering dynamics.

Momentum flows, option‑related hedging, and headline‑driven retail interest.

These technical forces make short‑term price moves difficult to predict and can amplify both up and down swings.

How to evaluate whether Lucid stock ""will go up"" for you

If your objective is to evaluate whether “will lucid stock ever go up” applies to your portfolio, track a focused checklist of observable metrics and milestones:

Quarterly deliveries versus company guidance and consensus estimates.

Gross margin per vehicle and trends over successive quarters.

Cash runway and announced financing plans — whether dilution is likely in upcoming quarters.

Progress on Gravity launch timing, pricing, and reservation conversion (if reservation data is disclosed).

Evidence that fleet partnerships are generating orders or firm contracts rather than just letters of intent.

Management commentary and execution consistency, including manufacturing yields and quality metrics.

Analyst revisions and changes in institutional ownership.

Align any view with your personal risk tolerance and investment horizon. Growth, execution and financing risks mean realization of a positive scenario could take years and may involve substantial drawdowns along the way.

Reasoned outlook and balanced perspective

Under a credible path of execution, margin improvement and successful commercialization of partnerships, LCID’s stock could appreciate materially over time. However, substantial execution, financing and competitive risks make outcomes highly uncertain, and published price targets vary widely because they rest on divergent assumptions about production scale, margins and capital needs.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Q: What are the fastest indicators of a turnaround?

A: Quick indicators include consecutive quarterly delivery beats, a sustained improvement in gross margin per vehicle, and signs that cash burn has meaningfully reduced or that the company has secured non‑dilutive financing or revenue‑bearing partnership contracts.

Q: How important are Uber/Nuro‑style deals?

A: Strategic partnerships can be important for growth narratives and distribution, but their value depends on whether deals are binding, generate near‑term revenue, and contribute to profitable unit economics. Announcements alone are less valuable than contracts and order flow that convert into recognizable revenue.

Q: How quickly could dilution happen?

A: Dilution pace depends on cash burn and access to capital markets. If operating losses continue at a high rate and the company lacks profitable free‑cash‑flow prospects, management may need to issue equity or raise debt within quarters rather than years. Watch reported cash runway and recent financing statements for timing clues.

Now onto today's story.

The Story

Over the last few weeks, silver prices have returned to the spotlight. There’s news about a supply crunch as industrial demand is climbing upward for the metal that usually lives in the shadow of gold.

At first glance, that seems odd. Silver isn’t oil. It isn’t coal. It isn’t even copper. But its resurgence says something important about how the world is trying to fix its energy problem.

Because every major energy transition in history has followed the same pattern. It solves the problem we are worried about at the moment, but creates a new set of problems that only become visible later.

Coal replaced wood and saved forests, but filled cities with smoke. Oil replaced coal and made transport affordable, but it made the world more dependent on fossil fuels. Natural gas cleaned up the air around cities, but didn’t really solve the climate problem. Each transition felt like progress, and each came with trade-offs that only became obvious at scale.

Solar energy sits in the same lineage, promising cleaner air, lower emissions, and energy independence. And in many ways, it delivers. But like every transition before it, there is a hidden downside that only becomes apparent at scale.

For years, solar energy has been sold as the cleanest solution to our climate problem. No smoke, no fuel, no moving parts. Just sunlight turning into electricity.

And to be fair, that story isn’t wrong. Once installed, a solar panel generates power with almost zero emissions. Costs have fallen sharply over the past decade, and installations are scaling rapidly. Governments, too, around the world are embracing solar because it seems to hit two birds with one stone. It helps meet climate targets and reduces dependence on imported fuels.

This is why solar is often framed as a silver bullet. The underlying narrative is simple and comforting. Replace coal plants with solar panels, add some batteries, and the energy problem largely takes care of itself.

These systems, though, don’t operate on narratives, but on physics, materials, and reliability. And that’s where the solar story starts to become more complicated.

Solar energy’s biggest limitation is also its most obvious one. The sun doesn’t follow demand.

Solar power generation peaks around midday, when the sun is at its brightest. But electricity demand usually peaks after sunset, when people return home, switch on lights, cook dinner, and run appliances. That mismatch creates a fundamental problem for power grids. The electricity is generated when it’s least needed and disappears when demand is at its highest.

To deal with this, grids need either extensive transmission infrastructure to move power from solar-surplus regions to solar-deficient ones or they need storage and backup generation. Either of these is expensive, stores power only for short durations, and degrades over time.

As a result, even countries with heavy solar adoption continue to rely on fossil fuels, hydroelectric power, or nuclear energy to maintain stability once the sun goes down or when weather conditions turn unfavourable.

So if we truly need a renewable energy source, it is something that must be predictable, scalable, and have low carbon emissions. Nuclear is arguably the only thing that ticks all three. But that’s a topic for another day.

Then, there’s another issue with solar that receives far less attention and yet looms just as large. And that is manufacturing the panels itself.

Solar power does not burn fuel, but it consumes an enormous amount of physical resources. Silicon is needed for the cells.

Aluminium for frames and mounting structures. Copper for wiring and inverters. Silver for electrical contacts. Glass made from high-purity sand to protect the cells. When you add all this up, solar ends up being far more material-intensive per unit of electricity capacity than coal or natural gas. Here’s an infographic to help you understand:

And mining those materials is neither clean nor low-carbon. From extraction to processing, the entire supply chain is highly energy-intensive. On top of that, components are transported across continents before a panel ever reaches a rooftop or a solar farm. Most of this activity still runs on fossil fuels. As a result, a significant portion of a solar panel’s lifetime emissions are front-loaded during mining and manufacturing. That said, we do agree that panels repay this carbon debt over time, but that repayment is gradual rather than instant.

Apart from this, as solar installations scale globally, demand for both silver and copper is increasing. Photovoltaic cells (the individual solar cell in a solar panel) manufacturing alone accounted for about 14% of global silver consumption in 2023, driven by its use in photovoltaic cells.

Copper demand is even more widespread, as we need it not just for solar panels but also for inverters, transmission lines, electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and the necessary grid upgrades to support a renewable-heavy system.

Naturally, when demand grows faster than supply, prices increase. So part of the recent strength in silver and copper prices isn’t just driven by speculation or short-term cycles; it could also be because of this increased demand.

There is also a geographic imbalance embedded in this transition. The environmental damage caused by mining is local and immediate. Communities near mines deal with land degradation, water pollution, and waste. Meanwhile, the benefits of clean electricity are enjoyed far away, often in cities and industries thousands of kilometres from the point of extraction.

Once you add this to the cost of upgrading grids, recycling challenges for aging panels, and policy uncertainty into the equation, solar starts to look less black-and-white and more complex.

However, none of this makes solar a bad idea. Countries aren’t wrong to invest heavily in it. Solar is cheap, scalable, and far cleaner than the fossil fuels it replaces. It will almost certainly remain one of the pillars of the energy transition.

But it is clean only at the point of generation, not at the point of extraction. It reduces emissions gradually over time. And while it lowers fossil fuel consumption, it does not replace reliable, always-on power capacity one-for-one at an industrial level. Instead, it sits atop grids that still need storage, backup, and careful balancing to function smoothly.

The real risk isn’t overinvestment in solar. It’s underestimating everything else the transition demands. It’s that they might convince themselves that solar alone can do the heavy lifting, without fully grappling with the trade-offs, such as a poor electricity grid and subpar storage capacity, that come with it.

That said, apart from just investing in solar farms, countries should also allocate a portion of their budgets to these additional, but necessary, upgrades. Unless that gap is acknowledged, solar will remain both a solution and a source of new constraints.

Until then…

But we can let you in on the big storylines our reporters and editors are keeping a close eye on as we head into 2026. Here’s the list, covering everything from companies on the cusp of tech breakthroughs to policy debates that are hitting a boiling point.

The decoupling of vibes from progress

Things are getting messy. President Donald Trump has gutted the only significant decarbonization law the U.S. ever managed to pass. Blue-state governors are backsliding on clean energy goals and easing up on fossil fuels under the cover of affordability. Oil and gas companies have dropped the pretense of caring about climate. ESG is dead. The ​“climate hawk” is dead. The words ​“pragmatism” and ​“realism” have become as inescapable in climate policy discourse as reminders of planetary warming are in the weather reports.

Yes, the climate conversation has changed dramatically over the last year, at least in the Western world. But the techno-economic trends that are driving decarbonization forward have not. Clean energy — mostly solar — is still being built at a blistering pace. EVs are beginning to run gas cars off the road. China’s emissions could be starting to decline. The world is on track for far less warming than it was when the Paris Agreement was signed a decade ago, and we’re still in the early innings of clean energy deployment.

In 2026, I’ll be watching this dissonance between decarbonization vibes and reality. Will politicians, companies, and others grow increasingly quiet on climate, all while the clean energy revolution speaks louder and louder? — Dan McCarthy, senior editor

The rise of virtual power plants

What do you do when you can’t build actual power plants fast enough to keep the lights on and the air conditioners humming? You turn to virtual power plants.

Utilities and regulators have in recent years begun to embrace these networks of rooftop solar panels, backup batteries, plugged-in electric vehicles, smart thermostats, remote-controllable water heaters, and other ​“distributed energy resources” in homes and businesses. By controlling this equipment to lower electricity demand and provide energy to the grid, utilities can replicate much of the value of a traditional, centralized power plant.

Now, the AI boom is forcing decision-makers to take VPPs even more seriously. Gigawatts of planned data centers are pushing up already high and rising utility bills. Equipment shortages are making it nearly impossible to quickly build gas plants, while interconnection bottlenecks are preventing lots of utility-scale renewables from coming online. And the risks of overbuilding to serve what could end up being an AI bubble are rising.

VPPs could help solve all those problems by enlisting energy tech that people are already buying. What I’m eyeing in 2026 is whether utilities, grid operators, and the state and federal regulators overseeing them put their weight behind the VPP build-out. — Jeff St. John, chief reporter and policy specialist

The make-or-break moment for the American nuclear renaissance

2026 is a threshold year for the American nuclear industry as it strives to lay the foundation for an unprecedented scale-up of atomic energy in the U.S. — quadrupling nuclear generating capacity by 2050, as per President Trump’s executive order.

The operators of the Palisades and Three Mile Island plants are pledging 2026 and 2027 restart dates for those mothballed reactors. Additional Trump executive orders are aiming for three advanced nuclear startups to achieve criticality in 2026. (One reactor has already staked that claim.)

Over the coming months, I’ll be tracking whether the industry keeps its bold promise of power-plant restarts and advanced reactor development. We’ll be reporting on the crop of nuclear startups and whether they can deliver on their audacious claims. And we’ll be watching whether the U.S. can start building nuclear reactors at scale.

If those plans are backed by sufficient capital and follow-through, they could restore some of the country’s lost atomic luster. If not, the U.S will have ceded its global nuclear leadership to China and Russia. — Eric Wesoff, executive director

The wind-energy win brewing in New England’s far north

Northernmost Maine has strong winds and lots of open space. But renewable energy developers have not yet managed to capitalize on these conditions to build substantial onshore wind farms, even though the idea has been floating around the state since at least 2008. Last year, Maine energy officials and regional grid operator ISO New England kick-started yet another effort to get turbines spinning up north with requests for proposals for both generation and transmission lines to carry the power south to the rest of the region.

I’ll be watching closely for a few reasons: First, the New England grid needs more power supply as the climate-conscious states it serves make moves to electrify buildings and transportation, and 1,200 megawatts of onshore wind would certainly help. Also, if the plan succeeds, it could offer valuable lessons about the economics of developing renewable energy in the face of federal hostility, which, I think we can all agree, is unlikely to abate anytime soon. — Sarah Shemkus, Northeast reporter

The financial case for electric buildings

As voters worry about the cost-of-living crisis, all-electric new buildings could help keep mortgage payments and energy bills down.

Though exact savings depend on local energy costs, a growing number of analyses have found that all-electric new construction makes financial sense. Building a home with only an electric system is often a simpler feat than building it with both electricity and gas. In some cases, all-electric homes can save people thousands of dollars over the lifetime of super-efficient electric appliances, such as heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters. Even retrofitting an existing structure with these technologies can pay off in the long term, especially in areas with favorable electricity rates.

Yet policymakers who once pushed ambitious electrification standards have been pulling back. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) waived her city’s requirement that new buildings be all-electric after last year’s catastrophic wildfires, then repealed it completely. In June, air-quality regulators in Southern California punted a plan that would have incentivized a gradual phasedown of gas furnaces and water heaters sold in the region. And New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) delayed her state’s first-in-the-nation all-electric building code, which would have taken effect on Dec. 31, 2025.

In 2026, I want to see if politicians and regulators will recognize that electrification can in fact boost affordability, especially in newly built homes. — Alison F. Takemura, staff writer

The geothermal breakthrough on the horizon

Geothermal energy startups have raised huge sums of money in recent months and years to develop next-generation technologies for harnessing Earth’s heat. But so far, the companies have delivered relatively little carbon-free electricity to the grid.

That will change this year, when Fervo Energy flips the switch on its Cape Station facility in Utah. The startup is building an ​“enhanced geothermal system” that uses fracking techniques to create geothermal reservoirs in hard, impermeable rocks. The first 100 megawatts (of an eventual 500 MW) are slated to go online in October, which would make Cape Station the biggest project of its kind to connect to the grid worldwide.

The development will send ​“a powerful signal that next-generation geothermal is moving from promise to commercial reality,” said Jeremy O’Brien of geoscience software company Seequent. ​“We expect this milestone to accelerate both investor interest and government support globally.”

Fervo isn’t alone in its ambitions. The company Eavor will start working this spring to expand its first-of-a-kind geothermal project in Germany, and firms like Sage Geosystems, Quaise, XGS, and Zanskar are accelerating efforts to satisfy demand for clean, around-the-clock power. I’ll be watching closely to see whether 2026 proves to be the pivotal year the industry is hoping for. — Maria Gallucci, senior reporter

The tug-of-war over clean energy in Ohio

Ohio, where I report from, has for years been a hotbed for dark money and a testing ground for national efforts to hinder action on climate change. State lawmakers and regulators continue to throw up obstacles to renewable energy development, while giving preference to new fossil-fueled power plants. One pending bill, for example, calls for energy permitting decisions to make sure facilities ​“employ affordable, reliable, and clean energy sources,” with ​“reliable” meaning energy that’s available at all times and ​“clean” defined to include natural gas. I’ll keep investigating those efforts in 2026 to hold the people in power accountable as the public struggles with rising energy costs and worsening climate change impacts.

But it’s not all bad news in the Buckeye State, as some communities rally in support of clean energy. One story I’m particularly excited to cover is a May referendum that will give voters the chance to overturn a local solar and wind ban covering most of their county — an approach that could take off elsewhere in Ohio and in other states that allow local restrictions on renewable power. — Kathiann M. Kowalski, contributing reporter based in Ohio

The AI boom’s battery awakening

2026 will be the year we start seeing batteries bridge the gap between data centers’ sky-high power demand and what the U.S. grid can actually deliver.

A well-placed battery system can secure electricity for AI computing hubs in the relatively few hours each year when the grid can’t supply them. That can allow data centers to get built far sooner than if they waited for pricey and time-consuming power network upgrades.

Storage developers are reporting a frenzy of interest in such projects, but these typically are shrouded in secrecy. I recently reported on the first publicly confirmed project of this kind, which entered construction in Oregon for Aligned Data Centers and should start operating in 2026. Utility Portland General Electric will own that one and use it to guarantee power a few years earlier than it could have with conventional grid upgrades.

What I found most intriguing is that the data center developer is paying for this smart grid upgrade. This arrangement lays out a rare positive vision for the nation’s energy future: The companies that stand to make boatloads of money on data centers could fund grid upgrades that benefit everyone, as opposed to the general public subsidizing those upgrades to pad the profits of AI ventures. In the year ahead, I’ll be tracking the proliferation of batteries for data centers, and what they mean for consumers’ energy bills. — Julian Spector, senior reporter

The fate of coal in the Midwest

Over the past decade, scores of Midwestern coal plants have closed, as environmental regulations kicked in and coal-fired generation became more expensive than natural gas or renewables.

Utilities are pushing back retirement dates for coal plants as electricity-demand forecasts increase exponentially due to proposed data centers — many of which may never get built. The Trump administration is ordering plants on the brink of closure to stay open and easing up on rules around pollution from coal power. Indiana’s Republican Gov. Mike Braun issued an executive order last spring calling for coal plant ​“life extensions,” and Illinois experts are researching controversial ​“clean coal technologies,” including at a demonstration carbon-capture plant that went online in 2024.

Coal is embedded in the culture in these states, and it’s highly political, as I’ve heard many times from elected officials, grassroots activists, and coal miners. In 2026, I’ll be closely tracking how this campaign to revive coal progresses and what it means on the ground in Midwest communities where it is burned and mined. After all, coal isn’t just an increasingly expensive way to generate electricity; it’s also incredibly polluting. — Kari Lydersen, contributing reporter based in Illinois

Thanks to President Trump’s ire, it’s likely that no new offshore wind farms will be completed in the U.S. until 2035, save for the five projects already being built, BloombergNEF predicted in early December. Even those projects aren’t guaranteed, a fact underscored by the 90-day pause on wind farm construction issued Dec. 22 by the Interior Department.

But Northeast U.S. states aren’t giving up on the renewable energy source. Massachusetts is exploring sourcing offshore wind power from Canada, with Democratic Gov. Maura Healey meeting with Nova Scotia’s premier last month to discuss partnering on energy needs. Maine also seems interested.

In 2026, I’ll be keeping a close eye on whether these deals materialize — and what they mean for North America’s offshore wind workforce and supply chain, which grew under the Biden administration and could otherwise wither away under Trump 2.0. — Clare Fieseler, reporter",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2219197895.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=afe3e6d3747ad8fc1f050000c8b29a2e,N,,2026-01-05 04:12:30.748043

OG&E believes the law requires the use of CWIP, while consumer advocates disagree, calling the law unconstitutional.","Consumer advocacy groups are lining up against an OG&E rate increase request, marking what could become a major test of a new law that changes the way utilities can pay for new construction.

In a fiery statement released in December, the Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers (OIEC) and AARP Oklahoma called for Oklahoma Corporation Commissioners to reject a rate hike request for two new power plants planned for completion east of Oklahoma City in 2029.

“If there is a Scrooge this holiday season it is OG&E,” said AARP Oklahoma State Director Sean Voskuhl.

“On the heels of OG&E’s $500 million pre-approval case, where the Oklahoma Corporation Commission rejected OG&E’s attempt to recover an additional $100 million in financing costs, they turned right around and are asking for it again,” Voskuhl said. “OG&E simply cannot take ‘No’ for an answer, but they should.”

The opposing sides are arguing over new regulatory parameters created by Oklahoma Senate Bill 998, which passed during the last legislative session. The law allows utilities to ask for rate increases to help pay for Construction Work In Progress, otherwise known as CWIP.

OG&E believes the law requires the use of CWIP, while consumer advocates disagree, calling the law unconstitutional.

Under CWIP, commissioners can approve rate increases to pay for projects as they are being built. Prior to the law, utilities were required to wait until facilities were completed and operational before they could ask to raise rates.

OG&E says a rate increase through the new law would allow it to raise construction funding while the project is underway, which would help reduce the amount of interest accrued on $506 million in construction loan debt. The company estimates it could save as much as $173 million in interest costs, which is an expense that would be passed on to ratepayers.

The new law provides an avenue for saving ratepayers money, said Christi Woodworth, OG&E vice president of marketing and communications.

“Historically, we’d go borrow the money to build facilities. Then, when they’re operational and turned on, we’d start putting it into rates,” she said. “Meanwhile, we’re making interest payments all along the way, but customers aren’t helping provide the dollars for that until the project is fully operational, which means all of that interest accumulates.”

Adam Singer, attorney for AARP Oklahoma said that’s not the case. “Basically, they’re asking some, or many of their customers to pay for facilities that they may never see the benefit of.”

“You may have people that move away, start paying today and move away after two years, so now they’ve paid for a facility they don’t get the benefit of. Or, you have an elderly person who passes away, and even though they’re near the end of their life, their rates have gone up.

“There’s a reason in my eyes that the company is pushing so hard for these changes, and I think it’s just dollars,” Singer said. “I think Senate Bill 998 is unconstitutional.”

OIEC Executive Director Thomas Schroedter says the new law and OG&E’s rate request will end up costing ratepayers more than the traditional way of financing construction, and he believes the legislature made a mistake in passing the measure.

“It’s not in the best interest of ratepayers if you take the time value of money into account,” said Schroedter, whose organization represents about 30 member companies that consume large amounts of electricity. “The law interferes with the Corporation Commission’s authority to ensure just and reasonable rates for utility customers.”

Every one of OG&E’s stakeholders and PSO stakeholders oppose the law, Shroedter said, “and so in this upcoming session, the legislature needs to repeal this ill-conceived law.”

The law will subsidize a budding data center industry, which is rapidly expanding with new development across the state, he said.

“What’s happening here is OG&E customers are being forced to finance these power plants for these new large-load customers, and it’s not right,” Schroedter said. “If it’s upheld, the new law will require customers to finance capital investments needed to serve large-load artificial intelligence customers that will be coming on to OG&E’s system in the future.

“The data centers won’t be built for eight years from now and they won’t be paying any of the financing costs of these plants, so current ratepayers will be subsidizing these plants,” he said. “That’s unfair.”

The new rate case will mark the second time OG&E has asked for advanced funding for its planned plants at Horseshoe Lake. The Corporation Commission turned the utility’s request down in early December.

Schroedter says commissioners denied the company’s request once and OG&E shouldn’t be allowed to have another bite at the apple.

But the power company contends that its first request was turned down for legal reasons. Its initial request was submitted to the commission in May, which was three months before the new law went into effect.

Now that the law is in effect, OG&E says the Oklahoma Legislature now requires the use of CWIP because it significantly reduces overall interest costs incurred during construction.",https://journalrecord.com/files/2026/01/Utility-rates-web-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 05:13:28.400365

Commercial and Industrial Carbon Challenge Awards

The Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Carbon Challenge is a competitive program that provides funding to large energy users such as manufacturers, colleges, universities, health care facilities, and office building owners in New York State to implement clean energy projects that reduce carbon emissions. Projects may utilize a combination of energy or manufacturing process efficiency strategies, carbon capture technology, low-carbon fuel utilization, renewable generation, or energy storage.

NYSERDA awarded over $5 million for two projects located in the Finger Lakes and Capital Region:

Finger Lakes Health will implement seven greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects over the next three years at Geneva General Hospital in Geneva and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hospital in Penn Yan, replacing aging systems, improving HVAC system resilience, and reducing energy use.

The Saratoga County Sewer District will modify existing processes at the County's existing wastewater treatment plant to provide a long-term, cost-saving solution for biosolids management that produces renewable fuels and reduces the environmental impact of operations.

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, ""Under Governor Hochul's leadership, New York's regional approach to economic development continues to create jobs and leverage private investments. With more than hundreds of projects supported across the state through multiple programs and state agencies, we are promoting opportunities that will generate sustainable economic growth.""

New York Secretary of State Walter T. Mosley said, ""Sustainable building practices are key elements in the state's economic, energy and environmental future. Our partnership with NYSERDA on our Downtown Revitalization Initiative and the State Energy Plan is creating green buildings and projects throughout the State, and our mutual commitment to communities identified as disadvantaged further ensures that our transition to a green economy is both just and equitable. We look forward to expanding that partnership into the future as we implement the Governor's visionary and practical energy goals.""

Today's announcement builds on the success of these two programs. Through the Building Cleaner Communities Competition, 70 projects have leveraged nearly $1.3 billion in public and private investment since 2018 to implement carbon neutral or net zero energy performance solutions. Through the C&I Carbon Challenge since 2018, NYSERDA has made awards that will cumulatively reduce 7.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of removing more than 1 million cars from the road annually.

Funding for this program was included in the 2025 Regional Economic Development Council Initiative. The REDC process continues to support and empower regional stakeholders in developing strategic plans and funding priorities that meet local economic needs. Regional Councils reviewed projects from this program and provided scores that reflect how well a project aligns with a region's goals and strategies. Applicants utilized New York's Consolidated Funding Application, the state's single application for state resources, which includes programs for numerous agencies.

Blue states gouge residents and businesses with exorbitant rates. But even worse are the bald-faced lies blue-state politicians tell you to defend the gouging.

Instead of admitting that expensive electricity is a choice they’re deliberately making — your budget be damned — they lie, claiming wind and solar power are “affordable” and “reliable.”

The shameless gaslighting was on full display last month, in response to a Trump administration edict pausing offshore wind farm construction along the East Coast near Virginia, New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

The administration claims that the huge installations obscure the detection of potential foreign adversaries that could threaten “east coast population centers.” President Donald Trump paused construction until a solution, if any, could be devised.

The minute the administration issued the pause, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont accused the Trump administration of “making things up.” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it “B.S. ”

Maybe. Admittedly, the Trump announcement was short on facts to back up its security pretext. But the possible deception on Trump’s side is mild compared with the lies spewed by Democrats in response. Hochul claimed wind power will “keep energy costs down” and “strengthen reliability.” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong’s office spuriously insisted wind power will save ratepayers “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Lamont claimed a “diverse energy supply” that includes wind will “lower utility costs for families.”

Nonsense. In fact, worse than nonsense. Deliberate lying. Each state has the authority to decide the mix of energy sources that go into its electric grid. Blue states have mandated ever-increasing reliance on wind, as well as solar, instead of fossil fuels, explains the Institute for Energy Research.

New Yorkers pay, on average, 58% more for their electricity than the national average because of the green mandates state politicians have imposed and the power sources they exclude, such as natural gas fracking.

Connecticut ratepayers are fleeced even more, paying nearly double the national average rate for electricity.

Climate-driven pols, almost all of them Democrats, should at least admit they’re making decisions based on ideology and, in many cases, pressure from the renewable energy lobby. Instead, they parrot falsehoods about “affordability” and “reliability.”

Offshore wind power is at least twice as expensive per kilowatt as natural gas-generated electricity or almost any other source.

Citing 70 countries around the world, Bjorn Lomborg concludes that “global evidence is clear: Adding more solar and wind to the energy supply pushes up the price of electricity.”

How about “reliability,” the other word blue-state pols repeat ad nauseam to defend renewable energy sources?

Germany learned how unreliable renewables are. Germany installed massive solar and wind equipment to meet 70% of its grid’s needs. But on cloudy or nearly windless days, these renewables deliver a mere 4% — hardly “reliable.” Germany has had to maintain two generating systems at a massive cost. Germans pay 43 cents per kilowatt hour, more than twice what Canadians with similar climate conditions but a reliance on fossil fuels pay.

UK liberal politicians went all out for green energy, but many are now backtracking. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak paused the UK’s transition to net-zero carbon use. Scotland’s government abandoned its goal of a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030.

New England (and the rest of the U.S.) could learn something from old England. Renewables are budget-busters, burdening consumers and slowing economic growth. California’s increasing reliance on renewables — now up to 39% of the grid’s mix — explains why their residents and businesses pay the second-highest rates in the nation, behind Hawaii. That high cost is hobbling growth and causing “energy poverty” among low-income residents who can’t pay their electric bills.

Electric bills were a hot-button issue in the recent New Jersey gubernatorial election. Bills had increased by double digits in the year leading up to the election, partly because outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy retired fossil fuel sources just when power demand was soaring.

Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill promised that investing in offshore wind would “lower energy costs for families,” a blatantly false statement. Republican Jack Ciattarelli pledged to ban offshore wind farms and pursue a more diverse, affordable energy mix. Sherrill’s fib won out.

In blue states everywhere, Americans struggling to pay for electricity need to elect political leaders who will make affordability a priority. But to do that, voters need to hear the truth. So far, they’re getting a pack of lies about wind from windbag politicians like Sherrill, Hochul and Lamont.

And no one is discussing the visual blight — seeing magnificent ocean-scapes destroyed by towering hardware across the horizon. If the Right were demanding lines of towering oil rigs across Long Island Sound or Nantucket Sound, the Left would be screaming bloody murder.

Let’s hope Trump’s pause on offshore wind turbine construction occasions an honest discussion of wind power. On the facts, instead of the lies, wind power is a loser.

At the heart of this transition is the power inverter—a critical component that converts the direct current (DC) generated by solar panels into the alternating current (AC) required for household appliances and the electrical grid. Establishing itself as a China Leading Power Inverter Exporter, MOES has recently garnered significant international attention following its high-profile participation at Intersolar Europe. By bridging the gap between raw solar harvesting and intelligent energy management, the company is redefining how residential and commercial users interact with sustainable power.

The Global Shift Toward Decarbonization and the Role of Inverter Technology

The international energy landscape is currently undergoing a structural shift. With the European Union’s commitment to the European Green Deal and similar initiatives across North America and Asia, the focus has shifted from mere energy generation to “intelligent energy autonomy.” In this context, the power inverter is no longer just a hardware bridge; it has become the “brain” of the modern energy system. Industry trends indicate a move toward hybrid systems that combine photovoltaic (PV) generation with battery storage and smart grid interaction.

Technical reliability in power inverters is the primary barrier to widespread solar adoption. Efficiency ratings, thermal management, and long-term durability are the metrics by which global exporters are judged. High-performance inverters must now manage fluctuating input voltages while maintaining a pure sine wave output to protect sensitive electronic equipment. As decentralized energy systems become more prevalent, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities into these power units is becoming a market standard. Companies that can successfully marry high-load power electronics with cloud-based monitoring are the ones currently leading the export market, providing the stability required for a carbon-neutral future.

Innovation on Display: Intersolar Europe and Market Validation

Intersolar Europe, held annually in Munich, serves as the world’s leading exhibition for the solar industry. For a specialist like MOES, the event provided a strategic platform to demonstrate its latest advancements in power conversion and smart energy ecosystems. The atmosphere at the exhibition reflected a market hungry for “plug-and-play” solutions that do not sacrifice technical depth for user-friendliness.

During the event, the MOES pavilion became a focal point for European distributors and renewable energy engineers. Visitors were particularly drawn to the real-time demonstrations of the hybrid inverter series. One recurring piece of feedback from German engineering consultants centered on the seamless integration between the inverter’s hardware and the mobile management interface. “The ability to monitor conversion efficiency and battery health in real-time through a single app changes the value proposition for the end-user,” noted one attendee. This reception at a premier global forum acts as a powerful endorsement of the company’s technical maturity and its ability to meet the stringent safety and performance standards of the European market.

The presence at Intersolar Europe also facilitated direct dialogues with project developers from the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region and South America. These interactions highlighted a growing preference for Chinese-manufactured inverters that offer high IP (Ingress Protection) ratings, capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions like high salinity or extreme heat. The success at the fair underscores a broader market trend: global buyers are increasingly looking for exporters who provide comprehensive support and integrated technology rather than just standalone components.

Technical Excellence and Integrated Smart Energy Solutions

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in the industrial hub of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, MOES has built its reputation on a dual-pillar strategy: high-quality solar products and Tuya-enabled smart home solutions. This unique positioning allows the company to offer a holistic approach to modern living that few traditional inverter manufacturers can match. By leveraging the manufacturing excellence of the Wenzhou region, the company maintains rigorous quality control while remaining agile enough to iterate on new technologies.

The core product lineup is designed to address diverse application scenarios. In residential settings, the power inverters work in tandem with smart energy meters and automated load controllers. For instance, a typical “Smart Green Home” project involves the inverter prioritizing solar consumption for heavy appliances during peak sunlight hours, then automatically switching to battery or grid power as needed—all managed through an intelligent IoT framework. In commercial projects, the focus shifts to scalability and grid stability, where MOES inverters provide robust performance in larger-scale PV arrays.

Key advantages of the MOES ecosystem include:

IoT Integration: Utilizing Tuya technology to provide users with remote control and data analytics for their energy consumption.

Sustainability-Driven Design: Products are engineered for high conversion efficiency, minimizing energy loss during the DC-to-AC process.

Versatile Application: From off-grid cabins requiring reliable stand-alone power to urban smart apartments looking to reduce carbon footprints.

Beyond the hardware, the company’s success as an exporter is rooted in its commitment to environmental responsibility and the “connected lifestyle.” By providing clean energy solutions that are easy to install and manage, the company empowers customers to take an active role in the global energy transition. This mission-driven approach, combined with the technical validation received at international exhibitions, solidifies its status as a reliable partner in the global renewable energy sector.

Summary

As the world moves toward 2030 climate goals, the synergy between green energy and intelligent automation will only become more vital. Companies that continue to innovate at the intersection of power electronics and digital connectivity are set to lead the next generation of global energy infrastructure.

New LNG demand.
Another 10 Bcf/d of new pipelines out of West Texas, plus at least 15 Bcf/d more along the coast.

LNG feedgas demand in Louisiana is projected to rise more gradually, from an already hefty 10.6 Bcf/d in 2025 to 11.7 Bcf/d in 2027 and ~16 Bcf/d in 2035.","Sure, natural gas markets have experienced plenty of changes over the past few years. Rising associated gas production in the Permian. New pipeline and storage capacity. New LNG demand. Pricing ups and downs. But we’d argue that all this was merely a prelude. That the main event — a veritable transformation of gas markets, especially along the Gulf Coast — is about to begin. A doubling of LNG demand (to 32 Bcf/d!). Another 10 Bcf/d of new pipelines out of West Texas, plus at least 15 Bcf/d more along the coast. Production revivals in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford. And don’t forget soaring demand for gas-fired power generation. In today’s RBN blog, we discuss the massive, market-transforming changes just ahead — and our upcoming GasCon 2026 conference, which is hyper-focused on this market-shifting inflection point.

With all the announcements in 2022-25 — upstream and midstream consolidation, new pipelines and storage projects, new LNG export terminals, etc. — you’d be tempted to think this has been a period of extraordinary change. And you’d be right. But the fact is, the past few years in the U.S. natural gas market have really been just a teaser, a preview, an appetizer. Now, finally, all the planning and shifting is coalescing. A major, five-year ramp-up in LNG capacity is beginning in earnest. Soaring gas demand along the Gulf Coast will support stronger gas prices and, with that, more drilling and production, not just in the Permian but the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford and, very likely, other basins further afield. And to connect the supply and demand, new multi-Bcf/d pipelines will be coming online and storage projects will be developed.

Let’s begin with the demand angle, because, despite being spurred by natural gas supply pushing out of basins like the Permian, it’s going to be the primary driver behind the upcoming market transformation. RBN’s Arrow Model, which closely monitors the planned addition of new LNG export capacity, projects that feedgas demand from LNG terminals in Texas will soar from “only” 4.5 Bcf/d in 2025 to 8.8 Bcf/d in 2027 and about 16 Bcf/d nine years from now. LNG feedgas demand in Louisiana is projected to rise more gradually, from an already hefty 10.6 Bcf/d in 2025 to 11.7 Bcf/d in 2027 and ~16 Bcf/d in 2035. (Figure 1 below shows the planned additions.) Liquefaction-train commissioning is underway at Plaquemines LNG (already consuming 3.9 Bcf/d on average in December), Golden Pass LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage III, with more to follow at these export terminals and others the next couple of years. Still more are on the way: Over the past 12 months, no fewer than six Gulf Coast LNG projects with a combined capacity of 61 MMtpa (8.1 Bcf/d) reached a final investment decision (FID): trains 4 and 5 at Rio Grande LNG, a two-train expansion at Port Arthur LNG, a small expansion at Corpus Christi Stage III, and two entirely new terminals (Venture Global’s CP2 and Woodside’s Louisiana LNG).",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2026-01/Fig1_Gulf%20Coast%20LNG%20export%20capacity.png?itok=hIzsLqOI,N,,2026-01-04 22:12:26.385451

This attracted immigrants — legal and illegal — many of whom came to rural America for economic opportunity.
This was a rare advantage for rural places with low quality of life.
But, despite what many believe, the geography of those cuts is dominated by rural places.
The deepest cuts come to Medicaid and other anti-poverty programs that see their heaviest use in rural places.","Small towns are in for a sobering stretch of economic challenges as elected officials reverse pandemic-era policies that had been reviving them.

COVID-19 was a huge, unexpected opportunity for rural America. The pandemic brought jobs and people to places that had been in decline.

One reason is the pandemic brought a sharp shift in household consumption toward goods and away from services. Rural America, the manufacturing heartland, benefited from job growth in 2022 and 2023. That growth slowed by 2024, but legislation like Sen. Todd Young’s CHIPS Act offered at least a hint that we might be entering a period of more stable factory employment.

Unlike most of the world, the U.S. economy boomed after COVID. The effects were particularly obvious in labor markets, pushing us down to the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment since the 1960s. This attracted immigrants — legal and illegal — many of whom came to rural America for economic opportunity.

This was a rare advantage for rural places with low quality of life. Economic migrants are driven more by good-paying jobs than luxuries such as walkable neighborhoods or nationally ranked schools. As was the case during the 19th and early-20th centuries, immigrants moved to places native-born Americans were fleeing.

Immigration became a once-in-a-century opportunity for rural places facing the deepest economic decline.

The pandemic also brought opportunities to rural places with high quality of life and small job markets. That’s because COVID accelerated remote work, severing the geographic ties between homes and offices and permitting families to choose rural communities while keeping their jobs.

New businesses also grew during the pandemic, bringing an excess supply of college-educated workers.

Meanwhile, rural America continued to benefit from tax policies, both federal and state. Rural Americans are older, poorer and face higher rates of disability. They pay less taxes and collect more benefits than their urban or suburban counterparts.

Indiana’s poorest rural county receives about $16,000 more per year in per-capita federal transfer payments than it pays. That same county receives $1,500 more per resident in state taxes than it pays.

Along with this, place-based economic policies favored rural counties. For example, child care tax credits, a popular state policy, did more to allow rural families to work than almost any other policy in the past half-century.

Taken together, these policies and economic realities offered rural America a brighter future. Today, everything I’ve just mentioned is at risk, or gone entirely.

The Trump administration has ended remote work for federal workers. Many states, including Indiana, have followed suit for state workers. That directly hurts rural America.

Tariffs and the trade war have reversed manufacturing employment and production. They are also eviscerating agricultural exports. Job growth effectively stopped in April. The deepest job losses are just now settling into rural America, with losses clustered in manufacturing, logistics and agriculture.

Immigration has also stopped, and with it the prospects of population growth for about two-thirds of rural counties. This loss of new families means employers won’t consider these places — they need workers. Schools will shrink, churches will lose congregants and decline will accelerate.

Federal funding will slow under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. That’s unsurprising and inevitable given our large federal debt. But, despite what many believe, the geography of those cuts is dominated by rural places.

The deepest cuts come to Medicaid and other anti-poverty programs that see their heaviest use in rural places. This will lead to the closure of a number of rural hospitals across the country by 2030, as they rely so heavily on this support.

There’s little disagreement on the magnitude of these effects in Washington, D.C., and statehouses across the country. But rural Americans voted so overwhelmingly for the GOP that neither party has much incentive to address these problems.

And so, they will come to pass until the 1 in 5 Americans who live in rural places decide the current policy environment is robbing them of a prosperous future.

Electrek reported that officials powered up Arkansas' first utility-scale wind farm, a 135-megawatt project known as Crossover Wind located in Cross County, which is west of Memphis, Tennessee. Developed by Cordelio Power, the facility is already fully operational.

""We are proud to announce that Crossover Wind is now generating electricity as the first utility-scale wind project in the state of Arkansas,"" said Nick Karambelas, Cordelio Power's chief development officer.

One aspect that has made this clean-energy solution possible is a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which will receive 100% of the project's power over that time frame. However, the county and its residents are benefiting, too. Cross County will be paid about $950,000 a year, and local landowners participating in the project will receive more than $50 million.

While large-scale clean energy projects such as wind and solar farms can be problematic for landowners, particularly those in the agriculture industry, this project is set up as a win-win for all stakeholders.

Plus, the addition of a major wind power source reduces reliance on polluting energy sources such as coal and gas, lowers electricity costs, and strengthens grid resilience — especially in regions facing growing energy demand from data centers built by companies such as Microsoft and Google. That translates to one more step toward cleaner air for communities and a safer future for all of us.

""Once you've built it, the wind is free. You just get to collect it and make some generation and sell that generation,"" Cordelio Power CEO John Carson told K8 News.

On a YouTube video covering the project, one commenter wrote: ""Clean and green! It's not about have we got oil or fossil fuels! It's about the only thing we're on is fossil fuels.""

As a Top Rated off Grid Inverter Manufacturer in China, MOES has established itself as a leader in bridging the gap between raw solar generation and usable domestic or commercial power.

Off-grid inverters act as translators between raw energy and modern life. They refine rough, fluctuating direct current into high-quality alternating current that appliances can directly absorb, ensuring that even in remote wilderness areas far from the grid, your expensive appliances can operate as safely and smoothly as in the city center. A critical differentiator in this competitive market is the rigorous adherence to international standards, most notably FCC Compliance. By meeting Federal Communications Commission standards, MOES ensures that its inverters operate without causing electromagnetic interference, a factor that serves as a powerful authoritative endorsement of the brand’s engineering precision and hardware stability. This commitment to regulatory excellence has garnered significant market recognition, particularly in regions where electronic reliability and safety are non-negotiable.

The Shift Toward Energy Sovereignty and Technological Innovation

The global energy sector is currently undergoing a paradigm shift. Driven by the twin goals of carbon neutrality and energy independence, both residential and commercial users are moving away from total reliance on centralized grids. This trend is fueled by the increasing frequency of grid instability and the rising costs of traditional electricity. In this context, the role of high-frequency and low-frequency hybrid inverters has become paramount. These devices allow users to store energy when it is abundant and deploy it when it is needed most, providing a safety net that was previously unavailable to the average consumer.

Technological importance cannot be overstated in this field. An inverter must handle fluctuating inputs from solar arrays while maintaining a steady output for sensitive electronics. MOES addresses this challenge through advanced circuit design and thermal management. By focusing on low-frequency pure sine wave technology, the company provides solutions that are capable of handling high-surge loads—such as air conditioners or heavy machinery—without compromising the lifespan of the equipment. This technical focus is the bedrock of energy security for those living in remote areas or those seeking to optimize their urban energy consumption.

Reliability Through Rigorous Certification and Real-World Application

Reliability in the solar industry is measured by longevity and performance under stress. The FCC certification held by MOES is not merely a label; it represents a comprehensive design philosophy. FCC compliance requires that the inverter’s high-speed switching components do not emit radio frequency noise that could interfere with communication devices or other household electronics. This level of shielding and circuit refinement is a hallmark of premium engineering.

This reliability is consistently demonstrated in diverse project applications. From residential rooftops in North America to remote telecommunications stations that require 24/7 uptime, MOES inverters have been deployed to solve complex energy challenges. These real-world projects highlight the company’s ability to provide high-current charging and stable voltage regulation even in environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The durability of the hardware, combined with the “set it and forget it” nature of the intelligent control systems, makes these products a preferred choice for long-term investments in renewable energy.

Technical Superiority: Pure Sine Wave and Hybrid Integration

One of the most significant technical hurdles for off-grid systems is the quality of the AC output. Many lower-tier manufacturers produce “modified sine waves,” which can damage sensitive appliances over time. MOES has dedicated its R&D efforts to perfecting the Low-Frequency Pure Sine Wave Hybrid Solar Inverter. This specific technology ensures that the electricity produced is as clean, or cleaner, than the power provided by the public utility grid.

The hybrid nature of these inverters allows for seamless switching between solar power, battery storage, and even backup generators or the utility grid if available. This versatility is essential for commercial applications where downtime translates directly into financial loss. Furthermore, the integration of high-performance chargers within the inverter unit simplifies the overall system architecture, reducing the number of failure points and making the installation process more straightforward for technicians and DIY enthusiasts alike.

Strategic Manufacturing and the Wenzhou Excellence

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in the industrial hub of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, MOES leverages the region’s long-standing reputation for electrical engineering excellence. Wenzhou is globally recognized for its sophisticated supply chains and manufacturing precision, which allows MOES to maintain rigorous quality control standards that many international competitors struggle to match.

The company’s dual focus—specializing in both solar energy products and smart home solutions—creates a unique synergy. While many manufacturers view the inverter as a standalone component, MOES treats it as part of a broader, connected ecosystem. By integrating Tuya-enabled IoT technology, the company allows users to monitor and manage their energy production and consumption in real-time through intelligent automation. This fusion of green energy and smart technology reflects a deep understanding of the modern “connected lifestyle,” where efficiency is managed through a smartphone screen rather than a manual switchboard.

A Sustainable Vision for a Connected Future

As we look toward the next decade, the integration of clean energy and intelligent automation will define the standard of living. MOES’s mission is to empower global customers with tools that promote environmental responsibility without sacrificing convenience. The company’s trajectory from its 2008 founding to becoming a globally recognized name in solar technology is a testament to its focus on “sustainable innovation.”

By maintaining a presence in major international exhibitions and continuously updating its product portfolio to meet evolving technical standards, MOES remains at the forefront of the industry. The transition to a smarter, greener future requires more than just hardware; it requires a commitment to quality, a deep understanding of user needs, and the technical prowess to deliver on those promises. Whether for a small cabin in the woods or a large-scale commercial facility, the off-grid solutions provided by MOES represent the pinnacle of reliability and intelligent design.

BYD sold 2.26 million EVs in 2025, while Tesla’s deliveries fell 8% year-on-year to 1.64 million units. The shift marks a significant milestone in the global EV market, with the Chinese manufacturer claiming the crown Tesla had held since becoming the world’s most valuable automaker.

Tesla reported fourth-quarter deliveries of 418,227 vehicles, falling short of analyst expectations of 449,000 units according to FactSet consensus. The disappointing quarter capped off a challenging year for the company, which faced headwinds from policy changes and increased competition.

Multiple factors weigh on Tesla

The elimination of a US$7,500 (AUD$13,000) tax credit in the United States at the end of September 2025 contributed to Tesla’s sales decline, with industry observers noting that EV demand requires time to rebalance following such policy changes.

Tesla’s performance was also affected by CEO Musk’s political support of US President Donald Trump and other right wing politicians, which impacted sales in key markets. The company has simultaneously grappled with intensifying competition from BYD and other Chinese manufacturers, as well as European automotive giants.

Wedbush Securities analysts noted that Tesla faces a “more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.” The company continues to face regulatory approval challenges in Europe related to self-driving technology, with sales potentially rebounding once these hurdles are cleared.

BYD’s rapid ascent

Shenzhen-based BYD, known by its English slogan “Build Your Dreams,” was founded in 1995 and originally specialised in battery manufacturing. The company has come to dominate China’s highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term encompassing fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

BYD is now expanding its presence overseas as increasingly price-conscious consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability. While the company faces hefty tariffs in the US market alongside other Chinese EV producers, its success is growing in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

The competition between Tesla and BYD was close in 2024, with Tesla’s 1.79 million EVs narrowly outpacing BYD’s 1.76 million units. However, BYD’s record 2025 performance has established a clear gap between the two manufacturers.

Market outlook

Tesla shares closed 2.6% down in New York following the delivery announcement. Despite the disappointing figures, Wedbush analysts noted that Tesla’s quarterly sales remained better than some had speculated.

The analysts highlighted that “sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations, which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe.”

For Australian consumers, the global shift in EV leadership could signal increased competition and potentially more choice as BYD continues its international expansion, while Tesla works to address regulatory challenges and restore growth momentum.",https://autotalk.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/byd-atto2-rear-688x459-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:59:30.344059

One of the leading moves in this space is a cryogenic technology that delivers precisely such long-duration storage – the use of liquid air to deliver stored energy.
On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is a UK company called Highview Power that is now making serious strides.
“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.
On tech and analytics Butland says Highview’s capabilities lie in power generation through its cryogenic tech but also substantially in its grid analytics capabilities.","As the energy transition builds, and renewable energy grows in the mix, the question of how to store electricity most effectively for grid flexibility has been climbing the agenda. Gas-fired power plants are the most common fast-response option of choice today, increasingly allied to lithium-ion batteries to manage short-duration balancing challenges.

But it is well understood that another piece in the puzzle is needed in the form of low-carbon long-duration energy storage. This means large stores of low- or zero-carbon energy that can be accessed and used from four to up to 20 hours at a time, and sometimes even longer.

One of the leading moves in this space is a cryogenic technology that delivers precisely such long-duration storage – the use of liquid air to deliver stored energy.

On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is a UK company called Highview Power that is now making serious strides. And more than a decade on from proving its technology with a small-scale pilot project near London, a first commercial-scale plant is taking shape, to be followed by four much larger plants by 2030, with two to be built in Scotland and two in England.

Each of the four larger planned UK facilities is a 2.5GWh plant and due to come onstream by 2030, but before that Highview is delivering a smaller project at Carrington near Manchester, in north-west England.

“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.

“Once connected to the grid, it can deliver 50MW of output and 300MWh of storage using our proprietary tech. That 50MW output equates to delivering up to 100MW of grid stability, which you could say is the functional purpose.”

The plant encompasses compression, liquefaction, and storage of air, ready for regasification and being put through a steam turbine to make electricity.

“It is a very flexible technology because it is modular by design. It makes it easy to adjust the output based on need, and that’s crucial” says Butland.

The Carrington plant should be ready to switch on in the first quarter of 2026 and will serve as an important test-case for Highview.

On tech and analytics

Butland says Highview’s capabilities lie in power generation through its cryogenic tech but also substantially in its grid analytics capabilities.

“You could even say the analytics side is becoming even more important as a differentiator,” he muses. “Four years ago we realised we needed to invest in our analytics function in order to deliver and integrate our technologies, and that’s an investment that has really helped us to turn a corner and maximise our grid insights and control, as well as helping drive wider decisions around grid investments.”

Among its capabilities, Highview is now able to use its analytics to work with governments on identifying grid vulnerabilities and illustrating how, where and why its cryogenic tech would be best deployed, as well as other ways that grids can be reshaped for the future.

“Our modelling is able to show what is needed in a particular location,” says Butland. “With today’s changing and more distributed electricity grids, the requirements to manage grids are more complex than ever and we can deliver a level of insight that is crucial when it comes to planning for tomorrow.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/05/Highview-Power-LAES-Storage-Facility51.jpg",N,,2026-01-04 19:59:48.119694

With Tesla announcing vehicle deliveries that were better than expected despite concerns, analysts say the company has demonstrated a solid foundation for future growth.
Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap within the next year, and in a bullish scenario, could achieve a $3 trillion market cap by the end of 2026.” He particularly described Tesla’s robotaxi ‘Cybercab’ as a “golden goose,” predicting it will be a core driver that will substantially boost the company’s AI valuation.
Ives estimated, “Tesla has at least $1 trillion in potential value from its AI and autonomous driving businesses alone.
In a bullish scenario, where federal regulatory hurdles surrounding FSD and autonomous driving are resolved within the next three to six months and the autonomous driving and robotics roadmap enters full-scale mass production, the stock price could rise to $800.”","On January 5, Wedbush Securities stated that Tesla could capture about 70% of the global autonomous driving market over the next decade and that it is possible for the company’s market capitalization to reach $2 trillion within a year. The firm maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating and set a price target of $600.

With Tesla announcing vehicle deliveries that were better than expected despite concerns, analysts say the company has demonstrated a solid foundation for future growth. In the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla delivered 418,200 vehicles (down 16% year-on-year), slightly below the market consensus of 422,900 units, but above the so-called whisper numbers, which were around 410,000 units.

Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, commented, “Given that demand has weakened further following the expiration of electric vehicle (EV) tax credits and that the European market remains a challenge, these are relatively solid results. This indicates that Tesla is gradually building a foundation for growth beyond 2026.” Ives, a renowned technology stock analyst on Wall Street known for his accurate predictions, is a long-time Tesla bull and well-known among retail investors.

Tesla’s FSD (Full Self-Driving) technology is facing difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval in Europe, making an immediate recovery in sales unlikely. Ives explained, “It is highly likely that the approval process will be completed in the first half of 2026. Better-than-expected growth figures in smaller and emerging markets may partially offset the slowdown currently seen in major markets such as China and Europe.”

Tesla’s specific business strategies and mid- to long-term outlook are expected to be further clarified during the fourth-quarter earnings conference call scheduled for the 28th. Ives asserted, “AI valuation will emerge as a key point throughout 2026. Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap within the next year, and in a bullish scenario, could achieve a $3 trillion market cap by the end of 2026.” He particularly described Tesla’s robotaxi ‘Cybercab’ as a “golden goose,” predicting it will be a core driver that will substantially boost the company’s AI valuation.

Ives estimated, “Tesla has at least $1 trillion in potential value from its AI and autonomous driving businesses alone. In a bullish scenario, where federal regulatory hurdles surrounding FSD and autonomous driving are resolved within the next three to six months and the autonomous driving and robotics roadmap enters full-scale mass production, the stock price could rise to $800.”",https://cphoto.asiae.co.kr/listimglink/6/2025091608592734274_1757980767.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:59:42.201661

Last week, the Trump administration suspended leases for five large offshore wind projects that are under construction off the U.S. East Coast over what it called national security concerns, sending shares of offshore wind companies plunging.

The suspension was the latest blow for offshore wind developers that have faced repeated disruptions to their multi-billion-dollar projects under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said he finds wind turbines ugly, costly and inefficient.

Denmark’s Orsted said on Friday it was challenging the U.S. government’s suspension of the lease for its Revolution Wind joint venture and would seek a court injunction against the decision to halt its $5 billion offshore wind project.

Equinor said filing for a preliminary injunction is necessary to keep the project on track during this critical execution phase and avoid further commercial and financing impacts if the order remains in effect.

Tesla delivered 1.64 million EVs in 2025, down from 1.79 million in 2024, while BYD achieved record sales of 2.26 million electric vehicles for the year. The shift marks the end of Tesla’s dominance in the global EV market and highlights the growing influence of Chinese manufacturers.

Tesla’s fourth-quarter deliveries of 418,227 units fell short of analyst expectations of 449,000, according to FactSet consensus data. The company’s struggles come despite CEO Elon Musk’s high-profile leadership and Tesla’s established market presence.

Multiple headwinds impact Tesla

Several factors contributed to Tesla’s declining performance throughout 2025. The elimination of a US$7500 tax credit in the United States at the end of September 2025 created a significant headwind for EV demand, with industry observers noting the market needs time to rebalance.

Tesla also faced challenges related to Musk’s political activities, with his support of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians affecting demand in key markets. The company has simultaneously grappled with intensifying competition from BYD and other Chinese manufacturers, as well as European automotive giants.

Wedbush Securities analysts noted Tesla’s quarterly sales figure remained better than some had speculated, but flagged the company faces a “more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.”

BYD’s rapid ascent

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, unveiled its record EV sales figures following Tesla’s announcement. The company, known as “Biyadi” in Chinese or by the English slogan “Build Your Dreams,” was founded in 1995 and originally specialised in battery manufacturing.

BYD has dominated China’s highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term encompassing fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. China represents the world’s largest market for new energy vehicles.

The company is now expanding its overseas presence as increasingly price-conscious consumption patterns in China impact profitability. While BYD and other Chinese EV producers face substantial tariffs in the US market, the company has found success in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

Market implications

Tesla shares closed 2.6% down in New York following the sales announcement. The narrow margin between the companies in 2024 – when Tesla’s 1.79 million sales barely outpaced BYD’s 1.76 million – indicated the competitive shift was imminent.

Wedbush Securities analysts noted Tesla still faces regulatory approval challenges in Europe relating to self-driving technology, with sales potentially rebounding once these hurdles are cleared. They added that “sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations, which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe.”

Aiming to get back on a growth track, the company has just launched the Roadster X, the first EV motorcycle with a range of over 500 km. However, it may not be the solution to boost volumes and profits.

McD tracks new vehicle registrations across 97+ countries worldwide, reporting data based on the calendar year. When comparing the data reported by us to that declared by manufacturers, it’s important to note that manufacturers typically report their “sales” (vehicles invoiced), which often differ from “registrations” due to variations in their fiscal year reporting.

Global Sales Performance

In 2024, all winds were favorable for Indian startups, and before going public, sales were boosted by strong government incentives for EV models and by the delay of major manufacturers in introducing electric vehicles (EVs).

Additionally, profitability was not yet a major concern, and Ola was able to offer electric scooters at a very competitive price, achieving immediate success by selling over 400K EVs in a single calendar year. The company shared the optimistic vision of being able to sell millions of EVs in the near future.

However, after becoming a public company, profitability became a key factor. The management had to increase prices, just as major OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) began pushing into the EV market and the government decided to reduce incentives for the sector.

As a result, 2025 became a nightmare, with sales dropping by nearly half, to 199,319 units, and the business outlook became completely different from the optimistic narrative prior to the company’s IPO.

2026 Company’s Goals

This year’s goal will be to get back on a positive track, rebuilding credibility after the rapid decline following the public listing (with the company’s shares starting 2026 nearly 50% below their peak) and finding a position amid the growing competition.

A potential milestone on this path could be the Roadster X, the company’s first electric motorcycle, which has just been launched in India. The motorcycle has been presented with outstanding technical features and an impressive world-best range of 500 km.

However, the motorcycle segment in India is currently almost nonexistent, and the potential customer base for this model represents a small niche within the vast local market. We doubt that it can drive a significant shift for the company in terms of sales, especially considering the consistent investment required for its development.

Ola Electric Heritage

Ola Electric Mobility was founded in 2017 in Bangalore, Karnataka (India), with the goal of producing electric two- and three-wheelers powered entirely by electric engines and 100% renewable energy.

The manufacturing facility is located in Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu (India), on a 500-acre site. It is likely the largest two-wheeler manufacturing facility in the world, known as the Future Factory, and was built with a US$324 million investment.

Production began in December 2021, and by the 2023 calendar year, the company had taken the lead in the Indian electric two-wheeler segment.

The company also manufactures battery cells at its facility in Tamil Nadu, which supply energy storage solutions for its vehicles and other applications. The plant, called the Giga-Factory, is set to become operational at the start of 2025.

But it would also create a state-level repository of data center proposals, making it easier to keep track of proposals.
She expects data center players to argue that onerous regulations could cause data centers to seek sites in nearby states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Maryland.
“As other states aggressively compete for data center investment, Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” reads the August report.
“By welcoming responsible data center development, Maryland can address its immediate fiscal and economic challenges while positioning itself as a leader in the digital economy for decades to come.","The proposals seem to be cropping up left and right.

A vacant Social Security building in Baltimore County. A former power plant in Montgomery. An old mall site in Prince George’s. And that’s on top of a data center campus that has long been under development on a former industrial site in Frederick County.

It’s likely that large scale data centers, which have a large presence in neighboring Virginia, will make their way to Maryland in greater numbers in the years ahead. Yet, there isn’t a cohesive statewide policy regulating the arrival of these facilities, which demand immense amounts of energy. Instead, local jurisdictions wield much of the power to approve or deny projects through zoning rules.

“Local governments can make decisions that affect the entire state,” said Dave Arndt, co-chair of the Maryland Legislative Coalition Climate Justice Wing, who focuses on data centers. “If they approve a very large hyperscale data center that requires new transmission lines, new distribution lines and a new substation — and uses the same amount of electricity as the city of Baltimore — that’s going to increase our rates.”

During the coming General Assembly session, data center regulations are likely to draw some interest, as Maryland’s grid operator continues to issue dire warnings about just how much energy they’re projected to demand — and how that could send energy prices soaring ever further.

Perhaps one needn’t look any further than December’s special session, during which lawmakers overrode Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) veto of a study to evaluate data centers’ potential impact on the state, one of several studies the governor rejected.

Speaking from the Senate floor about the study, Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County) said his office learned over the summer about the data center proposal in Woodlawn — in his district — and has been in “fact-finding mode” ever since.

“The experts are adamant that across the country, and here in Maryland, we are currently rushing to approve data center projects through a poorly planned, chaotic process that lacks a foolproof regulatory framework to protect our communities from harm,” Sydnor said.

Sydnor argued that data center projects seem to offer benefits “only for the wealthy,” while the costs “are socialized for everyone else.”

Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), speaking for an override of the governor’s veto, said looming data centers have “a very real impact. Frederick County is the first that has really started to develop our data center platforms, and right now we’re looking at a 2,200-acre parcel.”

Last session, the legislature integrated a few data center regulations in a broader package of energy reforms. For example, one provision required electric utilities to create new rate schedules for large-load customers such as data centers — subject to approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC).

“It is the intent of the General Assembly that residential retail electric customers in the State should not bear the financial risks associated with large load customers interconnecting to the electric system serving the State,” read the bill, which Moore signed in May.

But it seems clear more rule changes are coming.

For his part, the governor argues that the state should open its doors to data centers — but not without constraints.

“I do not believe in the false choice that oftentimes is being laid out: That it’s either we let Big Tech do whatever they want, and we turn intoo Northern Virginia, or it’s, don’t allow any type of economic development in the state,” Moore said during a recent news conference. “I don’t think either one of those answers are right.”

In 2024, Moore’s administration proposed a bill exempting data centers’ diesel-powered backup generators from scrutiny by the PSC, which passed.

In his recent remarks, Moore said he envisions a process where state officials work with the impacted community, local officials and environmental groups to determine how data centers considering Maryland can contribute using “best practices,” including by bringing their own power generation along with them.

Data center woes at PJM

Under current policies, all electricity ratepayers share the costs of system expansion and maintenance. But there’s a growing push to require very large users to fund the power boosts that they require.

Leaders at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, which includes Maryland, Washington, D.C., and a dozen other states, are currently considering a host of possible policy changes related to data centers. They’re expected to make a decision in January, after which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gets to make the final call.

A proposal from state governors, including Moore, called for PJM to provide incentives for data centers to bring their own power generation. A proposal from state lawmakers, including several Marylanders, would require PJM to curtail power to data centers in emergencies if they do not bring their own generation.

The need for regulatory change appears dire. At its energy capacity auction in December, PJM failed to procure all of the energy that it deemed necessary for the 2027-2028 delivery year — and the projected demand from data centers was largely to blame.

The shortfall doesn’t mean that the grid won’t be able to serve customers during the delivery year. But PJM aims to have a 20% reserve margin for power system emergencies, and it only secured 14.8%.

The shortage happened because PJM projections show there will be an increase of nearly 5,100 megawatts worth of data center demand for those years, though there is worry that the demand is being over-counted as data centers talk to multiple power companies about the same project.

PJM officials are optimistic that their policy changes could reduce the shortfall by lowering the projected toll of data centers.

“There are factors here that lead us to believe that we will actually be closer to the … standard once the delivery year arrives, because of things that we expect to change between now and 2027,” said Stu Bressler, executive vice president of market services and strategy at PJM.

Maryland isn’t ‘negotiating with an empty hand’

At the same time, Maryland is eyeing policy changes of its own.

Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), said she is working on a bill that would require all data centers of a certain size to receive a certificate to operate from the PSC.

She argues that the bill would provide a new layer of state scrutiny focused on energy usage, going beyond the current permitting regime at the Maryland Department of the Environment, which is more focused on emissions and site conditions. But it would also create a state-level repository of data center proposals, making it easier to keep track of proposals.

“It’s basically a transparency bill, so that we’ll have everything in one place at the state,” Hester said.

Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said she is crafting a bill that would encourage data centers to curtail their power usage during peak periods, such as hot days, when the electrical system is taxed by heavy usage of air conditioners. The electrical system is built around withstanding the peaks, Charkoudian said, even though most of the year, the system is far from maxed out.

“I’m really focused on: When data centers are coming online in Maryland, how can they be part of the solution for the 100 hours a year where their presence is going to lead to driving up costs?” Charkoudian said.

Data centers could reduce their usage by moving particular work to non-peak periods, or pre-cooling their equipment to avoid cooling during the hottest time of the day, when the grid will be most taxed, Charkoudian said.

Charkoudian said her bill will also incentivize data centers to build battery energy storage facilities in their areas, so that they could turn to stored power during peak periods.

Arndt from the Climate Justice Wing called Charkoudian’s bill a “win-win-win situation.”

“They [data centers] stay operational. The grid stays operational. We win because we don’t have to build new peaker plants,” Arndt said, referring to plants that are called on in peak demand periods.

But it’s important that the bill continue to ensure that data centers use clean backup power during peak periods, rather than relying on fossil fuel backup generators, Arndt cautioned.

“We don’t want diesel generators running for four hours in a community just because we’re running low on energy.” Arndt said.

Angie McCarthy, Maryland conservation advocate at Nature Forward, said her group supports Charkoudian’s bill, though she knows it won’t come without controversy. She expects data center players to argue that onerous regulations could cause data centers to seek sites in nearby states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Maryland.

“From our perspective, Maryland is seen as a prime spot for data center development, because we have such access to the fiber-optic cables and other infrastructure that Virginia has installed in their state,” McCarthy said. “We aren’t negotiating with an empty hand.”

The Maryland Tech Council, a trade association representing technology companies, has focused much of its recent messaging on the economic boost that data centers can bring to the state.

A typical 800,000 square foot data center produces about 5,000 jobs during construction, along with $775 million in economic activity and $18 million in state tax revenue, according to a Tech Council report issued in August. During operation, a typical facility spurs 500 permanent jobs, $31 million in annual compensation and $14 million in annual state tax revenue, according to the study, conducted by the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based firm led by economist Anirban Basu.

In a more recent report, the Tech Council zeroed in on Prince George’s County, arguing that a “mid-sized” data center development would generate over $1 billion in economic activity during construction, and $20 million in annual tax revenue for the county.

“As other states aggressively compete for data center investment, Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” reads the August report. “By welcoming responsible data center development, Maryland can address its immediate fiscal and economic challenges while positioning itself as a leader in the digital economy for decades to come. The time to act is now; before this opportunity, like so many others, migrates to neighboring states with more favorable business environments.”",https://www.citybiz.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Data-center.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:59:51.515372

Sweden’s state-owned LKAB is relocating the entire Arctic town of Kiruna to access the Per Geijer deposit, Europe’s largest rare earth resource at approximately 2.2 million tonnes, as part of the continent’s push for mineral independence from China.

While the deposit scale is significant, Europe still lacks commercial-scale separation, refining capacity, and magnet manufacturing—meaning a resource discovery alone won’t break China’s 90%+ downstream dominance.

For U.S. stakeholders, Kiruna signals allied mineral realism but underscores the urgent need for coordinated transatlantic investment in processing infrastructure, not just upstream mining.

A recent Oilprice.com feature (opens in a new tab) by Tsvetana Paraskova captures a striking image: Sweden’s mining champion LKAB (opens in a new tab) relocating the Arctic town of Kiruna—including its 113-year-old wooden church—as mine expansion and ground subsidence make the move unavoidable. The visuals are dramatic, but the strategic subtext matters far more. Beneath Kiruna lies the Per Geijer deposit, which LKAB has reported at more than one million tonnes of rare earth oxides—with later disclosures suggesting ~2.2 million tonnes in situ—widely regarded as the largest known rare earth resource in Europe. For a continent anxious about China’s dominance in rare earths, the symbolism is powerful: Europe is literally moving a town to keep critical minerals accessible.

LKAB: A Heavyweight With a Long Horizon

Founded in 1890, LKAB (Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag) is a wholly state-owned Swedish mining group, headquartered in Luleå, with core operations in Kiruna and Gällivare. It is one of the world’s leading suppliers of high-grade magnetite iron ore pellets and fines, serving steelmakers across Europe and Asia. Beyond iron ore, LKAB produces industrial minerals and provides drilling systems and engineering services globally. Strategically, the company positions itself at the forefront of decarbonizing heavy industry, targeting carbon-free steelmaking processes by 2045 through innovations such as green sponge iron and energy-efficient pelletizing. This long-cycle, state-backed mandate shapes how Kiruna’s rare earth potential should be interpreted.

What the Story Gets Right—and Where It Leans

The article is solid on fundamentals. LKAB has publicly confirmed the scale of the Per Geijer resource, and the International Energy Agency consistently underscores the extreme concentration of the rare earth supply chain. China’s dominance—roughly 60% of mining, over 90% of refining, and nearly all permanent magnet manufacturing—is not overstated. Kiruna therefore represents a genuine upstream diversification signal.

Where optimism quietly outruns reality is downstream. A deposit does not equal independence as _Rare Earth Exchanges_™ continuously chronicles. Europe still lacks commercial-scale separation capacity, solvent expertise, and magnet manufacturing depth. Environmental permitting, radioactive by-product handling, and capital intensity remain formidable hurdles. The narrative edges toward inevitability when execution risk is, in fact, substantial.

Why This Still Matters for the U.S.

For American investors and policymakers, Kiruna is asignal, not a solution. It shows allied nations waking up to mineral realism—but without coordinated transatlantic investment in processing and magnets, China’s structural advantage remains intact. Moving a town is bold. Building a supply chain is harder.

In my earlier scenario of maritime shipping decarbonization, I projected that most of the visible progress over the next two decades would come from inland shipping, ports, and short sea routes rather than from transoceanic vessels.
The evidence from ports and inland shipping shows that working outward from what is feasible now delivers faster, more durable progress.
When viewed through that lens, CATL’s Ship-Shore-Cloud strategy looks less like a product announcement and more like an operating system for maritime electrification.
That strategy is reinforced by national Chinese policies that emphasize electrifying inland shipping and ports using technologies that are already commercially viable, rather than deferring action in favor of speculative fuel pathways.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

CATL’s batteries and energy management systems are already operating in roughly 900 ships and vessels, a figure that on its own should reframe how maritime decarbonization is discussed. Shipping is conservative for structural reasons tied to safety, long asset lifetimes, and unforgiving certification regimes, so deployment at this scale signals that electrification is no longer a pilot exercise but operating infrastructure. While much of the public debate remains focused on alternative fuels that are expensive, supply constrained, or operationally complex, electrification has been advancing quietly in the parts of maritime transport where it actually works today.

That reality became clearer when CATL—China’s and the world’s largest battery company—, through its marine subsidiary Contemporary Amperex Electric Vessel (CAEV), unveiled its Ship-Shore-Cloud electric vessel solution at Marintec China 2025 in early December. The announcement was not framed around a single battery product or a demonstration vessel, but around integration across the full operating stack. Onboard, CATL combines batteries, power electronics, propulsion integration, and control systems into certified packages designed for multi-decade service. Onshore, it pairs those systems with charging and battery swapping infrastructure, including a separation of ship and battery model that lowers upfront capital requirements and reallocates risk. At the cloud layer, fleet operators gain continuous monitoring, scheduling, maintenance planning, and optimization across entire fleets. The underlying premise is straightforward. Fragmented supplier models create coordination failures, unclear accountability, and avoidable downtime over a 30 year asset life, while integrated systems reduce operational risk and lifecycle cost.

The significance of that approach becomes clearer when examined against the vessels already operating at scale. CATL’s systems power Changjiangsanxia 1, a roughly 100 meter all electric inland passenger ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers daily on the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges region. Along China’s coast, the Yujian 77 electric passenger vessel operates on short sea routes in places such as Xiamen Bay, meeting China Classification Society requirements for corrosion resistance, redundancy, and marine safety in saltwater conditions that are far harsher than inland rivers. In ports, hybrid tugboats such as Qinggang Tug 1 are handling high transient power demands during ship assist operations, demonstrating that batteries can absorb peak loads and cut diesel use and local air pollution in dense harbor environments.

On the cargo side, the Jining 6006 electric vessel is moving freight along sections of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal using containerized battery swapping, where batteries are exchanged in minutes rather than hours, showing that downtime rather than energy density is often the real constraint for commercial operations. Two sister 700 TEU battery-electric container ships, N997 and N998, built for COSCO Shipping Development and operating on the Yangtze River with swappable containerized batteries, do not use CATL systems but are still indicative of how quickly large-scale inland container shipping is moving toward electrification in China. These deployments are not fringe experiments. They sit squarely in inland waterways, coastal passenger routes, ports, and canals, precisely where electrification is most practical and where emissions have the greatest impact on nearby communities.

The strategic context sharpened further in 2025 when CATL and A.P. Moller Maersk formalized a series of agreements spanning ports, terminals, and logistics. Through Maersk’s terminal arm APM Terminals, CATL batteries are being deployed into electrified container handling equipment and terminal vehicles, a segment where electrification is already economically compelling due to predictable duty cycles, centralized charging, and clear total cost advantages. I’ve spent considerable time talking with Sahar Rashidbeigi about APM Terminal’s electrification efforts under her four years leading the effort, now over as she has taken a new role as VP Decarbonization for the Royal Carribean Group cruise line company.

Beyond terminals, the broader CATL–Maersk strategic partnership positions CATL as a preferred battery and energy technology partner across logistics and supply chains. For Maersk, the value lies in decarbonizing assets without compromising reliability or competitiveness. For CATL, the value lies in embedding its technology into a global operational platform where scale, standards, and learning effects reinforce each other. Clearly Maersk is seeing the strong advantages of electrification of as much of the supply chain it operates as possible.

This trajectory aligns closely with the multi decade port electrification strategy I have laid out in my earlier work. In that analysis, I argued that ports function most effectively as energy hubs rather than fuel depots, because electricity scales incrementally, integrates cleanly with grids, and improves reliability instead of introducing new handling risks. The sequencing matters. Ground equipment electrifies first because the technology is mature and the economics are already favorable. Harbor craft follow because their duty cycles are short, predictable, and power intensive. Shore power then becomes routine for vessels at berth, eliminating auxiliary engine use in precisely the places where air pollution is most visible and politically sensitive. Grid capacity and onshore and offshore renewables expand alongside these changes as demand materializes, rather than being built speculatively in advance. Only after these steps are well underway does it make sense to address the hardest segments of deep sea shipping. This is not an abstract preference. It is an operational strategy that builds infrastructure, workforce capability, regulatory familiarity, and confidence while delivering emissions and cost reductions at each stage.

In my earlier scenario of maritime shipping decarbonization, I projected that most of the visible progress over the next two decades would come from inland shipping, ports, and short sea routes rather than from transoceanic vessels. Inland waterways and coastal services have constrained ranges, centralized charging opportunities, and fixed schedules, all of which favor battery electric propulsion. Ports, meanwhile, are stationary energy consumers that can anchor grid upgrades, renewable integration, and storage, creating spillover benefits for surrounding industries. As these systems scale, batteries become cheaper, operational data accumulates, and standards harden, further lowering barriers to adoption. None of this requires breakthroughs. It requires deployment.

My view on deep sea shipping has always been more conditional. Long haul ocean vessels face genuine energy density constraints that batteries alone cannot solve today, and pretending otherwise does not help the sector. That does not mean decarbonization stalls. It means the pathway is slower and more selective. Operational changes such as speed reductions deliver immediate emissions cuts. Hybridization allows batteries to cover port entry, maneuvering, and auxiliary loads, shrinking fuel demand even when liquid fuels remain necessary. Sustainable biofuels have a role in that context, not as a universal solution but as a limited substitute where electrification cannot yet reach. As I noted after working with TenneT in The Netherlands in the summer of 2025 on their 2050 full country energy decarbonization scenario, core discussions of the economic merit order of aviation versus shipping demand for the feedstocks most suitable for making aviation fuels led to my assumption that biomethanol would be a dominant shipping fuel after all. Subsequent assessment of US corn ethanol futures and an ongoing research effort on pathways to aviation fuels from waste biomass and agricultural feedstocks—expect a series including updates to my aviation scenario soon—lead me to believe that ethanol will also be a likely shipping fuel, especially for ships bunkering in US and Brazilian ports.

Over time, as ports become fully electrified energy hubs and short sea routes normalize electric propulsion, the pressure on deep sea shipping eases because a growing share of maritime activity has already decarbonized and global shipping of fossil fuels—40% of total shipping tonnage today—and raw iron ore—another 15%—will be in structural decline. The mistake is to treat the hardest problem as the first one to solve. The evidence from ports and inland shipping shows that working outward from what is feasible now delivers faster, more durable progress.

When viewed through that lens, CATL’s Ship-Shore-Cloud strategy looks less like a product announcement and more like an operating system for maritime electrification. Integrated onboard systems depend on standardized shore charging, grid upgrades and energy management. Fleet-level monitoring reduces downtime and clarifies accountability across decades of operation, while battery swapping and service models smooth adoption by shifting capital and performance risk. Many battery suppliers sell components into this ecosystem. CATL is positioning itself as a platform provider spanning assets, infrastructure, and operational data.

China’s national policy environment reinforces that positioning. Inland shipping and ports sit squarely within China’s dual carbon objectives of peaking emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2060, with national and provincial policies emphasizing low carbon ports, electrification of port equipment, expansion of shore power, and modernization of inland waterways. Rivers such as the Yangtze carry immense freight volumes through dense population centers, with predictable routes and centralized nodes that favor electrification earlier than almost anywhere else. Policy support, industrial capacity, and domestic scale combine to create learning curves that compound quickly, allowing standards proven at home to become export standards as deployments accumulate.

CATL is not operating in isolation, even if it is the most visible player at scale. Other Chinese battery manufacturers are already active in or moving decisively toward the maritime space, drawing on the same industrial strengths that reshaped automotive electrification. BYD, through its energy storage and marine subsidiaries, has supplied batteries and complete electric propulsion systems for ferries and workboats, particularly in coastal and inland applications. EVE Energy has obtained marine certifications and is supplying lithium iron phosphate cells and packs into electric and hybrid vessels, often through partnerships with ship system integrators. CALB and Gotion High-Tech are also present, supplying cells and modules used in marine energy storage systems that meet classification society requirements. In parallel, firms such as Lishen, Sunwoda, Great Power, and REPT are positioning their products for maritime use, leveraging scale from automotive and stationary storage markets. What distinguishes this group collectively is not just manufacturing capacity, but proximity to Chinese shipyards and system integrators, which allows batteries, power electronics, and energy management systems to be designed into vessels from the outset. The result is a deep and growing ecosystem of Chinese battery suppliers capable of supporting electrified shipping, even as CATL remains the clear leader in integration, deployment count, and strategic reach.

This stands in sharp contrast to the role the United States has played, where federal policy has actively attacked or undermined progress rather than merely failing to lead. By scuttling decarbonization measures at the International Maritime Organization, the United States has injected uncertainty into a sector that depends on long lived assets and stable standards. That uncertainty has predictable effects. Shipowners will delay retrofits, many ports will hesitate on grid and shore power investments, and capital will wait for clearer signals, even where electric solutions are already viable.

The structural reasons for this posture are not subtle. The United States has a lagging battery manufacturing sector compared with China, no meaningful commercial shipbuilding industry at scale—South Korea, Japan, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Finland each have larger commercial shipbuilding industries than the United States, even though taken together they have a smaller combined population and less than half the GDP of the country—, and a Jones Act regime that sharply limits domestic vessel competition and renewal. Those constraints inhibit electrification of vessels operating in US, Canadian and Mexican waters and make it difficult for American firms to compete with companies like CATL that combine battery manufacturing scale, certified marine systems, and integration across ships, ports, and operations. Instead of addressing those weaknesses, US policy has leaned toward blocking international progress, which slows global decarbonization while doing little to improve domestic competitiveness. The result is a widening gap between countries aligning policy with industrial reality and those attempting to defend legacy structures that no longer match the direction of maritime technology.

Europe occupies a middle ground in maritime electrification, with a shipbuilding industry far smaller than China’s but still robust and globally relevant, and a narrower battery manufacturing base. It has combined port electrification with real-world shipping deployments under a strong policy push, pairing shore power mandates, carbon pricing through the EU emissions trading system, and regulations such as FuelEU Maritime with large-scale demonstrations of battery-electric and hybrid vessels. Electrification of ferries is already routine in Norway, Denmark, Scotland, and the Baltic on fixed routes, while ports across the EU are upgrading grids and berth infrastructure in response to binding decarbonization targets that are steadily reshaping both port operations and short-sea shipping. It will still electrify much more slowly than China, but the Maersk-CATL agreements promise to speed this considerably.

Taken together, these dynamics support a clear conclusion. CATL, as China’s and the world’s leading battery manufacturer, is positioning itself to become the dominant global player in port and shipping electrification, combining manufacturing scale, certified marine technology, integrated service models, and anchor partnerships with operators such as Maersk. That strategy is reinforced by national Chinese policies that emphasize electrifying inland shipping and ports using technologies that are already commercially viable, rather than deferring action in favor of speculative fuel pathways. The result is not a promise about the distant future of shipping, but a concrete reshaping of how large parts of the sector are already operating.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini_Generated_Image_s3es6qs3es6qs3es-800x442.png,N,,2026-01-04 15:57:57.436118

Rivian is now hanging its future on the more affordable R2, due out this year, as well as improvements to its autonomous driving platform and a technical partnership with Volkswagen.

Tesla wasn't the only automaker to experience a sales drop in 2025 as electric-vehicle tax credits in the United States came to an end. Rivian has released its sales data for the full year, and while the result is in line with its expectations, it's not a pretty picture.

Rivian on Friday confirmed 42,247 vehicle deliveries in 2025, an 18% decrease from 2024's record high of 51,579. In particular, Rivian saw a sharp drop in fourth-quarter deliveries—the electric startup moved 9,745 units in the last three months of 2025, compared to 13,201 in the third quarter.

In other words, a lot of buyers rushed out to secure a Rivian R1S or R1T before the tax credit ended in late September, and then didn't show up for the rest of the year.

Unlike Tesla and other automakers, Rivian only sells its EVs in the U.S. and Canada. But the end of America's $7,500 EV tax credit—which also applied to any leased EV—hit most carmakers hard. The credit was a strong driver of both sales and leases, and so many companies, analysts and experts predicted a drop in EV adoption in the latter part of 2025. That includes Rivian, which said that the company's annual deliveries were in line with its estimates.

Tesla, which operates much more globally than Rivian, announced a 9% sales drop in 2025. Chinese automaker BYD is now the worldwide leader in EV sales.

However, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has said that in the long run, the end of the tax credit could be advantageous if it forces competitors to back off their EV investments. “Narrowly and myopically through the lens of Rvian, it actually creates less competition,"" Scaringe said in November.

The ultimate test of that theory comes later this year with the debut of the 2026 Rivian R2. That EV, a downsized SUV that rides on an all-new platform, will be more affordable and more profitable than its current R1 models. Those SUVs and trucks usually retail for between $80,000 and $100,000 or more. Rivian has claimed the R2 will start around $45,000, although the ""launch edition"" vehicles are likely to be more expensive.

Even so, the R2 is expected to be a crucial, long-term volume-selling EV for Rivian, much as the Model Y was for Tesla. Scaringe told the InsideEVs Plugged-In Podcast as much last year. “If you want to buy an electric vehicle for under $50,000 today, I would say in the United States there are well under five great choices,” Scaringe said. The R2, he said, needs to be a promising enough product that can appeal beyond tax incentives.

Meanwhile, Rivian has a few other promising irons in the fire. The startup was given the keys to the Volkswagen Group's future electrical architecture and software plans in the West, a $6 billion joint-venture deal. And the company is working to boost its autonomous vehicle technology. In December, Rivian announced that a future R2 variant will include lidar for eventual self-driving, and that the company is becoming a kind of Nvidia competitor by making its own computer chips in-house.

Rivian has said that R2 deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of 2026. Until then, the R1S and R1T will have to hold down the fort.

In a seismic shift for the global automotive industry, China’s BYD has officially overtaken Tesla as the world’s leading seller of electric vehicles, marking a pivotal moment in the race for dominance in sustainable transportation. Recent data reveals that BYD delivered 2.26 million battery-electric vehicles in 2025, surpassing Tesla’s 1.64 million units, according to reports from multiple outlets. This achievement comes amid intensifying competition and policy changes that have reshaped market dynamics, particularly in China, the world’s largest auto market.

The numbers underscore BYD’s rapid ascent. While Tesla has long been synonymous with electric innovation, BYD’s strategy of offering affordable, high-volume models has propelled it to the forefront. For instance, BYD’s total vehicle sales, including hybrids, reached 4.6 million units last year, meeting its revised targets despite a challenging economic environment in China. Tesla, on the other hand, faced headwinds from the expiration of federal tax credits in the U.S. and increased rivalry from European manufacturers.

This turnover isn’t just about sales figures; it reflects broader trends in technology, supply chains, and consumer preferences. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, once famously laughed off BYD’s prospects in a 2011 interview, but the Chinese company’s focus on vertical integration—controlling everything from battery production to vehicle assembly—has given it a cost advantage that’s hard to ignore.

The Roots of BYD’s Rise

BYD’s journey from a battery maker to an automotive powerhouse began in the mid-2000s, but its EV ambitions took off with heavy investments in research and development. Founded in 1995, the company initially specialized in rechargeable batteries before entering the auto sector in 2003. By leveraging China’s vast resources in rare earth minerals and a government-backed push for green energy, BYD has built an ecosystem that minimizes dependencies on foreign suppliers.

Contrast this with Tesla, which revolutionized the industry with its premium models like the Model 3 and Cybertruck, emphasizing software and autonomous driving features. However, Tesla’s growth has slowed, with quarterly deliveries falling short of expectations in late 2025, as noted in a Reuters analysis. The elimination of U.S. federal incentives under the Trump administration exacerbated this, hitting Tesla harder than rivals with diversified markets.

BYD’s success is also tied to its pricing strategy. Models like the Seagull, priced under $10,000 in China, have democratized EV ownership, appealing to budget-conscious buyers in emerging markets. This approach has allowed BYD to capture a 15% share of all car sales in China, far outpacing Tesla’s presence there.

Policy Shifts and Market Pressures

Government policies have played a crucial role in this narrative. In China, subsidies and mandates for electric vehicles have fueled domestic growth, enabling companies like BYD to scale rapidly. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the withdrawal of EV tax credits has dampened demand, as highlighted in coverage from The New York Times. This policy divergence has widened the gap, with Chinese firms benefiting from a supportive regulatory environment.

Globally, BYD’s export strategy is gaining traction. Sales outside China surged 151% in 2025, with the UK emerging as a key market. Posts on X reflect growing sentiment that BYD’s affordable offerings are winning over European consumers, challenging established players. Tesla, focused on high-margin vehicles and ventures like robotaxis, has seen its core auto business questioned amid these developments.

Competition from Europe adds another layer. Brands like Volkswagen and BMW are ramping up EV production, eroding Tesla’s market share. A Euronews report details how BYD’s lower prices are reshaping the competitive field, forcing Western automakers to rethink strategies.

Technological Edge and Supply Chain Mastery

At the heart of BYD’s dominance is its battery technology. The company’s Blade Battery, known for safety and efficiency, has set new standards, reducing costs by up to 30% compared to competitors. This innovation stems from BYD’s origins as a battery producer, allowing it to integrate vertically and avoid supply bottlenecks that plagued Tesla during chip shortages.

Tesla’s strengths lie in its software ecosystem, including over-the-air updates and Full Self-Driving capabilities, but these haven’t translated to volume sales in price-sensitive markets. As per a Bloomberg article, BYD’s 2025 sales milestone was overshadowed by concerns about China’s auto market slowdown, yet it still outpaced Tesla in pure EV deliveries.

Industry insiders point to BYD’s diversification into hybrids as a smart hedge. While Tesla remains all-in on battery electrics, BYD’s plug-in hybrids accounted for a significant portion of its 4.6 million units, bridging the gap for consumers wary of full electrification.

Global Expansion and Challenges Ahead

BYD’s ambitions extend beyond China. The company is building factories in Thailand, Brazil, and Hungary, aiming to localize production and evade tariffs. This move counters protectionist measures, such as potential U.S. barriers under Trump, which could limit Chinese EV imports. Sentiment on X highlights how BYD’s revenue surpassing Tesla’s—reaching $108 billion in 2024—signals a broader economic shift.

Tesla, steering toward robotaxis and humanoid robots, as Musk pivots the company, faces questions about its auto fundamentals. A WIRED piece notes that Tesla’s sales drop in 2025 ceded the crown to BYD, with full-year figures confirming the change.

However, challenges loom for BYD. Overcapacity in China’s auto sector could lead to price wars, squeezing margins. Geopolitical tensions, including trade disputes, might hinder exports. Analysts warn that while BYD leads in volume, Tesla’s higher average selling prices mean its revenue per vehicle remains superior—estimated at twice that of BYD’s.

Strategic Responses and Industry Implications

In response, Tesla is accelerating efforts in autonomous technology, betting on software as a differentiator. Musk’s involvement in U.S. politics, including ties to the Trump administration, could influence future policies favoring domestic production. Yet, as detailed in a Guardian report, Tesla’s sales slump post-subsidy cuts underscores vulnerabilities.

For BYD, sustaining growth involves innovation in smart features and expanding premium lines to compete with Tesla’s luxury appeal. Partnerships, like potential collaborations with tech giants, could enhance its global footprint.

The broader industry feels the ripple effects. Traditional automakers are accelerating EV transitions, with Ford and GM investing billions to catch up. Posts on X capture public fascination, from mockery of Musk’s past dismissals to admiration for BYD’s efficiency.

Future Trajectories in Electric Mobility

Looking ahead, the EV market’s evolution will hinge on battery advancements and charging infrastructure. BYD’s investments in solid-state batteries could further solidify its lead, potentially reducing costs and extending range.

Tesla’s Cybercab and Optimus projects represent a diversification away from pure vehicle sales, positioning it as a tech company. However, as a BBC article states, this is the first time BYD has outpaced Tesla annually, a milestone in the Sino-American rivalry.

Emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America offer growth avenues for BYD, where affordability trumps premium features. Conversely, Tesla’s brand strength in North America and Europe provides a buffer.

Economic and Geopolitical Dimensions

This shift has economic ramifications. China’s dominance in EV supply chains strengthens its position in global trade, potentially influencing commodity prices for lithium and cobalt.

Geopolitically, it heightens U.S.-China tensions, with calls for tariffs to protect domestic industries. A CNBC report recounts Musk’s early skepticism, now ironic given BYD’s triumph.

Investors are recalibrating. Tesla’s stock has faced volatility, while BYD’s shares reflect confidence in its model.

Innovation and Consumer Shifts

Consumer preferences are evolving, with sustainability and cost driving choices. BYD’s focus on practical, efficient vehicles resonates in densely populated regions.

Tesla continues to innovate in AI-driven features, potentially regaining ground through ecosystem lock-in.

Ultimately, this dethroning signals a multipolar EV world, where no single player dominates indefinitely. As per insights from Electrek, BYD’s 2025 performance secures its crown, but the race accelerates.

Sustaining Momentum Amid Uncertainties

BYD must navigate domestic slowdowns, with forecasts predicting moderated growth in 2026. Expanding service networks globally will be key.

For Tesla, refocusing on core autos while advancing tech ventures could restore balance.

Amid what's expected to be a slower year for electric vehicles in America, Toyota will debut two new battery-powered models.

Perhaps the most promising is the 2026 Toyota C-HR, a kind of shrunken-down Toyota bZ—complete with a smaller price tag.

In Europe, at least, the C-HR could use more affordable LFP batteries, too.

With electric-vehicle tax credits gone, fuel economy regulations relaxed and car companies feeling the tariff heat, 2026 is expected to be a slower year for EV adoption. But there are still some bright spots ahead, especially as the EV field moves in a more affordable direction. And one of the more promising entries will come from a company that's historically been more reluctant to lean into EVs than others.

Slated for debut this year is the 2026 Toyota C-HR: a new, smaller and more affordable member of the Toyota EV family that kicked off with the original bZ4X.

That car has been renamed the Toyota bZ for 2026, and it benefits from a wide range of improvements to range, charging, performance and software. But the bigger news is that it's bringing this new friend to play as well.

The C-HR—called the C-HR+ in other markets, to differentiate its all-electric version from other ones—on the same e-TNGA platform as the bZ. But in some ways, it's actually better, in terms of specs. It comes standard with dual-motor all-wheel-drive, eschewing the bZ's front-drive version. That means it packs the same 74.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack in a smaller overall package; it's four inches shorter in wheelbase, two inches shorter and about six inches shorter in total length.

That smaller size means it should deliver an estimated 290 miles of range, Toyota has said. (Official EPA-rated estimates are forthcoming.) That's right around the current table-stakes standard of 300 miles for modern EVs, and in ideal conditions, the C-HR could potentially deliver even more than that. And with 338 horsepower delivering an estimated five-second 0-60 mph time, it should be a decent performer as well.

Like the bZ and the other members of the updated Toyota EV family, the C-HR will also use a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) port. While Toyota's EVs can already use more than 20,000 Tesla Superchargers with an adapter, the NACS port will make that more seamless than ever.

On the downside, the C-HR will sacrifice interior room to the bZ. It delivers about three cubic feet less storage space behind the second row of seats and dimensions are tighter overall.

While America's C-HR will be fairly well-appointed, the EV comes in more budget-minded trims in other markets. Our colleagues at InsideEVs Germany report that the European C-HR+ will include two front-wheel drive options, and more importantly, what appear to be lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Those should be a 57.7-kWh LFP battery and a larger 77.0-kWh unit. Toyota has already stated it's working on longer-range LFP batteries for 2026 and beyond, but these seem to be different units.

Regardless, America's C-HR could be a great addition to the field in America for buyers who have been waiting for Toyota to get serious about EVs. Pricing is expected to start well below $40,000—possibly even below $35,000, considering that's now the starting MSRP for the larger bZ.

Toyota has confirmed that the C-HR will arrive later this year at American dealerships, along with the larger bZ Woodland and several Subaru-badged counterparts. We at InsideEVs expect to get behind the wheel for a first-drive test very soon.

Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, initially offered a veiled response to the second stop work order.
But the hundreds of pages filed in D.C. federal court in the first two days of the year reveal a more forceful fight.
“Rhode Island has built national leadership in offshore wind by doing the hard work and delivering real results,” Gov.
The AGs case was originally filed in Rhode Island federal court, but transferred to D.C. in December, less than two weeks before the second stop work order.","The year is new, but the argument is the same: The Trump administration has no constitutional authority to halt work on a major offshore wind project nearing completion south of Rhode Island’s coastline.

Hundreds of pages of legal filings submitted in federal court on Jan. 1 and 2 by the Revolution Wind developers reprise many of the same arguments already invoked in its August lawsuit against federal regulators.

The 65-turbine project was already 80% complete when the Trump administration unexpectedly ordered work to stop on Aug. 22, citing national security issues. A month of anguish ensued, with local officials, labor leaders and environmental advocates, along with the companies behind the $5 billion project, decrying the unconstitutional overstep by federal regulators. A federal judge in D.C. stepped in, forcing the Trump administration to back off in a Sept. 22 order. Unlike other litigation between states and companies and the federal government, the order was never appealed.

The rocky seas seemed to calm. Laborers resumed work, and the developers said they were still on schedule to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut by mid-2026. Offshore installation was scheduled to be completed in mid-February, according to an affidavit from Paul Murphy, senior engineering procurement and construction director for the project.

Then, three days before Christmas, a new edict from the Trump administration ordered work to stop again on Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects along the Atlantic coast. The second, 90-day pause again rested on national security concerns, despite the rigorous review already dubbed complete by the same federal energy agencies years before.

Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, initially offered a veiled response to the second stop work order. But the hundreds of pages filed in D.C. federal court in the first two days of the year reveal a more forceful fight.

“The Second Stop Work Order is arbitrary and capricious: It is wholly conclusory, internally inconsistent, and overbroad,” states one of the new legal filings, submitted on Jan. 1. “The Second Stop Work Order ignores that the [Department of] Interior has stated plainly that the Project does not interfere with national security. It also ignores Revolution Wind’s obvious and substantial actions and billions of dollars of investment made in reliance.”

Since work resumed in mid-September, developers have finished installing the foundations that anchor the turbines to the sea floor, along with 58 of the 65 turbines, and “substantial completion” of the underwater cables that will connect the wind-powered electricity to the regional grid, according to court filings. Developers now estimate the project is 87% completed — up from 80% in mid-August.

With every day the pause continues, the losses pile up. The companies estimate they are losing $1.44 million a day on already inked contracts with specialty vessels meant to carry heavy equipment and workers out to sea. If the pause is not lifted by Jan. 12, there is a “very high risk” the vessels will no longer be available and the remaining turbines will not be installed by the mandated Jan. 15, 2027 deadline to supply power to Rhode Island, the court filings state.

The development companies are seeking a second preliminary injunction to stop the Trump administration from suspending work on the project, and have also asked to speed up the deliberations.

Royce C. Lamberth, senior judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, agreed to the second request. His Jan. 2 order gives the Department of Justice attorneys representing the federal administration until Thursday, Jan. 8, to submit a response. An in-person hearing in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 12, according to the court docket.

What’s at stake in R.I.

Beyond the $6 billion loss projected by project developers if the project is canceled or left incomplete are the consequences for Rhode Island and Connecticut. On Friday, state and congressional leaders, labor organizers and environmental advocates organized a press conference and rally in downtown Providence to demonstrate their support for the project.

“Rhode Island has built national leadership in offshore wind by doing the hard work and delivering real results,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement following the event. “These projects are essential to keeping energy affordable, creating long-term jobs, strengthening our economy, and meeting our climate goals. We remain committed to an energy future that works for Rhode Island’s workers, families, and businesses.”

More than 2,000 workers, many of them union laborers, have staked their careers on the burgeoning offshore wind industry, aided by specialty training programs including at the Community College of Rhode Island. Since the second stop work order was issued, 200 workers were put on standby for off- and onshore work, according to an affidavit from Melanie Gearon, head of permitting for the project.

“Just days before the holidays, this administration chose to put thousands of skilled construction workers in limbo – again,” said Michael F. Sabitoni, general secretary-treasurer of the local chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America and president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council. “These are men and women who were counting on this work to support their families and keep food on the table. Offshore wind means union jobs, strong wages, and real economic security. Pulling the plug at the end of the year is reckless and deeply unfair to working families.”

The Ocean State’s ambitious decarbonization mandate, reaching net-zero by 2050, also hinges upon the project’s completion and power for up to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. Even states without direct contracts to buy power from the project stand to benefit from a regional electric grid better shielded from the seasonal fluctuations in natural gas prices and availability.

“Stopping these projects ignores both climate science and public support for these projects, and it delays the clean energy transition our communities are counting on,” said Jeff Migneault, executive director of Climate Action Rhode Island.

The press conference and rally also featured remarks from U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo.

The states’ stakes in the project were the focus of a second federal lawsuit filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general in August. The AGs case was originally filed in Rhode Island federal court, but transferred to D.C. in December, less than two weeks before the second stop work order. No new submissions have been filed in the AGs court case since the latest move by the Trump administration to halt the project, though Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said previously that his office was reviewing the suspension order.

A second Orsted project, Sunrise Wind, under construction off the coast of Long Island, New York, was also subject to the December stop work order. Orsted said in a statement on Jan. 1 that it is still evaluating options for this project, including possible legal proceedings.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/607435144_122233792580119380_6578483255360854123_n.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 14:12:48.295881

""If solid state batteries technology comes online with proven, tested results, [this] would be a game changer for EVs!""","A new partnership in battery manufacturing could help push electric vehicles closer to a long-promised breakthrough — and make EVs more practical, affordable, and appealing for everyday drivers.

Electrek reported that U.S.-based Factorial Energy and South Korea's POSCO announced a collaboration at the Future Battery Forum in Berlin aimed at accelerating the development of all-solid-state batteries, a next-generation technology often described as the ""holy grail"" of EV power.

Unlike today's lithium-ion batteries, which rely on liquid electrolytes, solid-state batteries use solid materials that can store more energy, charge faster, and reduce fire risk.

The biggest challenge holding solid-state batteries back has been materials. Researchers have struggled to find solid electrolytes that conduct electricity efficiently without cracking under stress.

Under the new agreement, Factorial and POSCO will combine their expertise to develop and scale those critical materials, including lithium-metal anodes and sulfide-based solid electrolytes.

""Solid-state batteries are entering a new era of commercial readiness,"" Factorial CEO Siyu Huang said, per Electrek, noting that the partnership could also help drive down costs at scale — a key hurdle for widespread adoption.

Solid-state batteries could deliver driving ranges over 600 miles, faster charging times, and longer battery lifespans.

Factorial has already demonstrated the tech outside the lab: Mercedes-Benz tested a solid-state-powered EQS that drove 750 miles from Stuttgart to Malmö and still had range left.

As the publication noted, Mercedes' tech chief Markus Schäfer called the batteries ""a true gamechanger for electric mobility,"" emphasizing that they now perform ""not only in the lab but also on the road.""

For drivers, this technology could mean fewer charging stops, lower long-term maintenance costs, and safer vehicles. On a broader scale, better batteries help speed the shift away from gas-powered cars, cutting tailpipe pollution that harms air quality and human health.

Pairing an EV with home solar can compound those benefits by reducing or even eliminating charging costs. Tools like TCD's Solar Explorer can help homeowners see how installing solar panels might lower energy bills while making clean transportation even more affordable.

Many commenters were excited about the announcement.

""If solid state batteries technology comes online with proven, tested results, [this] would be a game changer for EVs!"" one wrote.

Another added: ""The article just scratches the surface of the battery tech and potential applications; by pushing for greater energy density, the packs could be much smaller/lighter (and more affordable) for a 300-mile range EV, or scaled up for tractor trailer loads.

Yet there were also developments to celebrate, including record deployment of battery storage systems, historic power generation shares from solar farms in dozens of countries, and continued growth in electric vehicle sales in key car markets. Below are some of the key milestones and developments impacting global energy transition progress in 2025, as well as key data points to track heading into 2026 and beyond.

China’s growing clean clout

China remains at the forefront of clean energy generation, and deploys more nuclear, solar, wind and bioenergy power than any other nation. Clean electricity production is on track to record its seventh consecutive year of strong growth. Over the first 11 months of 2025, total clean power output rose 15.4 percent from a year earlier, Ember data shows.

Clean power sources will generate more than 40 percent of China’s utility-supplied electricity for the first time in 2025, while fossil fuels’ share will drop to a record low.

Fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of China’s power system, but since 2019 clean power output has grown more than four times faster than fossil-fuel generation. With Beijing set to keep expanding its solar, wind, nuclear and battery power capacity over the coming decade or so, clean power’s share in China’s generation mix is likely to keep climbing.

China is also making its mark overseas via record clean-technology exports, which climbed to more than $180 billion over the first 10 months of 2025, according to customs data compiled by Ember.

Battery storage systems have emerged as China’s most lucrative clean-tech export, with nearly $66 billion in sales, followed by around $54 billion in EV exports. Exports of grid equipment and heating and cooling units have also hit record highs in 2025, cementing China’s role as the dominant supplier of hardware for the world’s electrification push.

US setback

In contrast to China’s momentum, US clean energy progress hit reverse in 2025 after federal support for renewables was scrapped under the second administration of US President Donald Trump. Steep cuts to tax credits for power developers are expected to slash clean energy investments in coming years and leave the US power system heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Natural gas remains the main source for US electricity, but in 2025, coal-fired plants delivered the biggest jump in output, driven largely by a spike in gas prices that squeezed utility margins. Coal-fired electricity output from January to November increased 13 percent from a year earlier, its highest in three years, according to Ember.

Because coal plants emit far more carbon dioxide than gas plants - over 900,000 metric tons of CO2 per terawatt hour versus about 550,000 tons for gas - US power-sector emissions also climbed in 2025.

Total emissions from coal and gas plants reached 1.526 billion metric tons of CO2 from January to November, up 3 percent from the same period in 2024 and the highest since 2021, Ember data shows. Given that US natural gas prices look set to finish 2025 at roughly 50 percent above their 2024 average, utilities are likely to lean further on cheaper coal to meet winter demand. That means even higher power-sector pollution heading into 2026 and beyond.

Battery boom and stealthy progress

Even as US utilities burned more coal in 2025, they also rolled out record battery storage capacity to capture surplus solar and wind power for later use. Total US installed battery storage capacity surpassed 39 gigawatts in 2025, a 43 percent increase from 2024, according to energy data portal Cleanview.

That surge is reshaping power flows in key electricity networks. Both California and Texas have added enough battery capacity to materially alter their power grid’s generation mix during peak demand. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state’s main grid and the country’s largest battery adopter, uses batteries to supply around 15 percent to 18 percent of electricity during the evening peak demand, according to Grid Status data, reducing the need for gas and other power sources. In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a more recent adopter of battery systems, around 3 percent of electricity during peak demand was supplied from battery storage systems - a modest share but up from near zero just a year ago.

Solar power systems have also made their mark again in 2025, generating record shares of utility electricity supplies in several countries.

China and the US typically dominate discussions about solar capacity, but solar’s widespread penetration in recent years now means that developed and emerging economies alike deploy the technology at scale. At times in 2025, countries such as Bulgaria, Pakistan, Hungary and Poland sourced around 20 percent or more of their electricity from solar farms, cutting both costs and emissions.

In 2026, solar’s generation share will likely set new records in even more countries, helping to keep global energy transition momentum alive even if some major economies, such as the US, step back. — Reuters",https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2026/01/04/342745.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 13:12:47.501777

Carolina Journal

As 2025 comes to a close, North Carolina stands in an enviable position. After more than a decade of disciplined tax reform, the Tar Heel State has emerged as one of America’s most economically competitive states. CNBC’s America’s Top States for Business rankings once again place North Carolina among the nation’s leaders, confirming what employers and investors already know: North Carolina is a premier place to invest, expand and create jobs.

That reputation is reinforced by the Tax Foundation’s 2026 State Tax Competitiveness Index, which ranks North Carolina 13th overall — up from 44th as recently as 2013 — ahead of most states that levy all the major taxes and near the top nationally on corporate taxation. This strong showing is no accident. It reflects a flat 4.25 percent individual income tax, the lowest corporate income tax rate among states that still levy one at 2.25 percent, and a sustained commitment to broad tax bases and low rates rather than politically favored credits.

Yet even the Tax Foundation is clear: North Carolina’s biggest remaining obstacle to greater competitiveness is its franchise tax.

What makes the franchise tax different — and harmful

Unlike income-based taxes, the franchise tax is levied on a business’s net worth — its accumulated capital — regardless of whether the business is profitable. Companies pay it year after year simply for owning assets, even in downturns or startup phases. In effect, the tax penalizes investment itself, taxing firms not on what they earn but on what they have built.

The Tax Foundation’s North Carolina profile does not mince words. It calls the franchise tax “unusually aggressive,” noting that it taxes businesses “on their worth rather than their profits,” harming investment and violating basic principles of tax fairness and ability to pay. In a state otherwise defined by pro-growth tax policy, the franchise tax stands out as an anachronism.

Real costs for real businesses

This problem is not theoretical. A 2024 John Locke Foundation report shows that the franchise tax creates especially high compliance costs due to its complexity and traps small businesses and independent contractors in mandatory minimum payments. The burden falls especially hard on mom-and-pop businesses, such as a local plumbing company with fewer than 20 employees that owns a small fleet of work vans. Even in a slow year, that firm owes the franchise tax simply for having invested in the vehicles and equipment it needs to operate — penalizing small businesses not for profits, but for preparedness. The same analysis shows that the tax exposes companies to punitive audits over technical errors rather than real tax avoidance, and that businesses can owe the tax even if they lose money — or even if they have no physical presence in North Carolina, so long as they sell goods here.

And for all that damage, the franchise tax contributes little to state finances. In recent years, it has accounted for just over 2 percent of General Fund revenue, a share that is shrinking further due to recently enacted caps. That is a steep economic price to pay for such a modest and declining return.

That reality leads to the most common objection to repeal — and the least persuasive.

The revenue objection — and why it falls short

Critics will argue that repeal is impractical because the franchise tax still generates revenue. But that objection misunderstands both scale and trade-offs. The amount involved is small enough to absorb through normal economic growth, ongoing budget surpluses or modest base broadening elsewhere. More importantly, repealing the franchise tax would remove a direct penalty on capital investment, encouraging business expansion that broadens the income and sales tax bases over time. In other words, repeal is not a gamble on growth — it is an exchange of a narrow, distortionary tax for a broader, more sustainable revenue stream.

Other states have recognized this reality. Oklahoma repealed its capital stock tax. Mississippi is phasing its out. Connecticut is completing its repeal. Louisiana has already enacted repeal as part of a broader competitiveness package — and the Tax Foundation expects that move alone to produce meaningful improvements in Louisiana’s rankings and investment climate. Meanwhile, North Carolina risks being left behind, clinging to a tax most states have already abandoned.

What makes this moment especially important is that North Carolina has already done the hard work. The state has resisted the temptation to rely on narrow tax credits and instead built a system based on low rates and neutrality. That approach is precisely why North Carolina ranks so highly among states that levy all major taxes. Eliminating the franchise tax would not be a radical departure — it would be the logical completion of a long-running reform agenda.

A clear next step for 2026

If lawmakers want a single, concrete goal for strengthening North Carolina’s economy in 2026, this is it. Repeal the franchise tax. Remove the last major tax penalty on capital formation. Signal to entrepreneurs, manufacturers and employers that North Carolina will not tax them for growing, investing or weathering hard times.

North Carolina has become a national model by refusing to settle for “good enough.” Ending the franchise tax would ensure it remains one.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Salisbury-Post.png,N,,2026-01-04 15:58:24.127486

With so much misinformation circulating about the economics of energy, one climate expert is cutting through the noise with the facts.

Former U.S. climate negotiator Lia Newman (@liaandtheworld) recently posted a TikTok debunking the claim that increasing fossil fuel usage boosts a region's GDP, in turn providing economic stability and lower poverty rates.

This claim was recently amplified in a video from The Free Press and former climate activist Lucy Biggers, which featured graphs suggesting a link between dirty energy use and increased income.

Debunking these graphs, Newman explained that they were created by fossil fuel advocate Alex Epstein, showing a clear agenda behind their framing. Addressing these claims, Newman cited a well-known scientific adage: ""Correlation is not causation.""

""This 'fossil [fuels] equals development' myth is outdated and misleading,"" Newman wrote in a caption to her video.

Newman clarified that fossil fuels themselves aren't pulling people out of poverty, despite what the graphs imply. Instead, it's what dirty energy usage represents — industrial, manufacturing, and job growth.

But that relationship is changing. Clean energy is reshaping manufacturing and industrial sectors, proving that countries can build booming economies without relying on high-pollution pathways.

Newman pointed to the rapid expansion of the clean energy sector in China and India as evidence that renewables can drive economic growth just as effectively as dirty energy sources. ​​She added that while total emissions are still rising in many countries, emissions intensity — the amount of pollution produced per unit of GDP — has been steadily falling, meaning economies are generating more value with less pollution than before.

""This shows a decoupling that, although GDP can rise, emissions or emission intensity can drop,"" Newman said.

That trend is already happening in several countries. As Newman outlined, GDP is continuing to rise while dirty energy emissions drop in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. There is also already divergence in GDP and dirty energy emissions in China, India, Africa, and Latin America. Newman said this divergence shows that economic growth no longer has to be tied to rising pollution.

""This video presents a false choice — development or tackling emissions — which is just not true,"" Newman said, referencing the video by The Free Press. ""Don't be fooled by these points promoted by the fossil fuel industry.""

In an era when misinformation spreads quickly, many of Newman's viewers said they appreciated seeing the claims fact-checked in real time.

By Gordon Anderson | gordon@rantnc.com

If you’re new to Lee County, fracking might not be a term you’ve heard a whole lot of in the context of local politics. But there was a time not long ago when fracking — shorthand for hydraulic fracturing, a method used to release natural gas and other resources by injecting high-pressure fluid into underground rock formations — was a hot topic both across the state and in the general area.

Lee and Chatham counties sit atop shale gas deposits identified by state geologists, and for much of the early 2010s, there was a contingent both locally and in the state capitol working to allow those with mineral rights in the area to get to it. Proponents said it would create new wealth, new economic activity and a clean burning energy source right here at home.

Detractors, however, pointed to reports of environmental harm in places like Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, where fracking has been undertaken on a large scale. There were widely circulated reports at the time of contaminated water — including claims of flammable tap water. Even earthquakes have been tentatively linked to fracking. Also, mineral rights are often severed from land rights, meaning one can theoretically have the right to access natural gas that’s beneath land that isn’t theirs.

There’s not enough space to rehash that debate in its entirety, but it had gone mostly quiet by the turn of the 2020s. Lee County was under a locally-passed fracking moratorium through the last half of the 2010s, but even after it expired, there’s been no commercial hydraulic fracturing here or elsewhere in North Carolina outside of test and exploratory wells.

But the debate about fracking, it seems, wasn’t over. Just dormant.

Deep River Data and the Butler Well

Things came spilling back into the public on Nov. 1, when Inside Climate News published a report indicating Alamance County-based company Deep River Data wanted to access natural gas from Butler Well No. 3, which is situated in the woods between U.S. 421 and Cumnock Road near the Lee-Chatham County line and use it to power a data center for artificial intelligence here.

The story identified Deep River Data as having “connections with the cryptocurrency industry” and detailed connections its officers have both in business and government.

“Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur,” the story read. “He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power ‘AI workloads,’ not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.”

The ICN piece reports Spuller writing “we want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression — avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible.”

The news spread quickly – the article and others like it were shared on social media, often with calls to action attached. In December, that action spilled off of the internet and into real life. At meetings of the Sanford City Council (Dec. 2) and the Lee County Board of Commissioners (Dec. 15) nearly 20 people addressed the two boards, urging both to put a stop to the idea as quickly as possible.

Although Spuller is quoted in the Inside Climate News piece as saying Deep River Data plans to use “conventional drilling, rather than fracking,” those who appeared before local governing boards in December unanimously asked for moratoriums to be enacted on both data centers and fracking.

Community concerns

“Sanford has a large population of residents that would be harmed by fracking,” area resident Keely Puricz told the city council on Dec. 2, holding up a map of the area surrounding Butler Well No. 3. “I’m speaking before it’s too late. The risk of using an antiquated well in itself is frightening. This well has not had regular inspections … and at recent meetings of the Oil & Gas Commission, the (Department of Environmental Quality) admitted they only had one employee to review the rules versus the four or five they had 10 years ago.”

Sam Kauffman told the council he’s originally from Oklahoma, and “grew up during the oil and gas boom.”

“I’ve seen the wells, I’ve seen the fracking — it’s not worth it,” he said. “You’ll end up in an Erin Brokovich situation where pollution is inevitable.

“It’s not if, it’s when.”

The county Board of Commissioners heard more of the same less than two weeks later.

“I know this will be a great monetary gain for the man that’s interested in having this in our county,” Christine Morgan told the commissioners on Dec. 15. “But we all deserve to have clean air and clean water. I feel like that’s our right. God made the planet one way, and we have done enough in our destructive selves.”

Jennifer Garner told the commissioners she was born and raised in Sanford, and had “moved away a couple times.”

“Every time I came back I’d see the growth and the revitalization that’s been done in my favorite city and my favorite downtown,” she said. “It seems like a gross, counterproductive measure to put all that into our community just to destroy it, just to open the literal floodgates of contamination that would be brought by frackinig.”

The message was clear: There’s at least a part of the Lee County community that’s not only adamantly opposed to fracking, but also data centers in general, and they’re not afraid to show up and talk about it.

Permits, utilities and regulatory reality

There’s a wrinkle to the concern over drilling for AI in Lee County. Not a single permit has been requested for any of the things outlined in the Nov. 1 story — not at the state level or the local level.

Not to cast doubt on the ICN piece, which is sourced from emails received under a request for public information. There’s no reason to doubt those are real or that Deep River Data has at least explored the idea it described. But potential moratoriums aside, there’s nothing for local government to do right now with regards to the rumored project, because nobody’s asked for anything. At least not on paper, according to Kirk Smith, Republican chairman for the Lee County Board of Commissioners.

“There are no permit requests before the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to access the natural gas in Lee County nor the Butler #3 gas well,” Smith told The Rant via email in December. “There are no permit requests for a drill pad nor for an access road with the NC DOT. There are no permit requests for extraction and the ultimate closing of the well. The Lee County Technical Review Committee has not received any plans for a proposed data center nor has the Sanford Area Growth Alliance received any Requests for Information with the intent of establishing a data center. The Lee County Joint Planning Commission gave instructions for the staff to research possible modifications to the Unified Development Ordinance addressing data centers.”

Further, utilities are increasingly wary of data centers — they use an inordinate amount of power after all, and companies like Duke Energy are more regularly asking for sizable, up front monetary commitments from those who want to operate one. It’s possible the rumored project would be powered by a private, onsite power plant of its own, but that would still require approval from Duke for interconnection and backup service. So, nowhere near impossible, but not as simple as it sounds either.

Smith’s statement could be seen as cold water thrown on the idea of drilling for natural gas at Butler No. 3 and using it to power a data center. But Smith also threw cold water on the idea of any kind of moratorium on fracking and/or data centers.

“The demand to establish a moratorium thus blocking land owners from generating wealth from their property, is on its face dictatorial and rooted in an authoritarian regime most associated with Marxists,” he wrote. “While on the subject, recent hearings in the U.S. Congress reveal the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is funding environmental groups opposing ‘data centers.’

“The CCP is home to cheap and plentiful electricity generated by coal fired electrical plants (do you recall the air pollution leading up to the Beijing Olympics?). What better way for China to lead and dominate the Artificial Intelligence industry. Our Constitutional purpose as a governing body is to ‘Protect Life, Liberty, and Property Rights.’ Any moratorium violates that fundamental purpose of our Constitutional Republic protecting property rights.”

However, local fracking moratoriums in North Carolina aren’t explicitly bans on the practices — they’re temporary pauses that allow governments to review potential impacts. The state retains ultimate regulatory authority.

Data centers: A separate but linked debate

Jimmy Randolph, CEO of the Sanford Area Growth Alliance — a public-private partnership that houses the area chamber of commerce as well as the county’s economic development operation — similarly said he hasn’t heard much, if any, credible talk about the project. He was careful to distinguish the issues opponents are raising from one another.

“There’s a conversation to be had about data centers and the benefits and utility they may be able to provide to communities like ours. The right data center project could absolutely be a positive for Sanford and Lee County. Fracking is an entirely separate conversation with concerns and questions that are unique to that issue,” he said. “That being said, SAGA has not received or been asked to provide any information about the specific project referenced in recent media reports and in front of the city council and the county commissioners, so it would be inappropriate to speculate.”

The debate over data centers includes controversies of its own — controversies which are separate from the debate over fracking. They’ve been shown to bring increased tax revenue and some number of jobs, although nowhere near the number a more traditional industry might offer. But there have also been concerns about water usage and other environmental concerns (for his part, Smith disputed entirely the idea that data centers “consume enormous amounts of water,” calling the idea “fear mongering”).

So it’s not surprising that news reports are common lately which describe local governments proposing and enacting standards surrounding data centers.

A recent piece in the Midland Daily News in Texas described efforts by the government of Bay City, Texas (population of around 18,000) to look at concerns like “maximum facility size and acreage of the site; power demand threshold and utility capacity review, water usage limits and cooling method requirements; noise, lighting, buffering and setback standards; site location criteria and zoning compatibility; phased development and expansion limitations; emergency response, resiliency and decommissioning plans; and community benefit and infrastructure impact considerations.”

North Carolina law does allow local governments to regulate land use through zoning and other methods, making standards similar to those being explored in Bay City theory possible.

What comes next?

It’s too early for alarm or worry about Lee County’s potential role in the country’s AI boom. There’s too much that nobody knows at this point. Data centers and fracking are separate issues, but both have sparked local debate about environmental impacts, utility use and community standards. Those addressing local governments over the matter have the right idea — they’re making their stance known now while the issue gathers on horizon, instead of waiting for it unpack its bags.

Puricz, who spoke before both the city on Dec. 2, told the Board of Commissioners on Dec. 15 about recent fracking activity in Pennsylvania and cited a data center moratorium in Wisconsin that allowed “local government to develop suitable ordinances regulating an industry’s activities.”

“Since Dec. 4, one (Pennsylvania fracking) company had 360,000 gallons of drilling fluid lost into the local coal pockets,” she said.

Another speaker before the county commissioners on Dec. 15 was Debbie Hall, who acknowledged that no applications have been filed. “You know and we all know that the wheels are turning,” she said. “Drilling, fracking and data centers are linked to many hazards. You are the people that can help us, and we’re asking you to do that.”

This issue isn’t likely to go away anytime soon, regardless of what happens with the rumored project that kicked off what appears to be a revival in local anti fracking activity. More is coming in the weeks, months and years ahead. The Lee County Board of Commissioners as of this writing is scheduled to meet on Jan. 5, which is The Rant Monthly’s publication date. Clean Water for NC, a state based water advocacy group, published a blog on Dec. 17 urging interested parties to attend and ask for a moratorium on fracking and data centers.",https://i0.wp.com/rantnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/datafarm3.jpg?fit=1200%2C879&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-04 15:58:33.998575

The Green Fee increases the Transient Accommodations Tax by 0.75 percent to an 11 percent rate statewide. This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and short-term rentals. But on New Year’s Eve, a federal judge blocked one portion of the law from taking effect: specifically, the portion that would have introduced an 11 percent tax on cruise ship passenger bills.

That provision had faced pushback from the cruise industry earlier this year.

Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) sued the state in August, arguing the fee unfairly targets cruise passengers and will add hundreds of dollars to the price of Hawaii cruises. And in November, the U.S. Department of Justice also filed a motion in the Hawaii District Court asking a federal judge to let the federal government intervene in the cruise industry’s lawsuit against the Green Fee. The DOJ has argued that Hawaii doesn’t have the power the charge cruise ships this kind of fee, saying only Congress can approve taxes and charges on vessels when they enter a port.

A district judge denied CLIA’s request for an injunction in December, court documents show. But on Dec. 31, the Ninth Appellate Court granted an injunction after an appeal.

The CLIA applauded the decision in a statement shared with Nexstar.

“This case involves important questions about how federal and state laws interact in regulating maritime commerce — principles rooted in long-standing constitutional safeguards that protect free and open ports nationwide,” reads a statement from a CLIA spokesperson. “On behalf of its member cruise lines, CLIA will continue to pursue this matter constructively through the courts while working with Hawai‘i to support local communities and sustainable tourism.”

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green (D) and other lawmakers in support of the Green Fee had argued that the taxes were needed to mitigate environmental effects caused by tourism.

The revenue generated from the new Green Fee was projected to raise an estimated $100 million a year to address what the state says is about half a billion dollars in critical funding needed to protect Hawaii’s environment. The areas of priority are protecting land and aquatic resources, climate and hazard resiliency and sustainable tourism.

“We must protect and preserve Hawaiʻi’s natural resources and safeguard the health of our residents,” Green previously said. “Visitors who benefit from our island’s resources have a shared responsibility to help preserve them. The Green Fee ensures that the resources needed to protect Hawaiʻi are available for future generations.”

Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general’s office, believes it’s only a matter of time before the entire Green Fee is enforced.

“We are aware of the Ninth Circuit’s order granting an injunction that temporarily enjoins (halts) enforcement of Act 96 with respect to cruise ships while the appeals process moves forward,” Schwartz said in a statement shared with Nexstar’s KHON. “We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the expedited appeal is heard on the merits.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GettyImages-637168124-e1718985154555.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-04 12:12:28.472989

The energy industry will be abuzz with activity in South Carolina as two major developments unfold this year.

The most immediate is a proposal by Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy to construct a large natural-gas fired power plant in Colleton County that's roughly doubled in price since a 2023 cost estimate.

The utilities submitted their paperwork last month with the S.C. Public Service Commission, kicking off a six-month review process.

The first formal hearing for the $5 billion project is set for March 12 in Columbia — and opposition from environmental groups is expected.

Regulators must issue a decision by June 12.

Around the same time, Santee Cooper will have a clearer picture about whether its plan to sell the two unfinished reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant will advance.

The $2.7 billion deal was announced in October. Last month, the state-owned power provider signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" with global investment giant Brookfield Asset Management to continue negotiations and refine the terms of the sale that would likely close in 2027.

The agreement expires June 26, but it could be extended beyond that date. It also could be squelched if Brookfield decides to take a pass on the Midland reactors.

Check-in time

A long-awaited luxury hotel offering panoramic views of Charleston Harbor and the peninsula will soon make its debut in 2026 after years of delays.

The Cooper is scheduled to open on March 1.

The 191-room property next to Waterfront Park will offer a spa, four dining concepts, luxury retail shops, a private marina and other amenities.

The high-end Concord Street project has been on the drawing board since 2017. Los Angeles-based developer Lowe broke ground about six years ago at the site of the former State Ports Authority headquarters.

BHC, once known as Beemok Hospitality Collection and owned by Charleston business mogul Ben Navarro and his family, became the majority owner in 2021 and took about two years to put its stamp on the design plans.

Dockside dealings

The fate of a structurally unsound 1970s-era condominium tower along Charleston Harbor could be determined this year after the property’s governing board took a decisive move to line up a buyer.

Dockside Association Inc. closed out 2025 by seeking bankruptcy protection on Dec. 29. The filing keeps creditors at bay while putting all litigation on hold.

The end goal is to solicit as many would-be buyers as possible to bid on the 3.3-acre property at a court-supervised auction. It could be one of the most memorable local real estate transactions in recent memory.

""The board’s priority remains to secure the best possible outcome for all of Dockside’s 100+ owners, many of whom are already facing significant financial hardship, and we believe seeking this relief is the most expedient and effective path forward,” the association said in a written statement last month.

Residents were forced to evacuate the 18-story high-rise and adjacent ground-level townhomes in February. The owners later voted down a repair plan that would have cost them about $150 million.

Step it up

Two of the region's largest blue-chip manufacturers will be making moves to accelerate their assembly lines this year.

Boeing South Carolina is aiming to crank out 10 787 Dreamliners each month at its North Charleston factory by late 2026 to meet what it called ""exceptional demand"" for the widebody.

The company recently raised the monthly output rate at the local factory to eight jets, a new high for the plant.

Boeing watchers have speculated that the aerospace giant could one day be rolling out anywhere from 12 to 16 new 787s every four weeks after a second assembly line is completed in 2028.

Meanwhile, Volvo Cars will start building its top-selling XC60 at its underutilized Ridgeville plant to jumpstart U.S. sales and reduce exposure to new tariffs on overseas-made cars.

Production of two versions of the electric-gas hybrid now made in Sweden is expected to begin in Berkeley County by late 2026. They'll be built alongside the sluggish-selling all-electric EX90 and another EV that made for Sweden’s Polestar brand.

Volvo said it also plans to add a fourth model to its local lineup but no details beyond it being a yet-to-be named hybrid have been released.

Data center opposition dominates local politics Winning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.","SPRING CITY, Pa., Jan. 4, 2026 (AP) — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.

Communities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.

In many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.

But as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.

“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania's East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”

Opposition spreads as data centers fan out

A growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.

Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.

“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.

Data Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.

Between April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.

Some environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.

“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.

In Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.

Similar concerns across different communities

For some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.

Losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.

Lawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.

Big Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.

Microsoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”

Even with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.

Maxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.

“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”

Some in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.

Still, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.

“It's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.

Data center opposition dominates local politics

Winning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.

Developers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.

The project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.

Had council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That's for sure.”

In Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.

Residents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.

They say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.

“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.

Documents revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.""

Rebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.

She found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.

“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.

The program targets fleet-focused customers such as security operations, municipalities, campuses, grounds maintenance teams and commercial facilities.

The fleet and commercial vehicle program focuses on organizations that need reliable electric utility vehicles for high-utilization, year-round operation. The initial product emphasis centers on Massimo’s newly introduced MVR HVAC electric vehicle series, the company said.

Fleet-Focused Product Differentiation

The MVR HVAC series features fully enclosed cabs with heating and air conditioning. This design improves operator comfort, productivity and reliability across varied climates and duty cycles.

Massimo positions the MVR platform as a differentiated solution for fleet customers that require consistent performance regardless of weather conditions. That capability is becoming increasingly important for public-sector and enterprise users.

The company expects the MVR HVAC lineup to play a central role in the fleet and commercial vehicle program. The vehicles support extended operating hours, reduced downtime and applications where operator comfort and safety are critical.

Go-To-Market Strategy

As part of the rollout, Massimo plans to engage directly with fleet and commercial customers. The strategy includes participation in national and regional trade shows, targeted outreach and dedicated fleet-focused sales efforts.

These initiatives aim to accelerate customer engagement and support pilot deployments. Massimo also plans to use the program to establish long-term relationships with procurement decision-makers.

The fleet and commercial vehicle program is designed as a scalable platform. It supports repeat purchasing, multi-unit deployments and longer vehicle lifecycles compared with traditional consumer retail sales.

Expansion of Massimo’s Growth Platform

“As we continue to evolve our business, fleet and commercial customers represent an important opportunity to expand Massimo’s addressable market and strengthen revenue diversification,” said David Shan, chief executive officer of Massimo Group. “The launch of our Fleet & Commercial Vehicle Program, supported by the MVR HVAC series, reflects our focus on practical innovation, disciplined execution, and building products that meet the real-world demands of professional users.”

These catalysts should enable the utility to capitalize on growing power demand by data centers in Florida.
Powerful total return potential Utilities expect to grow their earnings briskly in the coming years as they invest heavily to support surging power demand by AI data centers.","AI has the potential to be a powerful technology. However, access to power will be crucial to the technology's adoption in the future. AI data centers require significantly more electricity compared to those handling traditional workloads due to the specialized chips and cooling systems needed to keep these facilities running at full capacity 24 hours a day, every single day.

As a result, utilities could be big winners in the AI age. They should have considerable opportunities to invest capital into expanding their power generation capacity and the related infrastructure to support their expanded operations. That should empower them to grow their earnings and dividends at faster rates in the future, enabling them to produce powerful total returns for their investors.

Here are some of the utilities in the best positions to cash in on the AI boom.

NextEra Energy

NextEra Energy (NEE +0.81%) operates the country's largest electric utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL). It distributes electricity to 12 million people across the state of Florida. Additionally, the company owns one of the country's largest energy infrastructure development companies (NextEra Energy Resources).

The state of Florida is in a strong position to capitalize on the AI data center boom. It has a state sales tax exemption for data centers over 100 megawatts. Meanwhile, FPL has the first and only approved large load tariff in the state. These catalysts should enable the utility to capitalize on growing power demand by data centers in Florida.

Meanwhile, NextEra Energy Resources should be an even bigger beneficiary of the AI power boom. The entity develops and operates a range of clean energy infrastructure, including natural gas pipelines, electricity transmission lines, and various forms of clean power generation capacity, such as natural gas, nuclear, and renewable energy. The company has a strategic relationship with Google to develop nuclear energy and data center campuses. These catalysts support NextEra Energy's view that it can grow its adjusted earnings per share at more than 8% annually over the next decade, while also continuing to increase its 2.8%-yielding dividend.

Dominion Energy

Dominion Energy (D +1.11%) provides regulated electricity services to 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The company's electric utility in Virginia will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom because the state is one of the world's largest data center markets.

The company is investing heavily to build out the necessary power generation capacity and related infrastructure to support the coming surge in power demand. Its current capital investment plan is $50 billion in the 2025 through 2029 time frame, with Dominion Energy Virginia seeing the bulk of that investment. Included in that capital is 50% of the costs to build the $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project that Dominion expects to complete in 2026.

Dominion Energy expects its current investment rate to support 5% to 7% annual earnings-per-share growth over the long term, based on 2025's level. The company plans to maintain its current dividend rate (4.5% yield) to allow its growing earnings to lower its dividend payout ratio. However, its dividend should rise with its earnings growth rate once it achieves its more conservative payout target.

Entergy

Entergy (ETR +1.55%) produces, transmits, and distributes electricity to 3 million customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. It expects power demand in its operating areas to surge in the coming years, driven by a 13% to 14% compound annual growth rate from industrial customers, such as data centers.

For example, Meta Platforms is building a $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana, with power supplied by Entergy. The utility is constructing two new gas-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 1.5 GW to power the data center. Entergy secured gas supplies from pipeline giant Energy Transfer to provide fuel for these facilities and others.

Entergy plans to invest $41 billion between 2026 and 2029 on new power generation capacity and related infrastructure. Additionally, the company has signed power purchase agreements with third-party power producers to provide it with additional electricity. For example, NextEra Energy is developing up to 6.2 GW of renewable energy and storage capacity for Entergy over the next few years. These investments support Entergy's expectations that it can deliver more than 8% compound annual earnings-per-share growth through 2029. That should enable the utility to continue increasing its 2.8%-yielding dividend.

Powerful total return potential

Utilities expect to grow their earnings briskly in the coming years as they invest heavily to support surging power demand by AI data centers. When added to their dividend income, these stocks could generate strong total returns for investors in the future.

""By 3:23 a.m. (0223 UTC/GMT) on 4 January, we had been able to restore power to around 7,000 households and 150 businesses in several stages, particularly in the Lichterfelde area,"" Stromnetz Berlin announced on its website overnight.

Suspected malicious act

The partial restoration of power means that some 38,000 homes and more than 2,000 businesses remain without electricity in the district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, with Stromnetz Berlin saying it could take until Thursday afternoon to remedy the problem completely.

The outage, which leaves many of those homes without heating, comes as the city is experiencing a bout of very cold winter weather.

The affected district contains several care homes and medical facilities. Emergency services have transferred residents from at least two homes for the elderly.

The loss of power was caused by a fire at a cable link over the Teltow Canal that police are investigating as a possible arson attack after a letter sent to authorities claimed responsibility.

A spokeswoman for Berlin's Senator for Economic Affairs Franziska Giffey said authorities believed that a malicious act was behind the fire.

The authenticity of the letter is being examined, but no group has been identified as a certain perpetrator so far.

However, Berlin's state leader, Mayor Kai Wegner of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), said the culprits were ""obviously left-wing extremists,"" whom he accused of endangering people's lives with their actions.

A Berlin police spokesman also said that it was ""credible"" that the letter was written by a left-wing extremist group calling itself the ""Vulkangruppe"" (Volcano Group), as the letter claimed.

He said, however, that the investigation was still ongoing.

Police call for better surveillance

The head of the Berlin branch of the GdP police union, Stephan Weh, called the attack ""senseless"" and without any legitimation, ""even if the suspected arsonists again throw together all sorts of hypocritical reasons in a pamphlet on the end of the world.""

He called for an ""unideological"" debate on video surveillance in view of the fact that so many thousands of people were affected.

""Cameras mounted on electricity poles could help investigations but also have a preventive effect. We do without protective technology in the public space just because some people cry out loudly and cite Orwell's '1984,'"" he said.

His words were echoed by Alexander Schirp, the director of the regional business associations in Berlin and Brandenburg (UVB).

""We are expecting damage costing millions to plants and machines and owing to high losses in revenue,"" he said, calling for better protection of infrastructure against attacks and accidents.

""This is a serious problem and stokes a feeling of insecurity in the business world,"" he said.

Stromnetz Berlin said there had been a similar attack on two power pylons in the city's southeast in September that was politically motivated.

We recently published 10 Stocks Already Shocking 2026 With Massive Gains. Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSEAmerican:UUUU) was one of the top performers last week.

Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSEAmerican:UUUU) saw its share prices jump by 13.9 percent week-on-week, as investors raised their exposure to energy firms believed to largely benefit from the cold months and the US nuclear renaissance this year.

The stock rallied alongside its counterparts as traders placed bets on the sector’s “seasonal strength,” with households and businesses expected to ramp up consumption to power their heating appliances during the winter season.

The White Mesa Mill—a mine site owned and operated by Energy Fuels Inc. Photo from Energy Fuels website

Higher energy demand is expected to indirectly benefit the uranium sector, including Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSEAmerican:UUUU), as nuclear companies would need to expand their uranium fuel consumption to run their plants.

In an updated report last month, the US Energy Information Administration said that it projects retail energy price forecasts to pick up amid a colder-than-usual winter season.

In the broader front, the uranium and nuclear sectors are poised for an expansion this year, thanks to the US government’s commitment to a nuclear renaissance, where more projects are expected to be developed in support of the growing demand from the artificial intelligence and manufacturing sectors.

The policy direction followed President Donald Trump’s executive order early last year aimed at accelerating nuclear development to support national security.

While we acknowledge the potential of UUUU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Read Long Reads Autocar Professional Person of the Year 2025: Sudarshan Venu The global two-wheeler industry is undergoing a rare shake-up.","The final week of 2025 and the opening days of 2026 offered a natural pause for the Indian automotive industry to take stock of a year that was anything but ordinary. What began on a cautious note ended with record sales months, structural shifts in market leadership, and a growing sense that India’s auto ecosystem is entering a more mature, execution-driven phase.

Calendar year 2025 closed with India’s passenger vehicle industry crossing critical milestones. Monthly wholesales breached the 400,000-unit mark for the first time in December, electric vehicle sales hit record highs across cars and two-wheelers, and exports remained a pillar of growth even as global uncertainty persisted. The numbers confirmed that GST rationalisation, easing interest rates and a steady recovery in rural demand helped the market regain momentum after a volatile start to the year. At the same time, the sales data also revealed deeper structural trends–SUV dominance, the resilience of value-led models like the Dzire, and the widening gap between leaders and laggards.

Beyond the spreadsheets, the week was also defined by narrative shifts. The idea of EV leadership itself came under scrutiny, with Tesla’s once-unquestioned dominance giving way to a broader debate about scale, manufacturing depth and long-term execution. In India, automakers and suppliers alike sharpened their focus on systems, localisation and profitability rather than disruption alone. That theme resonated strongly with Autocar Professional’s Person of the Year 2025, Sudarshan Venu, whose steady, execution-led leadership has propelled TVS Motor into the global top tier while redefining India’s electric two-wheeler landscape.

Policy and institution-building developments added further layers. The PLI Auto scheme crossed a major investment milestone, underlining the government’s role in anchoring India’s manufacturing ambitions. New standards for electric agricultural tractors pointed to the widening footprint of electrification beyond urban mobility. Leadership changes at Hyundai Motor India, fresh IPO filings, cybersecurity incidents and renewed investment activity all signalled an industry that is expanding in breadth.

Here’s the detailed round-up of all major developments from this week:

India's PLI Auto Scheme Crosses ₹35,657 Crore Investment

India's Production Linked Incentive scheme for the automotive sector has achieved significant milestones, with cumulative investments reaching ₹35,657 crore and incentive disbursements totaling ₹2,321.94 crore as of December 31, 2025. The scheme has catalyzed the production of over 13.6 lakh electric vehicles while generating nearly 49,000 jobs, according to an official announcement by the Ministry of Heavy Industries.

JSW MG Bets on Extended Buyback to Address EV Resale Concerns

Concerns over the resale value of electric vehicles remain one of the key hurdles to faster adoption of EVs in India. While OEMs have introduced assured buyback programs, JSW MG Motor is now offering an extended buyback program that guarantees a fixed resale value for EVs for up to five years.

The automaker says this extended buyback program is an “industry-first initiative” for mass market EVs to boost consumer confidence, as most of the other OEMs offer a buyback program for only up to three years. The program, which guarantees 40-60% resale value, builds on the company's existing buyback program, which is for up to three years.

Anti-Dumping Duties on Chinese Cranes May Lift the Game for ACE

For years, the Indian market for high-capacity truck and crawler cranes has been dominated by Chinese manufacturers, helped by cheaper domestic steel, state support, and soft financing that left them 30–40% cheaper than Indian rivals. The Central Government now proposes anti-dumping duties of roughly 35–40% on Chinese cranes, covering truck cranes up to 160 tonnes and crawler cranes up to 260 tonnes, in a move that would significantly narrow this price gap.

India’s mass passenger vehicle (PV) industry closed calendar year 2025 on a strong note, with December wholesale volumes underscoring a broad-based recovery driven by policy support, easing inflationary pressures and sustained consumer demand. The industry’s domestic dispatches rose 26% YoY in December to 404,229 units, marking one of the strongest monthly performances in recent years and reinforcing the view that the sector has entered a structurally stronger phase after several quarters of volatility.

The rebound was led by a combination of favourable macro conditions, most notably GST rationalisation, easing interest rates, and a revival in rural demand, alongside aggressive product actions by automakers. The revival was broad-based, with seven of the top ten mass PV manufacturers reporting YoY growth, and momentum extending across SUVs and entry-level hatchbacks.

Electric Car and SUV Sales Hit Highest Level in CY2025: 176,500 Units

The Indian electric passenger vehicle segment, in tandem with the electric two- and three-wheeler segments, has registered its best-ever calendar year retails in CY2025. At 176,538 units, the year-on-year increase is a massive 77%.

Proof of the growing demand for zero-emission cars, SUVs and MPVs is seen on Indian roads as PV buyers prefer to put their money on a wallet-friendly EV, despite the higher initial price compared to their petrol or diesel brethren. Between 2015 and 2024, over 425,000 electric PVs have been sold in India.

Hero MotoCorp December Sales Rise 40%, Following Festive-Led Growth in November

Hero MotoCorp reported a 40 percent year-on-year increase in total two-wheeler dispatches in December 2025, continuing the growth momentum seen in November, though overall volumes declined on a month-on-month basis after the festive season.

The company dispatched 456,479 units in December, compared with 324,906 units in December 2024, and above market expectations of around 400,000 units. This compares with November 2025 sales of over 600,000 units, when dispatches rose 31 percent year-on-year, supported by festive demand and strong retail traction.

Insights & Interpretations

Tesla Uncrowned

The electric vehicle story is often told as a race for sales, market share, or technological firsts. But that framing misses the deeper shift now underway. What we are witnessing is not the arrival of electric mobility, but a change in what leadership in this industry truly means. Tesla once turned electric cars into belief, aspiration, and cultural inevitability. Today, the centre of gravity is moving from narrative power to industrial depth, from charisma to systems, from disruption to execution. This piece is about that transition and about what happens when a story-led revolution collides with the hard mathematics of scale, manufacturing, and long-term dominance.

Accelerating Battery Manufacturing Ecosystem in India

India's energy future is increasingly reliant on advanced battery technologies, which are indispensable for powering electric vehicles (EVs) and facilitating the storage of renewable energy from burgeoning solar and wind sources. This national drive is fuelled by rapidly rising energy demand and a decisive governmental shift towards clean technologies.

India has set ambitious targets, including achieving 30% EV sales penetration and reducing projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030; and committing to net-zero emissions by 2070. These objectives underscore a profound strategic commitment to sustainable mobility and energy independence.

The article covers current challenges associated with indigenous development of raw materials, battery cell manufacturing, equipment/ machinery development so to meet the growing demand for energy storage systems both for the electric mobility and stationary storage applications.

India Reclaims Growth Momentum as Policy Support and New Models Lift Auto Market

After a sluggish start to the year, India’s passenger vehicle market regained momentum in the last quarter of 2025, driven by GST 2.0, falling interest rates, and new model launches at attractive prices, reviving demand.

While growth remained moderate rather than spectacular in the first 9 months due to a high base and a slowing economy, the industry clawed back lost ground and closed the year with volumes estimated at around 4.58 million units, making India the second-fastest-growing large car market globally after China.

The recovery came amid slowing global demand and persistent geopolitical uncertainty. Yet, unlike several mature markets that saw stagnation or contraction, India managed to sustain forward momentum, aided by a combination of price correction beyond the GST cut, portfolio expansion, and improving consumer sentiment around the festive season.

Canada’s closest neighbour and biggest trading partner is driving massive political and economic restructuring. This has created great political and economic unease among Canadians at a collective and personal level.

These new threats have also forced public attention away from clean energy, climate change, plastic pollution, urban sprawl and chemical pollution. Unfortunately, many polluting industries have seized upon this moment to maximize their profits — lobbying decision-makers to roll back progress and carry out attacks on long-standing environmental protection rules and legislation.

These industries argue that it’s for the greater good — but is it? Evidence from history shows that societies succeed in the long term when they integrate protection of the environment into the economic and social development strategies. Those that do not tend to fail. In fact, for the first time in human history, scientifically conclusive evidence is telling us that moving forward economic progress must be grounded in what is best for the environment.

As we move into 2026, Canada has the opportunity to get some key things right to chart a course towards a better future. Here are our predictions for the biggest environmental wins coming our way next year.

Nation-Building Projects:

This year, the federal government has been hyper-focused on nation-building projects. Next year, we will advocate for these projects to align with moving Canada towards clean energy, climate action and protection of nature. Some ones to watch are:

High Speed Rail: The proposed route would run from Toronto through to Ottawa and Quebec City. This train would dramatically cut travel times and highway traffic and increase business and personal productivity. It would also replace fossil fuel powered planes with electric powered trains. Building it should also involve restoring forests and wetlands and delivering benefits to communities. We hope to see another route announced for Edmonton to Calgary.

Wind West: This renewable energy project would see the creation of massive offshore wind farms in Nova Scotia that could then be sent west to provide up to 25% of Canada’s electricity needs. We expect to see federal support help to move this project ahead and help remove the need for costly and polluting gas plants that are being pushed forward in Ontario and Alberta.

Clean Steel: It is key to Canada’s future competitiveness that we increase our steel exports to places outside of the U.S. (who has slapped big tariffs on it). A great way to do this and also reduce pollution is to switch from fossil fueled furnaces to electric ones. This will make our steel cheaper to manufacture and also more attractive to purchasers who want green steel. Algoma Steel has this process underway and great progress stands to come in Hamilton and in Quebec.

Public Transportation: The best way to have less gridlock is to have less cars on the road and that happens when commuters are given viable and affordable choices. Watch for action to roll out a focus on building more public transit infrastructure, giving existing transit greater priority on streets and increasing the frequency of how often a bus or a train comes.

Forever Chemicals:

The jig is up on the long-hidden truth about the risks of Polyfluoralkyl chemicals (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals”, to people and the environment. These include developmental effects, cancers and disruption of hormone regulation. These chemicals are found in a plethora of everyday products including non-stick coatings, menstrual products, and furniture. Fortunately, after long delays, 2026 is a year when we expect to see action by the federal government to ban at least some of the most egregious PFAS. We will be pushing for action on all of them.

Ontario Deposit Return:

If you live in Ontario, you’re probably sick of seeing littered plastic drink bottles.2026 is the year when we expect to finally see the Ontario government move to adopt a new deposit-return program that will put a price on non-alcoholic drink containers and, as a result, greatly increase recovery and recycling rates. It is not hard to do and 8 of the other 10 Canadian provinces already have successful programs in place.

Clean Energy:

The fossil fuel industry has worked hard to block renewable energy projects. Fortunately for all of us, the price of solar, wind and battery storage systems has dropped so dramatically that it will become increasingly difficult to convince citizens to stick with expensive and polluting gas and oil. Watch for an ongoing shift from gas furnaces to heat pumps and from gas plants to renewable energy production projects.

Electric Vehicles:

EVs will be back in style as both consumers and our governments recognize that they are better value and less polluting. There is no future for Canadian automakers and the jobs they provide if Canada tries to join the US in sitting out the move to EVs. We think we’ll be seeing more affordable EVs and a major government push on charging infrastructure.

Sustainable Housing:

Big changes to the rules that guide building in our cities will come this year. In the place of regulations that have prevented mid-rise buildings (think four stories with six apartments), we anticipate cities and towns will recognize that the housing crisis will be partly solved by encouraging more of this type of building. This will allow us to densify our existing neighbourhoods rather than relying on environmentally destructive urban sprawl.

No new pipelines:

Finally, the cynical Alberta-Federal MOU that undercuts Canadian climate action will run up on the rocks of its own making. Oil demand is expected to peak by the end of this decade, meaning the massive increases in oil sands production and risky bitumen pipeline to the British Columbia north coast make no economic sense. These projects will never move forward. We’ll be reading the MOU’s epitaph well before year-end.

Our vision for 2026 is clear: a Canada where clean water, a safe climate, and healthy communities ground all our efforts to create economic and social prosperity.

He said export realisations were currently around $446–448 per tonne FOB, compared with London white sugar prices of about $426 per tonne.
He said around 1.5–2 lakh tonnes of sugar have been contracted so far, with 50,000–60,000 tonnes already exported.
On the domestic front, he said India began the season with opening stocks of about 50 lakh tonnes, and sugar production is progressing well.
Total output for the season is estimated at around 345 lakh tonnes, while domestic consumption is projected at 284–285 lakh tonnes.","The Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) has urged the government to rationalise GST on flex-fuel vehicles and higher ethanol blends in the upcoming Union Budget, saying the move would support clean mobility while helping stabilise the ethanol ecosystem.

The Director General of ISMA, said GST on flex-fuel and strong hybrid vehicles should be reduced to 5 per cent, in line with electric vehicles, from the current rate of around 18 per cent.

“For a clean technology like EVs, the GST is 5 per cent. There is no reason why the same rate cannot be extended to flex-fuel and strong hybrid vehicles, which are also clean technologies,” he told ANI in an interview.

He also called for a reduction in the GST on higher-ethanol-blended fuels such as E85 and E100. He said bringing GST down to 5 per cent from 18 per cent would make these fuels cheaper than conventional petrol and boost consumer adoption.

Sugar prices in India

On sugar exports, he said India was permitted to export 15 lakh tonnes of sugar in November, though shipments have been slow due to weak international prices. He said export realisations were currently around $446–448 per tonne FOB, compared with London white sugar prices of about $426 per tonne.

“There is no parity in sugar prices as Indian prices are higher than global prices at present,” he said, adding that exports are expected to pick up from January as Brazilian sugar supplies ease.

He said around 1.5–2 lakh tonnes of sugar have been contracted so far, with 50,000–60,000 tonnes already exported.

On the domestic front, he said India began the season with opening stocks of about 50 lakh tonnes, and sugar production is progressing well. Total output for the season is estimated at around 345 lakh tonnes, while domestic consumption is projected at 284–285 lakh tonnes.

Even after accounting for ethanol diversion and exports, he said closing stocks are expected to remain high at around 59–60 lakh tonnes, putting pressure on domestic prices.

He also flagged challenges for the ethanol sector after achieving the E20 blending target, citing limited consumption beyond 20 per cent and low allocation to distilleries, which have impacted viability in several states.

Tesla said Friday that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world’s richest man. The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump’s marketing effort early last year when he called a news conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected. Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell 2.6% to $438.07 on Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

Cheaper models haven’t reversed downward trend

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn’t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business. He has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.

Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.

To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers. It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges. The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.

“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We’re dealing with people’s lives.”

Still, Ives said he expects Tesla’s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.

Personal wealth pushing new frontiers

Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.

To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to $67 million.
Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.
For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere.
“Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right.”","The Millers are a family of beekeepers in Gackle, North Dakota, a tiny farming town about 70 miles east of Bismarck. It was five decades ago when they began their labors here amid the endless swaths of sweet clover, alfalfa and the variety of other plant life that bees love.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to $67 million. All of it courtesy of these undulating fields of wild grasses, and the buzzing insects who return to them each year.

“It was bee paradise,” said Jason Miller.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it is the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a U.S. renewable fuel standard in part to decrease dependence on foreign oil. In 2021, President Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of 3 billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for U.S. corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

Biofuels also can be made from animal fats, algae, waste cooking oils or agricultural waste such as wood chips and straw. While the Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce SAF, the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope is a fait accompli.

In the last year, U.S. production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House, the Trump administration just unfroze a $1.67 billion Biden-era loan for biofuel processing plants.

The downside of making jet biofuel from corn or soybean production is that it will likely fuel significant land transformation, according to several expert analyses, including one by Braden Limb, a research scientist at Colorado State University. According to his study, about 50% more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet the 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we’ve converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb. And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment-and people like Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a $400 million paid U.S. pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybee populations already face a number of stressors – disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: Only a year ago U.S. beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, per an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to corn.

“What I fear is that we’re not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

But as demand for air travel soars, so does aviation’s climate impact. According to the International Air Travel Association, air traffic rose more than 10% between 2023 and 2024, making it one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation contributes roughly 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions but is responsible for at least 3.5% of human-caused climate change.

Airlines have been exploring the few options available to lower emissions, including SAF. The industry has committed to biofuel use and the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would require significant biofuel inputs. Researchers such as Limb point to crops other than corn or soybeans, like sorghum and miscanthus, that can be used for biofuel but are not as damaging to ecosystems.

“All of our optimization work,” Limb said, “says corn and soybeans are not the answer.”

There are forces at work that may yet forestall the mass repurposing of grasslands for biofuel. In 2022, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, created by Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, crafted more incentives for domestic production and sale of low-carbon transportation fuels. But the Republican tax and spending bill passed this summer, while extending the credit, decreased the $1.75 per gallon credit for SAF to $1. Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clearcutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialized equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF – including virgin vegetable oils – are typically more expensive than other biofuels.

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies continue to express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in gasoline blends used in land transportation, organizations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

Another driver of aviation biofuel is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), an initiative that aims to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions from international flights. CORSIA is a three-phase international agreement. The first two phases were voluntary, but beginning in 2027, CORSIA becomes mandatory for most of international aviation, with some exceptions. Under the agreement, airlines must measure, report, verify and offset emissions that exceed the 2019 baseline.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.

Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels,” said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov. 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the U.S. biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that the U.S. exported almost 2 billion gallons of corn ethanol last year. “If U.S. exports decline,” he said, “then we will need to find ways to increase domestic consumption-increasing land use change pressure.”

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources – used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes – could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

Back in North Dakota, Klett said beekeeping families like hers and the Millers remain worried about what comes after that uncertainty lifts.

“Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/C2VQJpHdOU84q1e9DnTd8IRBW58=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2026/01/01/69571de8bdadf.hires.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:02:55.673768

Advocates worried that without this office, chronic pain research coordination across the NIH and HHS would suffer.","Dawn Gibson can literally feel storms coming in her bones.

“I’ll start feeling like this gnawing and throbbing in my bones and joints,” the 48-year-old suburban Detroiter said. “I get this feeling like my body is getting very heavy, and it’s almost like those old diving suits with the big window in front.”

Imani Barbarin, in Philadelphia, sometimes feels like her pain is better at predicting the weather than the app on her phone.

“It kind of builds; usually I feel it most in the morning the day of [the storm],” the 35-year-old said. “It’ll be like, something’s off, and it’ll be sunny outside, like I don’t get it. Then all of a sudden it’ll just be all cloudy, pouring out rain.”

Gibson and Barbarin are among the more than 50 million Americans who have some form of ongoing, regular pain—the fastest growing chronic condition in America. Gibson suffers from ankylosing spondylitis and fibromyalgia, which both lead to widespread pain throughout the body and overall fatigue, while Barbarin has cerebral palsy.

And for as long as people have reported recurring pain that doesn’t respond adequately to treatment, they’ve complained about the weather making it worse. Atmospheric changes intensifying pain “is a common complaint among people with persistent pain” said Dr. Corey Simon, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Duke University, who sees patients coping with it in his practice.

There is a library of studies trying to understand the connection between chronic pain and weather, but no single theory has prevailed in the medical establishment. Nonetheless, patients, clinicians and epidemiologists all agree that weather is a factor in some pain. Now, as climate change slowly remakes weather patterns and atmospheric trends, a new question is emerging: Is global warming increasing the torment of those suffering from chronic pain?

The Agony of a Rapidly-Increasing Chronic Condition

Everyone feels pain, from the immediately sharp, but then dull throb of a stubbed toe, to the searing sting of a cut hand sliced while peeling vegetables or the deep soreness of heavy bruises from a fall down the stairs. While this kind of discomfort can fade quickly, chronic conditions can bring prolonged, often life-long agony that disables many people. Chronic pain both vividly colors and darkens the everyday experience of those who suffer it, according to Barbarin, a disability advocate.

“A dull ache is kind of like my normal,” she said. “I feel it on my feet all the time. I feel it on my hips, in my back.”

This rise in chronic pain is happening alongside a big increase in autoimmune disorders since 2017, said Dr. Tamiko Katsumoto, clinical associate professor of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University. The outcome is now that chronic pain is “our most prevalent chronic health condition, number one cause of disability globally, [and] most expensive,” Nicholson said. Half a trillion dollars are spent annually on chronic pain treatments, many of which don’t work.

Weathering Pain That’s Hard to Study

Elderly osteoarthritis patients often complain that cold, wet conditions make their pain worse, Simon, at Duke University, said. Dr. Sara Wallace, an orthopaedic surgeon and assistant professor at the University of Chicago Medical Center, has seen similar pain triggers in her patients.

“I can say anecdotally that most patients who come to the door, if not all patients with arthritis, will tell you that when the weather changes, when it’s going to rain outside, when it’s going to snow, patients do say that their pain is worse,” she said.

Rain, or stormy weather, is often associated with lower barometric pressure. “If the barometric pressure, for example, outside goes down, then that may allow the joints to swell in the body,” potentially increasing pain, Wallace explained.

“There’s a lot more variability in day-to-day pressure during winter than summer” in the United States, said Steve Vavrus, Wisconsin State climatologist and assistant director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This could explain the “wet and cold” connection that Simon and Wallace have been observing.

For Barabarin, even weather conditions this mundane can be devastating.

“There are some days where I just become so jumbled up,” she said. “Sometimes I just can’t get my body to cooperate, and that’s not necessarily pain, but it’s also environmentally implied too.”

In a scenario in which the pain occurs in a variety of winter conditions that occur simultaneously—wet, cold, low barometric pressure—it can be hard to identify the meteorological source of pain. Such atmospheric complexities can make research at the intersection of chronic pain and weather even more inconclusive.

As osteoarthritis is a fairly common cause of chronic pain experienced by many older people globally, it’s drawn a lot of research and made people in their sixties a somewhat uniform population to study. But even with consistency among the patients studied, the results vary widely.

U.S.-based researchers in 2007 found that older American patients felt more arthritis pain with high barometric pressure. In 2015, researchers in Northern Europe found that osteoarthritis patients throughout Europe experience worse pain in colder, more humid conditions and barometric pressure had little impact. A study published in 2014 that immersed older adults in cold water found that their pain tolerance decreased when exposed to frigid conditions. But then two Australian studies published in 2016 found that weather had limited impact on chronic musculoskeletal pain in people over 40.

Timothy McAlindon, a rheumatologist and professor at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School and a co-author on the study focused on Americans, thinks that investigating only the physiological connection between weather and pain is why these studies are not conclusive. He pointed out that people “have their own prior hypotheses” that inform their perceptions of pain.

Psychology, particularly mood and memory, really influences perception of pain related to weather, McAlindon, Wallace and Simon agree.

“If your mood has been very positive, very high, then you may, generally speaking, experience less pain in your body,” Wallace explained. “Whereas, if your mood is kind of low and maybe you have some seasonal associated depression, maybe you notice that joint pain more.”

Volatile, climate-driven weather shifts can drive mood swings, as well as “climate grief” and “eco-anxiety.”

Additionally, if the weather has you trapped inside, you lose your ability to exercise, which can help alleviate pain from osteoarthritis, Wallace and Simon both explained.

Exercise is also key to maintaining good mental health. But for many folks with varying degrees of pain and disability, walking outside might be the only form of exercise available to them, Gibson added, and that might become more difficult if climate change brings more heat or precipitation to their community.

The myriad weather impacts on mental health and mood can lead people to fixate on their pain more when the weather is poor, Simon said. Humans have a tendency “to invest in patterns” which can lead to “confirmation bias,” he noted.

“Such biases can lead us to remember pain on poor weather days [rather] than pain on good weather days.”

A prolonged poor mood can turn into chronic stress, which can make pain worse by triggering the body to release cortisol, which increases inflammation, Katsumoto said.

Collaboration Challenges Hinder Research

Though deeply unsettled, research on chronic pain and weather exists. But studies of chronic pain explicitly related to climate change do not, and atmospheric scientists and epidemiologists seldom collaborate on research into the topic.

“The data are in different formats,” Vavrus said. “There’s just a different language spoken between the different fields.”

Few of the many weather and pain studies include atmospheric scientists. The research often treats weather as though it’s fixed throughout the day, with few looking at how temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and precipitation fluctuations over a 24-hour time period might affect pain.

It’s hard to make conclusions “if you only have one data point,” Vavrus said. If these studies did incorporate meteorology as it changes, research might be more robust, but the complex challenges of comprehensively determining what climate change is doing to weather will make figuring out its impacts on pain even more difficult.

Global warming is bringing more heatwaves and an atmosphere that sucks up more moisture to feed storms. Those thermodynamic effects of climate change often have more clear ties to pain. For example, gout sufferers living in Arizona—which will continue to get hotter and dryer as global temperatures increase—will likely experience worse pain due to more frequent and severe instances of dehydration driven by the increasing temperatures and aridity. That’s on top of the exacerbation of the pain by the heat itself.

Anna Samson, a 26-year old writer and disability advocate from Toronto, has axial spondyloarthritis (a form of arthritis) and fibromyalgia. When temperatures start getting into the upper 70s, it feels like “the slightest movement takes all the effort in the world,” she said via email. And high humidity can send her literally reeling.

“[Humidity], in particular, instantly makes me dizzy,” she added. “It feels like running into an invisible wall, and I have to sit or lie down until my head stops spinning.”

“My joints will feel slow and sticky, like they have hot, burning glue inside them,” she said. “It makes everything difficult to do.”

One irony of the warming climate is the possibility that it could bring more polar vortexes of unusually frigid temperatures to otherwise temperate parts of North America. The strength of the polar jet stream that circulates around the Arctic is driven by the North Pole being much colder than the equator. But with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, that differential between warm and cold temperatures has decreased. And some scientists have proposed that the polar jet stream is slowing down and starting to wobble like a top that’s about to stop spinning, with its teetering dropping cold, polar air to more temperate, lower-latitude regions like Michigan.

“There’s good theoretical reasons why we would expect that climate change should generally slow down the strength of the westerly polar jet stream,” Vavrus said.

“My joints will feel slow and sticky, like they have hot, burning glue inside them. It makes everything difficult to do.”

— Dawn Gibson

For folks susceptible to cold this is ominous news, and a way climate change impacts on atmospheric dynamics could worsen chronic pain.

Three years ago, Gibson was diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome, which causes decreased blood flow to the extremities. In cold weather, such as when frigid Arctic temperatures descend to lower latitudes, this can cause pain and even lead to frostbite—health challenges that Gibson is facing more often than she expected in a warming climate.

“When we have a polar vortex, I try not to go outside, because there is a very real chance of something bad happening,” she said.

Torment During and After Tempests

The increasing incidence and severity of climate-driven extreme weather events complicates the lives of those experiencing chronic pain during extreme weather events and also in their aftermath.

Those pains and the stress of the extreme weather that brought them on pile up into an emotional toll that can also manifest itself physically.

“Our streets were flooded. People lost so many items. It’s emotionally oppressive,” Gibson recalled. “When these big storms come now, or there’s a potential for these big storms, I do feel this terrible dread.”

The looming threats of displacement, loss of valuables or harms to loved ones can spike levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with stress reactions, which increases many forms of chronic pain, Katsumoto said.

Climate change is also altering when, where and how humans are sickened by infectious disease. Vector-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, dengue fever, chikunguna and malaria have all become more prevalent and widespread as global temperatures warm, a trend that researchers expect to continue. And autoimmune diseases—many of which cause repetitive pain—are “oftentimes triggered by infections,” Katsumoto said.

“Not to mention that autoimmune disease patients are immunosuppressed,” she added, “so they’re going to be more susceptible to infections.”

Some medications prescribed to treat pain have side effects that can be more dangerous as the climate warms. Gibson takes duloxetine, an antidepressant that also treats chronic pain, but like other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression, the drug substantially reduces the heat tolerance of the people who take it. The increasing frequency, severity and duration of heatwaves make this and similar pain management medications more dangerous to prescribe.

“If you’re on [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors], you can’t live where it’s too hot any longer.” Barbarin warned. “You will die.”

Federal Urgency Wanes as Diagnoses Increase

Autoimmune diagnoses have been rising, in general, even without the potential increases climate change could bring.

“Our wait times have gone up tremendously,” Katsumoto said about healthcare providers who treat rheumatic diseases like arthritis, gout and Lupus. If climate change increases incidents of pathologies that bring chronic pain, it will increasingly stress the healthcare services disabled people rely on, she said.

All of this comes as the Trump administration is narrowing the research scope of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, key agencies for monitoring chronic illness, Barbarin and Katsumoto said.

Before the start of the second Trump Administration, funding for pain research at the NIH was about two percent of the agency’s annual research budget. Pain advocates had lobbied Congress for nearly a decade to double that amount, said Christin Veasley, co-founder and director of The Chronic Pain Research Alliance, at a conference in August.

But this past April, the Trump Administration proposed a 40 percent funding cut to the NIH, including terminating the Office of Pain Policy and Planning. That office coordinated chronic pain research activities across the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services, and facilitated both public-facing and Congressional communication on chronic pain research. Advocates worried that without this office, chronic pain research coordination across the NIH and HHS would suffer.

There was, however, hope this summer that those cuts wouldn’t be permanent.

“Some perceived the president’s budget as merely a proposal and others looked at it more of like a policy framework by which they would start negotiating,” Veasley said in August.

While some of the 2025 NIH cuts have been reversed, almost $38 million in pain-related research funding was terminated and around $74 million remains frozen, according to Grant Witness, which is tracking Trump administration cuts to scientific research agencies. These terminated and frozen grants comprise roughly 27 percent of pain-related funding from the NIH. When Inside Climate News asked specifically about the future of the Office of Pain Policy and Planning, the NIH Press Team wrote that “as the [office] was not responsible for conducting or funding research activities, its closure does not impact the scope or continuity of federally supported scientific research.”

But Linda Porter, former director of the Office of Pain Policy and Planning, worries that the office’s closure could upend “decades of progress in enhancing federally funded pain research.”

“The value of NIH research arises not simply from ‘conducting or funding research activities,’ but also from careful evaluation of the current research endeavor, how it benefits the lives of people who it is meant to serve, and how best to move research into the future,” she wrote in response to the Press Team’s statement. “The Office also developed and oversaw training programs for the next generation of researchers, provided networking channels for communication across research disciplines and with people who live with pain.”

Veasley told Inside Climate News via email that the Chronic Pain Research Alliance and other pain advocates “have not gotten any indication that the Office will reopen.”

Cuts to pain research also coincide with steep reductions in federal climate research funding.

This year, the number of geoscience grants awarded by the National Science Foundation, which often fund meteorology and climate science, have dropped by 35 percent relative to the yearly average over the last decade. And with the Trump administration targeting federal climate science with budget cuts, staff reductions and the removal of data from federal websites, getting funding from Washington for research at the intersection of global warming and pain is virtually impossible.

As questions about their continued suffering go unanswered by government-supported research, Barbarin said many disabled people are leaning on one another, and using each other’s anecdotes to better understand their conditions. Online forums, like Reddit, provide critical community spaces. The r/ChronicPain subreddit has been around since 2009, and has 87,000 weekly visitors with 4,600 weekly global contributors who often discuss their struggles with their conditions. The number of posts about weather-triggered pain have ticked steadily upwards over the past three years.

“It’s weirdly comforting to realize I’m not alone in this, but also frustrating how much control the weather seems to have over my body,” one contributor wrote. “It’s like a predicting super power,” another user responded about their chronic pain.

For now, sharing their experiences with one another might be the most reliable way forward.

“When you have something that is a lot unknown, that means you have to live and make your life work while you’re waiting for the science to catch up,” Gibson said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2247506229-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 06:15:28.237161

Former President Joe Biden's policies set the changes in motion, and successor Donald Trump may take the credit. But the real winners are Korea's LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and SK On, who will be better able to take on China.

US demand for lithium-ion batteries, used to power cars and store energy, has been accelerating, but domestic supply failed to keep pace: consequently, for storage alone, the country has imported more than $100 billion in batteries and components since 2021, according to S&P Global, roughly half of which came from China. Increasing reliance on the People's Republic – total lithium-ion battery shipments grew 15-fold in the decade to 2024, per International Trade Centre data – worried policymakers.

Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act flipped the script. The scheme awarded generous credits for local investment and production, slashing battery-making costs by 30 percent, the Center on Global Energy Policy estimates. Setting up factories was especially enticing for Korean giants, since Chinese rivals, including the world's largest battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology, were effectively excluded. Now, the country could see an oversupply of lithium-ion batteries as soon as 2026, per Benchmark Minerals forecasts.

South Korean producers have invested some $20 billion to build out capacity, per S&P, and will account for more than two-fifths of the growth in production between 2025 and 2029, Benchmark Minerals estimated in 2024. The US was LGES's largest market by sales in the first half of 2025, and SK On expects to have more than doubled its capacity there in that year, compared with 2024.

That's feeding through to earnings. LGES and Samsung will turn a 2025 loss to a 2026 net profit of $700 million and nearly $400 million, respectively, according to Visible Alpha. SK Innovation's battery subsidiary SK On needs longer to reach profitability, but revenue will increase around 50 percent in the year ahead, Jefferies estimates. While Trump terminated electric-car subsidies in September, the energy storage market is growing quickly due to demand from AI data centres, and manufacturers are retooling production to cater to the latter.

There are other perks. Higher overall sales drive economies of scale in sourcing and also research. That, coupled with the lack of Chinese competition, has helped the Koreans play catch-up in commercialising lithium ferrous phosphate chemistry, a cheap and long-lasting kind of battery in which China's players until recently boasted a global monopoly. LGES is now producing LFP products in the US while Samsung begins production in 2026, and SK On is in discussions with automakers. The US is also a good testing ground for alternatives like lithium manganese-rich cells. That will help the three in other major markets like Europe.

There are risks too. If the AI boom slows or Americans steer clear of electric cars, then excess supply could pressure prices, eroding the US industry's profitability. And American or even Chinese policymakers may yet deliver nasty surprises: Beijing still controls supply chains for the raw materials like graphite that go into battery cells and so could hamper production if trade tensions rise again.

TSMC’s N3 Fab Commissioning: completion of its second Arizona fab in 2028.","Deep within Arizona’s arid landscape, two of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers—Intel and TSMC—are transforming vast stretches of sun-drenched topography into the epicenter of America’s chipmaking revival. Both companies have drawn global attention for their massive investments and technological ambition, but there is a crucial difference between their operations.

Intel’s newly constructed Fab 52 stands as the most advanced semiconductor factory on U.S. soil, while TSMC’s Arizona fabs represent a significant relocation of Taiwanese semiconductor mastery to U.S. soil. These vast industrial footprints obscure a complex environmental challenge regarding how these facilities will balance technological leadership with resource sustainability in one of the most water-stressed regions of the world.

The promise of Arizona as a burgeoning ‘Silicon Desert’ semiconductor hub reflects more than competition. It represents a national effort to secure advanced manufacturing and reduce dependency on Asia while fueling the growing demand for artificial intelligence hardware. Yet, as massive capital investments reshape the desert infrastructure, critical questions remain:

How can precision manufacturing sustain itself while relying on millions of gallons of water daily?

Can “greener” engineering truly offset the enormous energy and environmental costs of making chips for the AI era?

These inquiries highlight the friction between industrial growth and environmental limits.

Key Semiconductor Statistics: Intel and TSMC Arizona Quick Facts

Intel Fab 52: Located in Chandler, Arizona, part of Intel’s Ocotillo campus. Built for Intel 18A process technology featuring RibbonFET and PowerVia. The designed capacity targets roughly 40,000 wafer starts per month, positioning the facility within a competitive comparison of Intel’s Fab 52 and TSMC’s Arizona fabs, where production volumes are expected to exceed regional rivals by 2027.

TSMC Arizona Fab 21: Located near Phoenix. Began high-volume production in late 2024. This expansion roadmap includes advanced N4 and N3 process nodes that will facilitate future N2 technology integration near Phoenix.

CHIPS Act Funding: Intel has secured $7.86 billion in direct CHIPS Act funding to accelerate U.S. manufacturing efforts, while the federal government has finalized a $6.6 billion U.S. CHIPS incentives package for the Phoenix fabrication campus.

Sustainability Metrics: Intel reports net-positive water use in Arizona and 100% renewable electricity since 2012. TSMC targets 90% water recycling by 2028 through an Industrial Water Reclamation Plant.

Comparing Chip Capacity: Intel Fab 52 vs. TSMC Arizona Infrastructure

Initial comparisons suggest Intel’s Fab 52 appears to exceed the technical specifications of TSMC’s Phoenix operations in nearly every measurable way. It is physically larger and designed for a more advanced process node. Furthermore, it is equipped with a higher number of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines—the most expensive and critical tools in modern chip production. Reporting from Tom’s Hardware indicates that Intel’s Arizona campus may eventually host as many as fifteen EUV scanners once all facilities reach full capacity.

Physical scale, however, does not translate directly to immediate market impact. While Intel’s new fab represents unmatched potential throughput, its Intel 18A node is still in the early phase of yield optimization. Tom’s Hardware notes that world-class yields are not expected until early 2027, meaning much of the plant’s output capacity will remain underutilized for the next several years. TSMC, by contrast, began producing chips on its proven N4 node in 2024, ensuring that its Arizona fabs contribute to commercial supply chains sooner, even if the process technology is slightly older.

This shift underscores a recurring industry cycle in semiconductor manufacturing: ramp-up is everything. While Intel may ultimately achieve a larger footprint and finer transistor geometries, TSMC’s experience with high-yield production gives it a near-term advantage in stability and output. The real competition is not over who builds the biggest factory, but who achieves consistent yields first—the moment when every wafer reliably produces profitable chips.

The Intel 18A Advantage: Revolutionizing Performance with RibbonFET and PowerVia

Intel’s Fab 52 is not just another facility; it is the cornerstone of the company’s strategy to establish a new benchmark in transistor density and performance. Built on Intel 18A technology, this fab will be the first to fully deploy RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, two innovations designed to deliver faster performance and lower power consumption. These technologies are critical for next-generation AI accelerators, cloud processors, and high-performance computing chips.

The Intel 18A node will underpin the company’s reemergence as a foundry for external clients. This shift supports a dedicated foundry business for external chip customers while the company scales up contract manufacturing. The Intel 18A foundry partnership with Microsoft for next-generation AI silicon illustrates how Fab 52 anchors a broader domestic ecosystem of AI-focused chip designs built on U.S. soil. Together, those commitments position Intel as a potential domestic alternative to Asian foundries for leading-edge manufacturing once yields mature.

Engineering Precision in the Cleanroom Environment

From an engineering standpoint, each wafer processed at Fab 52 moves through hundreds of ultra-precise steps inside cleanrooms that filter particles measured at the sub-microscopic level. Advanced semiconductor fabrication requires a continuous, high-volume water supply, yet Intel has emphasized sustainability from the start. The company claims 100% renewable electricity use across its Arizona operations and reports restoring billions of gallons of water annually through conservation and watershed projects.

TSMC Arizona Fab 21: Diversifying the Global Semiconductor Supply Chain

The TSMC Arizona manufacturing complex presents a different but complementary narrative. Its Fab 21 began high-volume manufacturing in late 2024 using the N4 process, an advanced but mature node that already powers many of today’s smartphones and graphics processors. High-volume manufacturing began in late 2024, signaling the commencement of TSMC Arizona chip production following federal grant approvals and laying the groundwork for future nodes.

Beyond the technology race, TSMC’s U.S. presence strengthens semiconductor resilience, reducing the concentration of fabrication capacity in East Asia. Its Arizona complex will eventually represent an investment exceeding $65 billion and employ thousands of local workers. TSMC’s commitment to sustainability is reflected in several key project milestones:

Solar Integration: The site will integrate 14.5 megawatts of solar generation.

Renewable Offsets: The facility will utilize renewable energy credits to offset 100% of its power use.

Water Reclamation: A new Industrial Water Reclamation Plant, scheduled for 2028, targets 90% water recycling.

These targets ensure that TSMC’s presence contributes to the region’s environmental goals.

Comparing Corporate Strategies: Predictable Output vs. Leading-Edge Ambition

TSMC’s steady approach contrasts with Intel’s high-stakes bid for leadership. By starting with proven process nodes, the company ensures immediate output and revenue flow, even as it builds the infrastructure for more advanced technologies. Together, Intel and TSMC’s projects represent a powerful signal: America’s chipmaking resurgence depends as much on long-term sustainability and diversification as on raw production capacity.

Sustainable Chip Manufacturing: Innovative Water Restoration and Recycling Strategies

Advanced semiconductor fabrication requires a continuous, high-volume water supply. To produce a single silicon wafer, thousands of gallons of ultrapure water (UPW) are needed to meticulously clean and rinse microscopic surfaces. In a desert environment, this requirement becomes a sustainability challenge as much as an engineering one. Intel and TSMC are addressing it through different but complementary approaches aimed at making water a circular resource rather than a consumable.

Intel has achieved net-positive water use in Arizona by restoring more water to local watersheds than it withdraws. Through 21 water restoration projects and advanced on-site recycling systems, the company recycles and reuses billions of gallons annually.

The Ocotillo campus also operates a large water reclamation facility. This site processes wastewater for reuse within the fab network, significantly reducing overall demand on municipal supplies.

TSMC, meanwhile, is constructing an Industrial Water Reclamation Plant (IWRP) that will come online by 2028, capable of recycling up to 90% of process water. The facility will also use renewable electricity, integrating with 14.5 megawatts of solar generation at the Arizona site. Current projections for TSMC’s water use and industrial recycling suggest daily demand could reach tens of millions of gallons, but the strategy aligns with data center cooling innovations designed for dry regions that prioritize extreme water efficiency.

The challenge extends beyond water. Both companies are committing to renewable power agreements to ensure energy-intensive chip fabrication aligns with state and federal sustainability goals. These strategies are not just environmental goodwill—they are practical responses to the growing scrutiny of manufacturing footprints in the age of climate accountability.

Overcoming Yield Challenges: The Reality of High-Volume Production Ramps

Although these campuses anchor the resurgence of U.S. chip production, their operational realities remain tethered to a single, unforgiving metric: yield. Capacity projections are irrelevant until every wafer that enters the fab exits as a functional chip. The Intel 18A node currently navigates the complex phases of process maturity, meaning its massive infrastructure advantage cannot yet translate to matching output volumes.

TSMC’s Arizona operation, leveraging its well-established N4 node, offers a contrast in predictability. The company can deliver reliable wafers more quickly, reinforcing its reputation for consistent yield performance. However, as it transitions toward N3 and N2 production in the next few years, it too will face the challenge of scaling complexity in an unfamiliar environment with a U.S. workforce still ramping up to full experience levels.

For both manufacturers, success depends on synchronization between tool readiness, workforce expertise, and supply chain logistics. The supply chain now includes everything from advanced packaging to the ultrapure quartz industry. The industry recently faced storm-driven disruptions in North Carolina’s quartz supply for AI chip manufacturing, revealing how environmental events can halt the global supply chain. Until all of those pieces align, output will lag behind design capacity, tempering the enthusiasm behind billion-dollar investments and reminding policymakers and industry watchers that ramp efficiency defines true competitiveness more than building size ever could.

Silicon for the AI Era: Impact on Climate Technology and Grid Optimization

Semiconductor fabs are not only about hardware; they sit at the heart of the energy transition and the digital future. AI accelerators, data center processors, and renewable energy management systems all rely on cutting-edge chips to process petabyte-scale datasets with high efficiency. Software and hardware are increasingly optimized through carbon-aware computing for hyperscale data centers to maximize work per kilowatt.

The fabrication techniques being refined in Arizona today will ripple into climate modeling, grid optimization, and medical research tomorrow. Research into photonic chips for data center networking and monolithic 3D AI chips that deliver fourfold energy gains at a U.S. foundry illustrates how each new generation of silicon is trying to push past the energy wall that now constrains AI growth. Emerging breakthroughs in photonic chips for networking and monolithic 3D AI architectures demonstrate how silicon can push past current energy limits.

Addressing the Advanced Packaging and Supply Chain Bottleneck

At the same time, a critical bottleneck persists in advanced CoWoS-style compute packaging, which remains a primary hurdle for high-end accelerator supply. This constraint reminds policymakers that wafer capacity alone will not solve AI supply shortages. In the broader context, these fabs embody the convergence of clean technology and national security. The CHIPS Act funding model demonstrates how public investment can accelerate innovation while enforcing accountability through measurable sustainability outcomes. As the AI economy grows, the carbon cost of computation will increasingly depend on the efficiency of the chips and the integrity of the manufacturing processes that produce them.

What to Watch Next (2026–2028)

The success of Arizona’s semiconductor corridor depends on meeting several critical milestones between now and 2028:

Intel’s 18A Ramp: achieving high-yield production by early 2027.

TSMC’s N3 Fab Commissioning: completion of its second Arizona fab in 2028.

Water Recycling Benchmarks: Intel maintaining net-positive performance; TSMC activating its IWRP to reach 90% recycling.

CHIPS Act Accountability: progress reports tied to funding disbursements and job creation metrics.

These targets provide a measurable roadmap for assessing the impact of multi-billion dollar industrial investments.

The Future of Arizona’s Sustainable Silicon Fab Hub

The industrial transformation occurring in Arizona is a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of technical excellence. Intel’s Fab 52 and TSMC’s expansion are more than just factories; they are test cases for a new era of responsible manufacturing where yield and sustainability are no longer mutually exclusive. As these giants ramp up production of 18A and N3 nodes, their legacy depends on the ability to deliver the silicon required for the AI economy without compromising the environmental integrity of the desert that hosts them.

Looking ahead, the Arizona corridor stands as a blueprint for the global semiconductor industry. By proving that net-positive water use and high-volume recycling are achievable at scale, these facilities are redefining what it means to be an industrial leader in the 21st century. The legacy of the Silicon Desert will not be found in the millions of chips shipped, but in the enduring lesson that technological progress must ultimately harmonize with the preservation of our most vital natural resources.

Essential Insights into Arizona’s Semiconductor Hub

What makes Intel 18A technology unique for AI?

Intel 18A introduces RibbonFET and PowerVia, allowing for significantly higher transistor density and more efficient power delivery, which are essential for the massive computational demands of modern AI models.

How does TSMC manage water recycling in a desert?

TSMC is launching a state-of-the-art Industrial Water Reclamation Plant (IWRP) by 2028, designed to recycle up to 90% of the ultrapure water used during the manufacturing process.

Why is the Silicon Desert critical for the U.S. economy?

The concentration of Intel and TSMC facilities in Arizona secures a domestic supply of leading-edge chips, reducing reliance on overseas foundries and creating thousands of high-tech jobs.

What role does the CHIPS Act play in these Arizona projects?

The CHIPS Act provides billions in direct funding and incentives to accelerate the construction of these fabs, ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in global semiconductor innovation.

Can these massive factories truly achieve net-positive water use?

Yes, Intel already achieves this in Arizona by funding watershed restoration projects that return more water to the environment than the Ocotillo campus consumes annually.",https://www.intelligentliving.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Intels-Fab-52-vs-TSMC-Arizona-Fabs-The-Silicon-Desert-Capacity-Boom-Meets-a-Water-Reality.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:57:33.621152

DS and BR: A once a day action is a first step toward broader actions, so it is difficult to track the actual impact of the Campaign on meat consumption.
These data indicate that Meatless Monday is making an impact on how many people think about and consume meat.","Meatless Monday has been active for over 20 years. Would you recount the original idea and how the campaign started?

DS: Meatless Monday recently celebrated its 20th Anniversary in 2023. The campaign was founded in 2003 by Sid Lerner- a leader, philanthropist, and marketing savant who used the art and science of advertising to promote healthy behaviors worldwide – in partnership with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Meatless Monday was inspired by the meat reduction campaigns and “meatless days” during World War I and World War II. The simple concept of “cutting out meat one day per week” was clear, memorable, and easy to understand and encouraged participants to take small steps towards lifestyle changes. Meatless Monday materials, resources, and programming were made free to the public and could be easily customized for any organization, community or individual. Today, organizations and communities worldwide have adopted Meatless Monday to promote healthy, sustainable eating habits and better food choices among their employees, students, staff, and constituents. The beloved movement, which can be found in over 40 countries and translated into 20 languages, continues to grow year after year.

How did John Hopkins collaborate in forging the general concept? And how is it backing the Meatless Monday campaign?

BR: The Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) has been the science advisor to Meatless Monday since the beginning. As the story goes, in 2003, recalling the meatless days of the World Wars, ad man Sid Lerner and Dr. Bob Lawrence, the founding director of the Johns Hopkins CLF created “a public health campaign with a creative grassroots marketing strategy” to encourage people to reduce their meat consumption by skipping meat once a week. This reduction was in accordance with a 2000 report by the Surgeon General and the American Heart Association, recommending that Americans reduce their meat and saturated fat consumption by 15 percent. (According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2010 agriculture and forestry produced 24% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Animal agriculture alone accounts for 14.5% of all global greenhouse gas emissions. As the body of evidence has grown, the goal of the campaign has expanded to harness the actions of individuals, communities and institutions to address the health of the planet by reducing the environmental burden associated with meat production.)

CLF works closely with Meatless Monday to ensure their materials, messages and social media resources align with the best science and evidence base. Furthermore, CLF’s research, education and communication undergirds and informs Meatless Monday’s strategy and approach as a gateway toward a healthy, just and sustainable food system. Most recently, CLF worked with Meatless Monday to launch the Meatless Monday Resource Center, which is housed and managed at Johns Hopkins. This will ensure the Campaign is embedded at JHU and will continue to provide evidence based materials and resources for individuals and organizations interested in implementing Meatless Monday.

You define yourself as a movement and encourage people to cut meat consumption. Is Monday the best day to change a behaviour?

DS: Meatless Monday is simply an idea, a marketing concept that other people, communities and organizations can leverage to encourage healthier eating habits. Since 2003, it’s grown into a grassroots, organic global movement, active in more than 40 countries, having a positive impact on our health, our environment, and our communities.

Research does show that the start of the week – Monday -is the day people are most open to trying healthy behaviors. Monday offers a weekly opportunity to “reset” and get back on track. Studies show that people who start a healthy habit at the beginning of the week are better able to maintain progress over time.

Meatless Monday’s message to “skip meat once a week” works because it provides a regular cue to take action on Monday, which research shows is the day people are most open to making positive changes. Starting each week by participating in Meatless Monday can lead people to eat more fruits, vegetables, and plant-based meals the rest of the week.

Which is the most effective way of educating consumers?

DS: Meatless Monday is an easy and delicious first step toward making healthier habits. When educating consumers we try to meet them where they are. We encourage starting small by eating plant-based just one day a week and to use this as an opportunity to not only understand the benefits of meat reduction for our health and the health of the plant, but to explore culinary creativity. Many favorite meals can be made plant-based. We offer a ton of cooking tips, swaps, recipes and resources to help people get started.

We suggest trying the Meatless Monday Challenge – a free 12 week email campaign delivered to your inbox each Friday. You can also find more inspiration on our Resource Center, Instagram and by signing up for the Meatless Monday newsletter.

BR: Another effective strategy for encouraging consumers to reduce meat consumption is through modifications in the food environment. When the desired food is visible, tasty, common (meaning often chosen by others) and easy to access, consumers are more likely to make the healthy, sustainable choice. This research shows that education and choice architecture strategies complement each other. By providing recipes, ideas, knowledge and community, Meatless Monday is an effective and fun step toward healthy, sustainable change.

Which are the beneficial effects of increasing beans consumption for human health and the environment? Are there recent studies providing new data?

BR: Beans are multi-talented when it comes to health and the environment. Beans are high in protein, resistant carbohydrates and fiber. They contain good amounts of important nutrients – some of which are also in animal products, such as iron and zinc, and others that are unique to plants, such as folate, fiber and polyphenols. Frequent bean consumption is linked to lower rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, healthier microbiomes, and lower BMIs. A recent dietary analysis demonstrated that bean consumers had higher quality diets overall and consumed more of several shortfall nutrients including choline, alpha-linolenic acid (a poly-unsaturated fat) folate,iron, magnesium and vitamin E.

Beans produce markedly lower amounts of greenhouse gas emissions than animal foods. Producing a serving of lentils produces 173 times less CO2 equivalents than a serving of beef. Beef and other ruminants require more than 20 times more land than pulses per unit of protein consumed, and producing 1 kg. of beef requires 15,000 liters of water, while 1 kg. of beans takes only 360 liters. Finally, beans are especially good for promoting biodiversity and soil health, thus increasing the nitrogen use efficiency, improving yield and reducing disease.

Beans have been cultivated for food over 10,000 years, and nearly every culture has a bean dish. They are versatile and can be adapted to almost any cuisine and menu. Despite the importance of beans, global consumption has not changed much over the past four decades. There are huge opportunities to promote beans for individual and planetary health.

We often overconsume proteins, especially when it comes to dietary patterns for athletes or people who aim to lose weight. What do you think about this trend?

BR: Protein needs vary from person to person depending on their health, activity and body composition; however, most Americans and Europeans (consumers in high income countries) meet or exceed protein requirements. There is also a wide range of acceptable, healthy protein intake. A person who eats 2000 calories per day could consume from 50 to 175 grams and stay within the U.S. Institute of Medicine recommendations.

While protein is an important macronutrient for growth, preservation of lean body mass and immunity, protein is plentiful in many foods we eat across all food groups. Protein from grains, vegetables and starches contribute to total protein intake along with protein from meat, seafood, dairy, beans, nuts and seeds. Diets that are diverse and well-balanced are nearly always plentiful in protein.

The current trend for prioritizing protein intake over other macronutrients and consuming well beyond requirements is based on protein’s reputation as clean, satiating and beneficial for weight loss, but it comes at a risk, particularly depending on the type of protein food people consume. For example, we know that diets high in red and processed meats are associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The proliferation of protein supplements that are under-regulated and may contain toxins and untested ingredients also carry risks. Overconsumption of protein foods can also lead to underconsumption of other healthy, nutrient rich foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Long term studies show that diets balanced in complex carbohydrates, proteins and healthy fats are associated with the best outcomes.

As mentioned before, beans and legumes are excellent sources of protein and do not carry the same risks as high consumption of red and processed meats. Meeting protein needs with beans, legumes, nuts and seeds is healthy for people and the planet.

Nearly 40% of Americans have heard of Meatless Monday and 1 in 5 Americans reported to have participated in Meatless Monday. Are there indicators about a decline of meat consumption in the US?

DS and BR: A once a day action is a first step toward broader actions, so it is difficult to track the actual impact of the Campaign on meat consumption. We do have research findings that confirm that people who practice Meatless Monday also reduce meat in other ways throughout the week, such as eating smaller portions, choosing meatless meals when dining out or preparing meatless meals on other days of the week. These data indicate that Meatless Monday is making an impact on how many people think about and consume meat.

In the US, meat consumption has continued to slowly increase over the last two decades. Although poultry has grown at a faster rate, pork and beef still make up the bulk of meat consumption. Interestingly, new research shows that more households are actually avoiding or decreasing meat purchases, but the increase in meat purchases across other households (by an average of 15% by weight) mask these reductions. Further analysis suggests that the share of households not buying meat was driven by a combination of price changes and cultural shifts related to age and other factors.2
